pomt-08792	A New York imam wants to "have a mosque at Ground Zero.''	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/19/rick-lazio/ground-zero-mosque-ground-zero/	In all of the debate over the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, we thought it made sense to start with the most basic fact-check -- whether it was accurate to even call it the Ground Zero Mosque or a mosque at or on Ground Zero? For the sake of discussion, we picked a statement from gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who said in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on Aug. 17, 2010: "If you take ... this imam at face value who says that this is about healing divisions, why would you want to have a mosque at Ground Zero when you know it's opening the wounds of the families of the victims of 9/11 that are still feeling this pain as if it was yesterday?" The phrase "Ground Zero Mosque" has become a bit of media shorthand for the heated political issue, and has been used by a number of political figures discussing the propriety of the mosque's proposed location. For example, in a campaign ad, Rick Scott, a Republican candidate for Florida governor stated, "Mr. President, Ground Zero is the wrong place for a mosque." The proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it. But it is near Ground Zero. How near? Just over two blocks. The Washington Post has an interactive map of the location in relation to the World Trade Center site, including actual panoramic views. The addresses of the buildings in question are 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, between West Broadway and Church Street. That's two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. Two long blocks, in fact. The Washington Post noted that the location is "roughly half a dozen normal lower Manhattan blocks from the site of the North Tower, the nearer of the two destroyed in the attacks." According to Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, the site is as close to City Hall as it is to Ground Zero. "You can’t see Ground Zero from our current building and on completion of our planned building some years from now, there won’t be any views of the Ground Zero memorial from the building," Gamal said in a July 24, 2010, interview with altmuslim.com, an Islamic news site. So it's not at Ground Zero, but the proposed location for the mosque is close enough to have symbolic value -- as was acknowledged by those trying to build it. The Washington Post noted that the top of the 5-story building --formerly a Burlington Coat Factory -- was damaged by landing gear from one of the planes used in the attacks. In an Aug. 8, 2010, story in Newsweek, Daisy Khan, wife of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who would lead the mosque, said the location had symbolic import. "We want to provide a counter momentum against extremism. We want peace, and we want it where it matters most. This is where it matters most." The plan for the center includes a September 11th memorial, Gamal said in his interview with altmuslim.com, "and quiet reflection space where people of different faith traditions and beliefs, sacred and secular, can find quiet time and solace." While we're considering the term "Ground Zero Mosque," we also wondered whether it was proper to call the project a mosque. A mosque is, in fact, planned there, but it's part of a plan for a much larger, $100 million cultural center. According to the project web site , plans include a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios and childcare services. Organizers say the center would be open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith, and would promote cultural diversity. The center would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors and they say membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward "engaging New York’s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all." A mosque is also planned, though according to the site it would be run separately from the rest of the facilities. According to Gamal, the mosque would not tolerate "any kind of illegal or unAmerican activity and rhetoric." Imam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings since 2009. Again, we realize many politicians and media figures are using the phrase the "Ground Zero Mosque" -- or as Lazio did, "a mosque at Ground Zero" -- as shorthand to describe the controversial project. It's nearby -- close enough to carry symbolic value to those who oppose it, and even to those proposing the project. But we think those characterizations often give the misimpression that the project is either on the old World Trade Center site or immediately next to it. And that's not right. And so we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10125	"I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke [in March 2007], and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/barack-obama/2007-was-too-late-to-head-off-the-crisis/	The country's economic woes were a somber topic at the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008, with both candidates explaining their thoughts on the root of the crisis. "I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it." It's undisputed that Obama wrote the two officials a letter on March 22, 2007. "There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures," Obama wrote. "Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge." ( Read the full text here .) But Obama brought up this letter in the context of explaining the current economic crisis. There's nothing to suggest in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008. His letter is concerned with people losing their homes, not a systemic threat to the economic system. (See our story and other statements on potential causes of the economic crisis here.) We also checked news clips to look at Bernanke and Paulson's public statements around the time after Obama sent his letter. • On March 28, 2007, Bernanke testified before Congress, saying, "Although the turmoil in the subprime mortgage market has created financial problems for many individuals and families, the implications of these developments for the housing market as a whole are less clear." • On May 15, 2007, Bernanke gave a speech in which he discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. " We should always keep in view the enormous economic benefits that flow from a healthy and innovative financial sector," Bernanke said. • On May 17, 2007, Bernanke said the Federal Reserve was considering taking steps to rein in subprime lending, but would be cautious not to overregulate. "We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system," Bernanke said. • On June 20, 2007, Paulson said, "We have had a major housing correction in this country. ... I do believe we are at or near the bottom." So it sounds like Obama's letter didn't make much of a splash. Certainly Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells. We asked two economists, one with a right-leaning group and one with a left-leaning group, if a warning issued in 2007 could have made a difference to the problems of October 2008. Both of them said it was too late by then, because the questionable loans and securities had been issued by that point. "The horse was already out of the barn," said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Everyone with a brain who was paying attention knew that there were big problems associated with outstanding subprime risk," said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But, he added, "There was little that the Fed could have done after March 2007 to prevent the crisis from happening." So Obama is right that he wrote the letter. Saying Bernanke and Paulson didn't do anything about it sounds harsh, but it is a rough approximation of what happened. But Obama's letter was largely confined to the problems of low-income homeowners who were losing their homes. It was not an early warning on the economic collapse of '08. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-13T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['Ben_Bernanke', 'Henry_Paulson']
pomt-05015	Says Mitt Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/16/barack-obama/mitt-romney-had-millions-swiss-bank-account-barack/	President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign is using hard-edged irony to attack Mitt Romney in a new ad that pairs Romney singing "America the Beautiful" with a series of claims about Bain Capital and his use of offshore accounts in his personal finances. In this item, we’ll look at the claim that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account." Romney has released tax returns for 2010 and an estimated tax return for 2011, in addition to a number of financial disclosure forms. Each of these forms is lengthy and, unless you're an accountant, difficult to decipher. However, the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account" is not in doubt, since the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged it in an on-the-record call with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012. Malt said on the call, "Yeah, it occurs to me that one other question that came up. … Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romney's tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003, when I became trustee of the blind trusts. It is a bank account. Nothing more, nothing less. An ordinary bank account. It earns some income, which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the (2010) tax return. You'll see approximately $1,700 of interest earned by this account, which is reported. The tax is fully paid just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that." Malt added, "By the way, I did close this account in early 2010. It no longer exists." Reporters on the call offered two follow-up questions about the Swiss bank account. One asked, "Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010?" Malt responded, "I previously said that I regularly review Gov. Romney's investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews, I decided that this account wasn't serving any particular purpose. It might or might not be consistent with Gov. Romney's political views. You know, again, taxes were all fully paid, etc., but it just wasn't worth it, and I closed the account." The second question asked the Romney camp to "elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account, how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations." Malt responded that "the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust. It held approximately $3 million. It was just an investment of the trust -- the bank account of the trust -- which, as I mentioned, I have subsequently closed. The bank was, sorry, Union Bank Switzerland -- UBS." Malt’s comments confirm that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account" because the couple filed their returns jointly, and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romney’s trusts and family trusts, not just Romney’s funds. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign also retroactively disclosed that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form, apparently the same one that was closed in 2010. In the 2006 disclosure form, the UBS money market account was listed as being worth between $1 million and $5 million. We should note that there’s no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account -- assets, we’ll reiterate, that were placed in the account by Malt, not by Romney. The purpose of a blind trust is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the U.S. Treasury. Income from the account was included in the Romney’s tax returns and all U.S. taxes due were paid during the period, the campaign said. Our ruling The trustee who managed Romney’s holdings has publicly confirmed that Mitt and Ann Romney had "approximately $3 million" in assets in a Swiss bank account between 2003 and 2010, and the Romney campaign did not object to that characterization when we contacted them for this story. Swiss bank accounts may make good fodder for campaign commercials and Jason Bourne movies, but there's nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account. While it is now closed, the claim in Obama’s ad was stated in the past tense -- that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account." That’s correct, so we rate Obama’s claim True.

pomt-06879	"This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/29/allen-west/allen-west-says-spending-cuts-are-part-debt-ceilin/	U.S. Rep. Allen West supports Speaker John Boehner's plan for cutting spending and raising the debt ceiling, even though some of his fellow tea party supporters have been skeptical. On July 27, 2011, he appeared on CNN to defend the plan. "We can sit around and try to come up with the 100 percent plan, and this plan definitely is not it," said West, R-Plantation. I'll give it about a 70 to 75 percent rating. But it is a plan that I can take and I can execute to 100 percent. I think the most important thing when I look at this, it still does fit within the framework that I'll support of cut, cap and balance," he said. "So I'm very pleased that I can stand to support this because we don't have the tax hikes that I don't want to see happen, and we don't have the complete blank check that's going to be given to the president of $2.4 trillion. This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts," he added. We should point out that raising the debt limit does not give the president "a blank check." Congress still retains its usual power to approve or deny spending. We looked at a similar statement from Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, and rated it False. Here, we were interested in West's point that this was the first time a debt ceiling vote had ever been paired with spending cuts. Was this year's debt proposal that historic? In a word, no. We spent a long time mulling the details of federal legislation over the past 30 or so years. We found a few different examples that contradict West's statement. The most recent example of legislation to raise the debt ceiling that also included spending cuts was the 1997 agreement between President Bill Clinton and House Republicans led by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five years and increased the debt limit to $5.95 trillion, from $5.5 trillion, according to a 2005 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The deal included spending cuts, tax cuts and new spending on social programs supported by Clinton. At the time, the agreement was expected to lead to a balanced budget by 2002. In fact, the budget went into surplus in 1998. (Keep in mind that there was still substantial public debt at this point, but at least the government wasn't spending more than it took in during a given year.) News coverage from the 1997 deal depicted it as a great victory for the Republicans, though one with bipartisan support. Here's how USA Today's story began on July 31, 1997: The Republican-led House of Representatives, savoring the afterglow of a successful engagement with a Democratic president, voted overwhelmingly Thursday for a spending plan that should balance the federal budget by 2002. The measure sailed through the House by a lopsided 346-85 vote on a wave of bipartisan self-congratulation, standing ovations and paeans to the promise of protecting generations to come. Speaker Newt Gingrich, who in past years has conceded being outmaneuvered by President Clinton on the budget, triumphantly announced the vote. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, strode onto the House floor clapping his hands in anticipation of leading the Senate debate to a similar conclusion today. After the debt ceiling was raised in 1997, it wasn't raised again until the George W. Bush administration in 2002. The debt ceiling was raised seven times during the Bush administration, and it's been raised three times already during the Obama administration. We found two other examples of budget agreements that included automatic mechanisms to cut spending. The 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act set caps to cut discretionary spending along with new pay-you-go rules, and that too included a debt ceiling increase. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 set strict deficit targets and automatic spending cuts if the yearly deficit targets were breached. Lawmakers knew that the automatic spending cuts were virtually certain to take effect, and they did. "The debt ceiling has been used numerous times in the past to enact both budget enforcement procedures and actual spending cuts, often to make debt ceiling increases more politically palatable," said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. As we finished our research, we wondered if West meant whether it was the first time the spending cuts had equaled the increase in the debt ceiling. The 1997 agreement would not meet that criteria. Even if that's what he meant, that's not how West phrased his statement on CNN. West said, "This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts." We found that the 1997 budget agreement raised the debt ceiling and also included spending cuts. So we rate his statement False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-07-29T14:55:56	2011-07-27	['None']
pomt-04237	A precinct in the Allen West-Patrick Murphy recount has "7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!!"	false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/20/facebook-posts/viral-post-claims-precinct-allen-west-race-had-900/	Election night found U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in unfamiliar territory: He hadn’t won, but he wasn’t convinced that he had lost either. West clearly lost his first bid for Congress against U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, in 2008. And two years later, he clearly thumped Klein. But on the night of Nov. 6, 2012, state results showed Democrat Patrick Murphy narrowly ahead but outside of recount territory in one of the most expensive and high-profile U.S. House contests in the country. (West beat Klein in Congressional District 22 but then moved due to redistricting. You can read our full West fact-check file here.) By the morning, West demanded a closer look at results in Congressional District 18, which spans parts of Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Martin counties. Most of the controversy centered on St. Lucie, which had trouble counting ballots. That led to a whirlwind two weeks of court hearings, partial recounts, a visit by state election officials to monitor the mayhem, scrutiny of St. Lucie County election supervisor Gertrude Walker and around-the-clock news coverage. Every morsel was put under the microscope, including Murphy’s false claim that West had never shaken his hand, prompting the West campaign to point to a photo of the two candidates shaking hands at a debate. A Nov. 18 article in the Palm Beach Post paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson raising questions about St. Lucie’s ballot counting. "Among them: Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered, Edson said." The claim that about 900 voters casting ballots in a precinct with only 7 voters went viral and was repeated on a CBS news website and on a West fan page on Facebook. "#AllenWestRecount - A Pct had - 7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!! - THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL YET - The commissioner has NOT announced ANYONE the winner or the numbers yet. They are STILL behind closed doors." On Nov. 20, West conceded, though he continued to raise questions about St. Lucie County results. On the same day, a PolitiFact reader asked us about a claim he found on Facebook about Precinct 93. He asked us "Is this true and newsworthy? Or is it just conservatives whining that they lost?" So we went in search of what went down in Precinct 93 -- otherwise known as Golden Ponds Recreation Center in St. Lucie County. St. Lucie County and the ‘bungled’ count First, some more background on the West-Murphy postelection battle in St. Lucie County, which started election night when the county had trouble reading ballots on tabulation machines. You can read blow-by-blow accounts from the Palm Beach Post or the Associated Press. As the door on West’s chances appeared to be closing, the Palm Beach Post wrote Nov. 18: "The St. Lucie County Canvassing Board missed a noon Nov. 18th deadline to file results to the state Division of Elections so that left previously submitted certified unofficial results standing: Murphy was ahead of West by about .58 percent." The root of the confusion about Precinct 93 Part of the West campaign claim isn’t in dispute. The St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections website shows seven active voters in Precinct 93 -- three Democrats, three Republicans and one "other," as of September 2012. Unofficial results dated Nov. 11 on the supervisor’s website showed that in Precinct 93, three ballots were cast for West and three for Murphy. We spoke to Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a volunteer attorney for the West campaign, on Nov. 20. He said that volunteers watching the recount during the Nov. 18th weekend saw a ballot-counting machine with a yellow Precinct 93 sign on it and the tabulation tape showed 1,552 ballots. That equaled about 776 votes because there are two different ballot cards per voter. Voters were watching the recount behind cones and tape as sheriff’s deputies were nearby. The machine with the Precinct 93 sign was on the corner of the boundary, so it was one of the few machines where observers could see the tabulation tape, Shapiro said. . "There were a lot of volunteers who saw it and reported it to us," Shapiro said. The West campaign asked St. Lucie County canvassing board member Tod Mowery -- a county commissioner -- about the machine. "They told us Sunday that they used the Precinct 93 machine to run half of the ballots from Precinct 85 because it was such a large precinct," Shapiro said. "It still had the Precinct 93 sign on it. ... Because they didn’t change the sign it confused a lot of people." Mowery "took us over to the machine to show the tabulation tape. It did say Precinct 85 on it. It was Sunday at about 3 o’clock. I was standing right there and I was talking to him." Edson gave us this account in an email: "There was a machine that was mislabeled at the recount. When we looked at the tape for what we were told was Precinct 93, there were over 900 votes cast. It turned out that another precinct that had been counted on the same machine as 93. The matter was cleared up." We also interviewed Mowery, a registered Republican. Precinct 93 only had one early vote cast in this race, Mowery said. That’s why during the retabulation on Sunday, elections officials used the Precinct 93 machine to count a chunk of the ballots from Precinct 85, a much larger precinct. Mowery said that after a news conference on Nov. 18, the West campaign asked him about Precinct 93. Mowery said he printed out the long form from the machine, which showed that the machine was counting results from Precinct 85. "I took them over to the machine," Mowery said. "I showed them the actual receipt for the Precinct 85 tabulation data. They all agreed that was in fact the case." Mowery said he asked the West campaign if they had additional questions about the Precinct 93 machine and they didn’t. Before we give our ruling on this claim, we will wax nostalgic about our Allen West fact-checks. He claimed that about 80 of House Democrats are Communists and that he had higher security clearance than the president which we rated Pants on Fire. He also got a True rating for a claim about the number of people on Social Security Disability and a Mostly True for a claim about the cost of a missile. For those who follow West on PolitiFact, there could be more to come. The Georgia GOP is ready to welcome their native son with open arms, which could mean our sister site PolitiFact Georgia could land some West fact-checks. Our ruling A Palm Beach Post article paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson saying that, "Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered." The same claim was picked up by people on Facebook. It's not true. A machine that had the label of Precinct 93 was actually counting votes from another precinct. In the end, only six people voted in Precinct 93, which has seven total voters. We rate this claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-11-20T17:44:32	2012-11-20	['None']
pomt-02018	U.S. Reps. Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez were "touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/06/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-reps-eric-cantor-and-luis-guti/	Dave Brat recently brought some right-wing firepower to his campaign to unseat U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday. Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County’s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration. She noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served. Cantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That’s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez’s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor’s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary. Ingraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was "beautifully choreographed." She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring "Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s." Ingraham said of the two politicians, "They’re touring the country last year talking ‘How to Make Life Work’ -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform." The Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us. So we looked into Ingraham’s claim. Julia Hahn, Ingraham’s executive producer, said the radio personality was referring to a widely publicized "Becoming America Pilgrimage" held July 25-27, 2013. The event, organized by the non-profit Institute for Faith & Politics, took lawmakers to Ellis Island, the Museum of Jewish Heritage and other sites around New York City. A delegation of about 100 people, including House members, academics and faith leaders, traveled from Washington for the event. An article in Politico previewing the New York event said it wasn’t "meant to hash out the nitty-gritty of legislation or debate the politics of specific immigration policies. But lawmakers hope it will be small step forward in Congress’s effort to enact immigration reform." Gutierrez and Cantor attended parts of the three-day event. Cantor spoke at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights in Queens about the "special struggles that Jewish people had arriving in a country that often did not understand or welcome people of his faith and culture," according to a synopsis of his speech by the Faith & Politics Institute. Hahn pointed to a video of part of Cantor’s address on the conservative Breitbart.com website. It shows Cantor acknowledging Gutierrez in the audience and saying, "Luis, thank you for the leadership you’re providing through thick and thin right now as we try and navigate these very tough political times and choppy waters. My hat is off to you." Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor political adviser, said the majority leader’s recognition of Gutierrez was a simple courtesy. Allen was dismissive of Ingraham’s remarks. "No, Congressman Cantor did not tour the country with Congressman Gutierrez," Allen emailed. "No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate’s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan." Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor’s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage. Rivlin also said his office checked the congressman’s schedule and found Gutierrez "has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration." Rivlin also said that beyond the "Becoming America Pilgrimage," he’s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended. We asked Ingraham’s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty. Our ruling Ingraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were "touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform." Cantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that’s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration. One event in New York does not make a national tour. Ingraham can’t point to another immigration gig Cantor and Gutierrez both attended. Her likening the two politicians to Simon and Garfunkel "joined at the hip" on a tour to promote immigration reform is not only false, it’s ridiculous. We rate Ingraham’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-06507	"These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/ipab-board-15-bureaucrats-who-will-decide-nation-s/	At a debate in New Hampshire, Michele Bachmann was asked how to make sure that Medicare doesn’t waste money. "No one wants the government to come between a doctor and a patient. But do you think that Americans are getting the most for their money in Medicare spending?" asked Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty, one of the debate’s moderators. "And how can we make sure that the money that is being spent is being spent on the treatments and the preventive treatments that do the most?" Rather than answering the question directly, Bachmann pivoted to attacking President Barack Obama’s health care law. "I think that senior citizens across the country have no idea that President Obama plans for Medicare to collapse, and instead everyone will be pushed into Obamacare," Bachmann said. "And just like Newt Gingrich said, the way that Obamacare runs, there's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans. I don't want 15 political appointees to make a health care decision for a beautiful, fragile 85- year-old woman who should be making her own decision." We’re not sure what she means by when she says people will be pushed out of Medicare and into Obamacare. If what she means by "Obamacare" is the health care law, then the law assumes that Medicare will continue. In fact, the law made a number of changes to Medicare intended to make it operate more efficiently and provide better care. One of those changes was the creation of a board called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. Here, we’ll fact-check Bachmann’s claim that IPAB is "made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." We’ve looked at the board in some detail in a previous fact-check by PolitiFact Georgia. Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors. Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time, it will be automatically implemented. IPAB has many critics. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule the board’s recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, some members of Congress have attempted to repeal it. Getting back to Bachmann’s statement, she’s right that there are 15 members of the IPAB and that they are political appointees. But that leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements. The law states that the members "shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives." It also says the board "shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly." And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care "shall not" constitute a majority of the board’s members. The president appoints 12 of the 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate. Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment. The IPAB is forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. Bachmann said the IPAB "will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." It is possible that private health insurance companies might look at the IPAB’s recommendations for cost-savings and efficiency and try those ideas for their own customers. But legally, the IPAB only has the power to suggest changes to Medicare, which includes 47 million beneficiaries. Bachmann’s comments also give the impression that the IPAB makes decisions on individual cases. It does not. We looked at the claim that the board decides "whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy," and rated it False. Our ruling Bachmann said, "There's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." There is a board with 15 members, and most are appointed through a political process, though they must have expertise in health care. But the board is intended to recommend cost savings for the Medicare program. It would not "make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." We rate her statement False.

pomt-13573	Under Hillary Clinton’s plan "illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-crimin/	Donald Trump’s first TV ad of the general election depicts Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan as dangerous for America. "In Hillary Clinton’s America, the system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay," states the ad. "Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It’s more of the same, but worse. Donald Trump’s America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again." The narration is accompanied by sinister music and footage of men being apprehended by border agents while other shadowy men walk freely on public streets. We have previously fact-checked Trump’s claim that Clinton wants "totally open borders" and ruled that False. He is correct that she wants to allow more Syrian refugees in the United States. This fact-check will focus on whether Clinton supports allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country. There is some truth to his claim, but Trump’s scary ad omits an important part of the story. Clinton’s immigration plan: Deport violent criminals Clinton has not vowed to deport every undocumented immigrant convicted of a crime. But the ad creates a misleading impression that she will let every criminal stay, regardless of the crime. Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals. Clinton campaign spokesman Joshua Schwerin pointed to Clinton’s comments about her deportation priorities in a March debate in Miami, the National Immigrant Integration Conference and on her website. When pressed to explain her position during the debate, Clinton said she wants to limit deportations to "violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety." Clinton has proposed being more lenient than Obama: "So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority." She said violent criminals and those who plan terrorist attacks or threaten us are "a relatively small universe." We asked for more details about the types of crimes that would be included on her deportation list and did not get a reply from the campaign. But it’s fair to read into her statements that some criminals who committed lower-level crimes would be allowed to stay. That approach is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration. In 2014, a memo from the Homeland Security Department stated that the government would focus first on threats to national security, border security and public safety, including those involved or suspected of terrorism or felons. The second level of priority was for undocumented immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors (not including minor traffic offenses). That policy means that an estimated 87 percent of the undocumented population is not a priority for enforcement, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that examines immigration trends. "We do not know enough details about Mrs. Clinton’s plans to characterize who would get to stay or would be a priority for removal," said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the institute. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s clear that Clinton favors legalization for many undocumented immigrants but not for violent offenders. "Looking at Hillary’s statements, it’s clear that Trump’s ad is misleading," he said. "Many, but not all, unlawful immigrants committed criminal offenses, but they are usually not violent or property crimes. Instead those were crimes in the immigration statutes." The Trump campaign provided PolitiFact with information related to additional positions Clinton has taken that relate to undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes: 2013 immigration bill: Clinton supported the immigration bill that passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. The bill said that undocumented immigrants could apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, which allowed them to stay in the country if they met certain criteria including that they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. This fits in with Clinton’s plan to focus on violent criminals. Sanctuary cities: These policies generally refer to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. During her first race for president, Clinton said she would not crack down on sanctuary cities and argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. But Clinton doesn’t appear to want sanctuary cities to protect suspected murderers. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton’s view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety. Trump’s campaign also noted that thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been ordered removed and have criminal convictions remain in the country under Obama. We don’t know how the pace of criminal removals would differ under Clinton if she were elected. But the fact that Clinton has criticized the Obama administration for deportation has raised concerns among those who want to see stricter enforcement. "She has promised to expand upon Obama’s immigration policies," said David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which promotes more restrictive immigration laws. Our ruling Trump says "In Hillary Clinton’s America ... illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay." The tone of the ad is to scare voters into thinking that Clinton would welcome convicted criminals to remain in the country illegally, and that’s an exaggeration. Clinton has said that she will deport "violent criminals" as well as anyone who threatens our safety. She hasn’t been more specific about the types of crimes that would or would not lead to deportation.

"Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair," stated a Jan. 18 headline by The Patriot Report. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story has no evidence and is fake news. The story attributes the information to Ladies of Liberty, a website that describes itself as satire. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In May, Pelosi supported Mueller’s appointment as a "first step" but in October called for an "outside, fully independent investigation." The Patriot Report said that Pelosi and Mueller had a 13-year affair that will force Mueller to resign, but Pelosi will hold her California congressional seat until she dies. The story said that Pelosi said her husband was aware of the affair and that her "husband was afforded the same freedom to explore 'pleasures of the flesh.' " Pelosi has never made any such comment. Fictional affairs are common fodder on fake news websites. We previously debunked fake articles claiming that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, had an affair with former FBI Director James Comey, and that U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with a cheerleader. We rated both of those claims Pants on Fire. We sent a message to The Patriot Report on Facebook and did not get a reply. A headline said that "Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair."

pomt-00675	"We had the biggest drop of the rate of unemployment (in) all but 4 states."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/10/lincoln-chafee/lincoln-chafee-says-ri-governor-only-four-states-h/	Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went on CNN April 12 after announcing that he was thinking about running for president. CNN’s Dana Bash was ready for him. After some discussion about issues such as the second war in Iraq and the shrinking middle class, Bash noted that Chafee had left office after only one term with an approval rating of just 25 percent. Then she asked: "If you have that kind of low standing in your own state, how are you going to get support around the country?" Chafee talked about the "tough times" that Rhode Island faced when he took office. And he said "every little thing was difficult" as he attempted to turn Rhode Island around by, in part, doing unpopular things like raising taxes and hiking beach fees. "But, at the end, and that’s why I’m running, Rhode Island is better off," he said. "We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but four states. That’s a great record of accomplishment." We wondered if Rhode Island had experienced the "biggest drop of unemployment ... of all but four states" during Chafee's tenure. But first we had to pin down the time period he was referring to. Chafee’s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, told us that the time period was from January 2011, when Chafee took office, through February 2015, covering the most recent unemployment report at the time of the CNN interview. And she pointed us to the unemployment rates for those months. Rhode Island’s unemployment rate for January 2011 was 11.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate for February 2015, a preliminary number subject to change, was 6.3 percent when Chafee spoke. So the difference between the higher rate and the lower one – the way Rich indicated that Chafee chose to figure the change – is 4.9 percentage points. (He could have, and maybe should have, measured the improvement as a percentage, but we’ll get to that later.) So how did that drop of 4.9 percentage points compare with other states? Only three other states, not four, had a bigger percentage point drop during the same time period, according to the numbers on file at the bureau as of April 20. Two other states also had declines of 4.9 percentage points. So with that timeframe, Chafee would have been correct to say: "We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but three states." Ok, so Chafee was off a bit. But there's more than one way to gauge the drop in unemployment. Instead of looking at the percentage point drop, you can calculate and compare the change as a percentage. We asked URI economist Leonard Lardaro, a leading expert on the condition of the Rhode Island economy, which method was better. Lardaro says it is more legitimate to calculate and compare Rhode Island’s improvement as a percentage. That’s because Rhode Island had one of the highest unemployment rates to begin with, and therefore, improvements in percentage points are easier to come by. As a percentage, Rhode Island’s drop from 11.2 percent to 6.3 percent is an improvement of 44 percent. That's pretty good. But 12 other states did better. By that measure, Chafee was way off. During his appearance on CNN, Chafee didn't specify how he was calculating his statistic, leaving his statement open for interpretation. Calculated in percentage points, Rhode Island’s ranking was better than he said. Calculated as a percentage, it was worse. Because his statement contains some element of truth, if looked at one way, but falls apart if viewed in a different way, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04949	"I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-general-fund-budget-shrank-when-he-/	During a recent debate with Republican George Allen, Democrat Tim Kaine maintained that he is the true spending hawk in Virginia’s U.S. senate race. As proof, Kaine cited budget cuts he made as Virginia’s governor. "I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with," he said during a July 21 debate in Hot Springs. We decided to examine Kaine’s claim. The general fund supports public education, health programs and public safety. Most of its money comes from state incomes and sales taxes. When Kaine became governor in January 2006, he inherited a $15.1 billion general fund budget for the 2005-06 fiscal year that started the previous July 1. The economy was healthy at the start of Kaine’s term, and the fund stood at $17 billion during each of the next two budget years. Then Virginia, like the rest of the country, slid into recession and tax revenues plummeted. The general fund dropped to $16.2 billion during the budget year that started in July 2008. At the end of his term in January 2010, the general fund shrank to $14.8 billion. Before leaving office, Kaine proposed a farewell budget that kept the general fund at $14.8 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010. So the general fund decreased by $300 million -- or 2 percent -- from the start to the end of Kaine’s administration. Despite the reduction, the state was spending more money on general fund programs at the end of Kaine’s term than at the beginning. That’s because the state used federal stimulus money to support some general fund programs during the recession. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund. Virginia propped up general fund programs with $1.5 billion of stimulus money during fiscal 2009-10, and $1 billion of stimulus in 2010-11, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee. If those stimulus funds are combined with the budget figures, the state spent $16.3 billion on general fund programs during the 2009-10 budget that was in effect at the end of Kaine’s term. That translates to a 7.9 percent increase in general fund spending from the start to the end of Kaine’s term. Adjusted for inflation, total spending on general fund programs -- including stimulus money -- was essentially the same at the start and end of Kaine’s term. When the stimulus money ran out in 2012, the state began feeling the full brunt of budget cuts Kaine and the General Assembly approved. Under the six governors that preceded Kaine, the general fund budget grew by an average 33.8 percent -- not adjusted inflation -- from the day they came to office to the day they left. This figure does not include the spending levels each governor proposed in their budgets for the fiscal year that would begin six months after their terms ended. Our ruling Kaine said the general fund budget was smaller at the end of his gubernatorial term than at the start. The raw numbers hold up his claim: The general fund budget was $15.1 billion when Kaine took office and $14.8 billion when he left. These figures don’t include $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money the state used to support general fund programs during Kaine’s last year. But this does not detract from Kaine’s claim. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund, which mainly consists of income and sales tax revenues. And when the stimulus ran out, there was no backfill for the budget cuts Kaine endorsed. We rate Kaine’s statement True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2012-07-27T06:00:00	2012-07-21	['None']
pomt-04409	"Oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-oil-production-down-14-percent-ye/	President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sparred during the second presidential debate over drilling policy on federal lands. Romney said -- among other things -- that "oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land." That’s similar to a statement that PolitiFact Ohio checked last April-- "Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before." It’s also similar to a claim we checked a few weeks later, that oil "production's down where Obama's in charge." We’ll recap our analysis here. The 14 percent number We turned to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration titled, "Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011." To produce the report, EIA worked with the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells. While Romney said "this year," the most recent data available is from 2011, so that's what we'll use. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent. This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render the statement accurate. How reliable is it? But is the 14 percent figure cherry picked? Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. "From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend," he said. So we pulled the numbers from when George W. Bush was in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- as well as from when Obama was in office. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led. We note that: • From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent. • From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent. Fiscal year Offshore (million barrels) Onshore Total Percent change from prior year 2003 579 101 680 n/a 2004 572 97 669 -1.6% 2005 542 96 638 -4.6% 2006 471 101 572 -10.3% 2007 514 105 619 +8.2 2008 462 104 566 -8.6% 2009 527 105 632 +11.7% 2010 618 108 726 +14.9% 2011 514 112 626 - 13.8% Source: EIA; some numbers slightly off due to independent rounding in source data It’s also worth taking a closer look at what went into the overall number. From 2009 to 2010, oil production from offshore sources rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show. Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. Offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent. So the big story of the one-year dropoff in public production is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production— along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust. While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn’t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA. And President Richard Nixon ordered a moratorium in the wake of a 1969 well blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. "Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium," Hakes said. Who gets the credit or blame? It’s important to note that most big boosts in production, according to experts, follow years of earlier exploration and drilling -- efforts begun under the policies of prior administrations. By the same token, Obama’s actions in office should have an impact in the years to come. "I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can," said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. "If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did." The recent expansion of hydrofracking — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades. "That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles," Hakes said. "There are just too many factors." So, Obama certainly shouldn’t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush. Our ruling So: Did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year? Yes. But there’s nuance in the number. Production under Obama was hobbled due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making a one-year figure subject to cherry-picking. And it’s not at all clear that the president in charge when the oil is taken out of the ground deserves full credit or blame; years of prior policies on exploration and drilling had an impact. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-16T22:46:58	2012-10-16	['None']
pomt-06753	Says that before Rick Perry became governor, "only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job ... Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/24/mike-villarreal/mike-villarreal-says-texans-earning-minimum-wage-m/	Among Democrats vowing to critique Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s record, state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio swiped at his stewardship of the state’s economy. At an Aug. 6 rally outside the Texas Capitol, Villarreal first noted news stories on Perry’s "D" in an economics course at Texas A&M University. Perry’s college transcript was recently snagged by the left-leaning Huffington Post. "But you know," Villarreal said, "I have less concern about that ‘D’ than his record in the governor’s office. Before he took office, only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job, 4 percent. Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent." The latter statistic immediately rang a bell; The Austin American-Statesman noted in a July 17, 2011, news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work. The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. The story quotes Lori Taylor, associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributing the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living. To support his claim, Villarreal pointed us to a March 28, 2011, post by the Bureau of Labor Statistics titled "Minimum Wage Workers in Texas — 2010." The post says that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, compared with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work. And, he said, the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates. The post includes a graph plotting the state’s share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage from 1997 through 2010. Separately, regional bureau economist Cheryl Abbot sent us an easier-to-read breakdown showing that in 2000, which Perry mostly spent as lieutenant governor before being sworn in as governor, 5.8 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage—not the 4 percent aired by Villarreal, though. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, 4.2 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. According to the bureau, the share of Texas hourly workers in that category reached 4.5 percent in 2003, then dropped to 3 percent in 2006 before increasing each of the four subsequent years, reaching 9.5 percent in 2010. There’s a wrinkle in these percentage changes that we noted in a 2010 fact check. The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. For that article, Abbot told us that from 2006 to 2009, "just over 300,000 more Texans" entered the minimum-wage-or-less category. She said the bureau has "no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage." By email, Villarreal told us the wording of his rally statement was off. He said that if he’d said the percentage of hourly workers earning the minimum wage or less in Texas has doubled since Perry's first full year as governor, his "point would have been the same, the audience would have understood the same idea, and the statement wouldn't be snagged on any technicalities." Asked why the governor is responsible for changes in the state’s share of minimum-wage hourly workers, Villarreal replied that Perry has taken credit for job creation in the state, so all jobs should be taken into account. He said he offered the comparison in arguing that Perry has not led Texas "towards investing in the education and human capital needed to grow high-paying jobs." Our take: Villarreal’s statement wobbles in two important ways, first by saying the percentages apply to the total Texas labor force when they do not and second by understating the percentage of hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage before Perry became governor; it was 5.8 percent, not 4 percent, though the share dropped to 4.2 percent his first full year as governor.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday that President Barack Obama should be getting the European Union nations into line. "They’re dysfunctional political organization, Europe is," Graham said. "And without American leadership organizing Europe and the world, you see people like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who has an economy the size of Italy -- he’s playing a poker game with a pair of 2s and winning." Really? Russia is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas and the third-largest producer of oil, and it has an economy the size of Italy? Turns out they largely do. The numbers Russia and Italy are very close to each other in terms of nominal gross domestic product, which is the standard unit used to measure the size of a country’s economy. Nominal GDP is the total cost of all goods and services produced or sold in a country in within a certain time frame. Russia’s 2013 nominal GDP was $2.1 trillion, and Italy’s was $2.07 trillion, according to the World Bank. That’s not the only way to measure a country’s economy, of course, and this is where the two countries differ. Purchasing power parity takes nominal GDP a step further and shows the value of this level of economic activity if it took place in America. (The Economist explains it by showing how much a McDonald’s Big Mac costs around the world.) Russia’s GDP calculated for purchasing power parity was $3.5 trillion, while Italy’s was $2.1 trillion. So in 2013, Russia had a higher level of economic activity than Italy, but because goods and services are more expensive in Italy, the overall value (nominal GDP) ended up the same. Also, Italy has more wealth relative to the size of its population than Russia does. Italy’s 2013 GDP per capita (per person) was $34,619, and Russia’s was $14,612. But nominal GDP is the standard way to measure an economy’s size compared to other nations, and Graham got that right. Russia’s influence Though Russia may have an economy the size of Italy’s, that hardly means it's too small to throw its weight around. Russia ranks eighth among the world’s top 10 economies, based on 2013 nominal GDP: United States -- $16.8 trillion; China -- $9.2 trillion; Japan -- $4.9 trillion; Germany -- $3.6 trillion; France -- $2.7 trillion; United Kingdom -- $2.5 trillion; Brazil -- $2.2 trillion; Russia -- $2.1 trillion; Italy -- $2.1 trillion; India -- $1.9 trillion. Also of note: the European Union’s 2013 nominal GDP was $17.4 trillion. Graham compared Russia’s economy to Italy’s to show how small it is -- but Italy’s economy isn’t that small compared to the rest of the world, so neither is Russia’s. In terms of level of economic activity -- purchasing power parity -- Russia is No. 6 in the world. In fact, their spot on the list today is close to what it was in the last couple years of the Cold War (the earliest data the World Bank has on Russia’s GDP). In 1992, the year the Soviet Union officially dismantled, their nominal GDP was ranked ninth in the world (America was No. 1). The Russians were also ninth in 1991 and 1990, and they were eighth in 1989. Russia’s economic standing among other countries has been on the rise in recent years. Only in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has Russia’s nominal GDP been in the top 10. One likely reason for their growth is rising oil prices, which have quadrupled since 2002. Oil and natural gas make up nearly 70 percent of Russia’s exports. (Though this isn’t to say the rest of Russia’s economy is thriving.) Although some say Russia’s overwhelming dependence on oil won’t sustain them for long, Russia has used this natural resource to gain leverage in the Ukrainian conflict -- such as cutting off a major gas supply to Ukraine. And the origins of the conflict lie in whether Ukraine should strengthen its ties with Russia or the European Union -- proving that Russia still exerts a strong influence over some countries’ economic activity. Our ruling Graham said Russia "has an economy the size of Italy." In terms of nominal GDP, Graham is correct. But if you run the numbers a different way and measure purchasing power parity, Russia's economy is larger than Italy's. Graham's statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-04607	"The president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion debt."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/19/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-engaged-spending-binge-ran/	When the Treasury Department announced on Sept. 4 that the national debt had topped $16 trillion, the Associated Press reported, Barack Obama's GOP rivals "used the grim-but-expected news to criticize the president for the government's fiscal performance over his 3 1/2 years in office." Among the leaders who issued news releases was House Speaker John Boehner. Instead of working to cut the deficit, the Ohio Republican said, "the president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt." PolitiFact Ohio was interested. Does spending under Obama break down to a $50,000-per-person share of the national debt? We asked Boehner's office for more information. They responded that the speaker "has often talked about President Obama’s stimulus-fueled spending binge" and called it "a reference to his entire approach to economic policy, not just one bill ... "It's the strategy Obama has pursued since taking office: spend more, refuse to make cuts and reforms where needed because, he argues, such cuts and reforms would hurt the economy. Under his presidency," Boehner’s staff said, "our national debt has increased by $5 trillion and has brought the total share in debt for every American to $50,000. We would not have reached that level of debt on September 4th without the contribution of his economic policies." The cost per person is accurate, and even a little understated. With population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau at roughly 314.4 million, the average share works out to about $50,900. The national debt has risen more than $5.4 trillion from its level of $10.6 trillion when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. But can that all be tied to Obama's spending? It’s a question we’ve addressed before. In May, PolitiFact looked at historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculated the average spending increases per year for 10 presidents over the past 60 years (skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure). Using raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation), Obama oversaw the lowest annual increases of spending among them. Jimmy Carter had the highest, followed by Richard Nixon. PolitiFact also did a recalculation because of the special case of 2009, which came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. The 2009 fiscal year began four months before Obama moved into the White House, and its major spending decisions were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress. The recalculation shifted spending from Bush to Obama for the economic stimulus package, an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, an incremental increase in appropriations over Bush's level and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. That shift moved Obama from last place in spending increases to either second from the bottom or third from the bottom. Using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase in average annual spending. In fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. (Lyndon Johnson was highest on that chart; Dwight Eisenhower was lowest.) So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown? First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows. Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending. Finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- commonly called the stimulus -- sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans. FactCheck.org found the spending Obama inherited "was so high that even modest increases keep it at a level that is extraordinarily lofty by historical standards." As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the nation's economic production, spending is running at the highest level since the 1940s. But tax revenues are also low by historical standards, FactCheck.org found, and are at their lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1950. Boehner’s claim included an accurate estimate of what the national debt of $16 trillion would cost per person. But his claim stated that as a result of a presidential "stimulus-fueled spending binge" every American man, woman, and child" was stuck with a $50,000 share of the $16 trillion debt. That’s an overreach. The debt grew to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses. The stimulus package came with a $787 billion price tag. If you include all growth in the national debt under the Obama administration, it’s roughly $5.4 trillion, not $16 trillion. The administration inherited a national debt of more than $10 trillion when it came into office. But Boehner’s claim saddles the administration with responsibility for all of the $16 trillion. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner’s claim rates False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-09-19T06:00:00	2012-09-04	['United_States']
pomt-00864	There was "just about zero press coverage" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/juan-williams/media-reaction-george-w-bushs-email-controversy/	Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didn’t mind when President George W. Bush’s White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The show’s March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clinton’s decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn’t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. "When Karl was in trouble back in ‘07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue," Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. "Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you," Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the time and how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S. attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accounts set up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didn’t cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was "zero press coverage" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include "Republican National Committee" and "email" within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Let’s compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include "Clinton" and "email." We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. That’s several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. It’s a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clinton’s use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams’ reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clinton’s private email use. Not the same Williams’ argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because they’re worried about Clinton’s 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. There’s some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, there’s the difference in who’s at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. What’s more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As one Washington Post article put it: "The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings." Our ruling Williams said there was "just about zero press coverage" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was "zero press coverage" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton’s use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08446	John Kitzhaber created 128,000 new jobs while governor.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/16/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-claims-credit-oregon-jobs-when-he-w/	Politicians of all stripes love to tout the number of jobs they have created. Current Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski talks about his transportation funding packages that have resulted in new roads while putting people to work. President Barack Obama talks up stimulus spending. John Kitzhaber -- the former emergency room doctor best known for health care reform and salmon restoration -- is no different. In public statements, responses and campaign mailers, Kitzhaber states he is the only candidate with a record of creating jobs for Oregon. Sometimes he says that 128,000 jobs "were created" during his 1995-2002 reign. Other times he takes active ownership, saying that "we created over 125,000 jobs." In any case, the implication is clear: He was responsible for Oregon’s heady growth during his governorship. And here PolitiFact Oregon thought the national dot-com frenzy of the 1990s had powered Oregon’s go-go decade. Anyway, we decided to find out more, noting that previously, PolitiFact Oregon had rated Chris Dudley, the Republican in the race, Half True for blaming Kitzhaber for the economic woes that slammed Oregon at the end of his tenure. First, the numbers. The Kitzhaber campaign cites the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up its claim of 128,000 new jobs. A review of the data shows the campaign is actually lowballing the figure. Nearly 128,000 more people were working in December 2002 than in January 1995, but the number of jobs added over the time period was closer to 179,000. Either way you count it -- workers or jobs -- there was growth. But how much of it was Kitzhaber's doing? He says a lot. "During my two terms as governor, we created over 125,000 jobs in Oregon; wages rose by 49 percent and our state gross annual product rose by 48 percent," he wrote in July. "This did not happen by chance. It resulted from a series of intentional decisions based on the recognition that while government doesn't create jobs, it can help create the climate in which job growth can occur. The repeal of the unitary tax; the reform of Oregon's workers' compensation system; the establishment of the Strategic Investment Program; the many trade delegations I led to Asia, Europe and Mexico; the investment we made in rural infrastructure — all laid the foundation for the dramatic economic growth Oregon experienced in the 1990s." Let’s break down some of those claims. Kitzhaber was in the state Senate in 1984, but it was then-Gov. Vic Atiyeh who led the charge to repeal the unitary tax. Before that, multinational corporations could be taxed on sales outside Oregon, discouraging them from setting up in the state. Kitzhaber was not in office when state lawmakers approved the Strategic Investment Program in 1993, and in fact it was then-Gov. Barbara Roberts who pushed the program, which provides a cap on business property taxes, after losing a multibillion-dollar Intel plant to New Mexico. Over the years, the program helped land biotech company Genentech, LSI Logic and another Intel expansion in Hillsboro. A 1995 story by The Oregonian noted that the state that year "attracted more semiconductor investment than any other state." Kitzhaber played a large role in the 1990 fight to reform Oregon’s costly workers’ compensation system. He was senate president at the time and helped pass landmark legislation lowering the high cost of Oregon’s system. Neil Goldschmidt was governor and Kulongoski was insurance commissioner at the time. Low and predictable rates are good for business. Finally, it’s true Kitzhaber went on at least five overseas trade missions, mostly to Asia, while in the governor’s office. He was in office in 1996 when Delta Air Lines announced the launch of the first-ever direct flight from Portland to Europe (Frankfurt, with a hopscotch stop in Cincinnati). And he also championed investment in rural Oregon, with money to upgrade sewer and water systems and to dredge the Columbia River. Kitzhaber campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene also added that in 1995 he helped push an ambitious $750 million transportation package, which included a nice chunk for light rail in Portland. In 2002, Kitzhaber started the Oregon Business Plan, a framework still used by business today to get behind a common agenda, such as money for bridges and roads and investments in nanotechnology. "He gives credit where credit is due when he talks about it. In the ‘80s and through the ‘90s there was a series of intentional decisions made that made our state very attractive to business," she said. "He was part of that." But economists agree that the 1990s were just plain strong around the country. In Washington County, Intel eventually led a surge of chip and wafer makers in former farmland west of Portland. Part of the growth had to do with global demand for products; part of the business decisions to settle in Oregon had to do with tax incentives. "There's no question employment went up during that time period," said John Mitchell, a former economist with U.S. Bank who owns a consulting company in Portland. Tom Potiowsky, who has been state economist since 1999, said the Strategic Investment Program probably helped. But, he added, "you’re going to have a lot of other things involved, too. You need to have, what’s your transportation look like? What’s your work force like? You have to have some synergy going for you." How much Kitzhaber was responsible for that synergy or in laying the groundwork for economic growth is hard to say. "An awful lot of what happens in Oregon is driven by global and national trends. So that’s probably the biggest overlay," said John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest. "However, the governor is responsible for setting a tone and building a foundation and climate that is ... a favorable business climate." The state must have been doing something right, since personal income per capita grew faster than the U.S. average from the late 1980s to 1997. But after that, the pace cooled. "A lot of the activity in Washington County either slowed down or fell, and we didn’t have anything to replace it with," Tapogna said. As the earlier Oregon Truth-O-Meter ruling notes, in 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s. When Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent. It’s true that overall, there was a 13 percent growth in jobs over his eight-year term, but the number of jobs actually began to decline after December 2000. The bottom line is that Kitzhaber didn’t have to focus too much on job growth or ponder budget cuts for the bulk of his administration. Oregon had scads of money. Just about every state added jobs and workers from 1995 through 2002. In the west, Washington added 319,400 jobs, a nearly 14 percent increase; Colorado, 372,200 jobs, a nearly 21 percent increase; California nearly 2.2 million jobs, or 18 percent increase. Idaho added 103,900 jobs, a 22 percent increase. The economy was not a central concern for most of his administration. Kitzhaber played a role in making Oregon more attractive to business, but the global and national economies played a larger role in Oregon’s success. The fact of increased jobs in his claim is accurate but by trying to take credit for jobs creation, he leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06624	One Wisconsin school district "is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/19/al-sharpton/rev-al-sharpton-says-wisconsin-gov-walkers-budget-/	Schoolchildren in America’s Dairyland going without milk? Blame Gov. Scott Walker, the Rev. Al Sharpton says. Sharpton, a civil rights activist and former Democratic candidate for president, is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and, since August 2011, permanent host of MSNBC’s "Politics Nation." On Sept. 7, 2011, as part of a segment of "calling out" Republicans for acts of "injustice," Sharpton attacked Wisconsin’s first-term governor. "Governor Scott Walker’s budget cuts mean some kids are going without," Sharpton declared. "One school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time." Walker has prided himself as a budget cutter; his 2011-2013 spending plan reduced state funding of schools by nearly $800 million. But did mere fear of state budget cuts leave some Wisconsin schoolchildren without milk to go with their graham crackers? We called and emailed MSNBC and the National Action Network, Sharpton’s Harlem-based civil rights organization, asking for evidence to back up Sharpton’s statement. Neither responded. But we found that the day before Sharpton’s program aired, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison carried an article about milk for schoolchildren in Baraboo, which is about an hour northwest of the state capital. The newspaper article said the Baraboo School District "decided to end its practice of providing milk with students' morning snack this year, citing concerns the state might eliminate subsidies for the program." Sharpton wasn’t the only one to jump on the news. The article was posted on the website of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers union. The liberal Daily Kos blog, which has a national following, carried an article of its own. And "Fabulous Farm Babe" Pam Jahnke, who does a daily agribusiness report on Wisconsin radio stations, posted a poll question about the issue on her website. To sort out whether Sharpton’s characterization of the situation was accurate, we interviewed Crystal Ritzenthaler, the school district’s superintendent; Kevin Vodak, the school board president; and Doug Mering, the board vice president. All three said school administrators did eliminate milk during morning snack for elementary school students in the 2011-2012 school year. But they said Walker’s state budget cuts had little, if anything, to do with the decision, which Ritzenthaler, the superintendent, said was made in spring 2011 while Walker’s budget was being debated. The three Baraboo officials said that, for more than a year, the school district’s Wellness Committee had discussed milk being served during snack time and that the decision to eliminate the milk was recommended by the committee. Ritzenthaler told us milk during snack was eliminated for a number of reasons: 1. Concern that children were consuming too much milk -- one half-pint carton during breakfast at school, another during morning snack and a third at lunch. There was a concern that the milk reduced the kids’ appetite for lunch, plus the school board wants to promote the drinking of water, which has been substituted for milk at snack time. 2. Concern about the amount of milk wasted because many children drank only a portion of the carton. 3. Administrative time needed to track how much milk was being consumed. Ritzenthaler said less important factors were the $10,400 the school district spent on milk for snack time in 2010-2011 -- and the fact that figure likely was to increase because Walker’s budget cut 10 percent from the state’s funding of the program. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie confirmed the 10 percent cut. The same set of reasons was cited in a May 25, 2011 email from Baraboo schools administrator and principal Molly Fitzgerald informing her fellow elementary school principals that milk at snack time would be eliminated. The email added that state funding for the program "may be eliminated anyway in the state budget." Vodak, the school board president, was emphatic that budgetary considerations played little or no role in the decision to stop serving milk during snack time. He said he believed administrators cited cost as one of the reasons to eliminate the program only "as an afterthought" in explaining the decision. So, is that the final word on why Baraboo kids aren’t drinking milk at snack time? Not quite. Although the May 2011 email from Fitzgerald to principals emphasized non-budgetary reasons for eliminating milk at snack time, she gave a different response when interviewed by the local newspaper for an article Sept. 2. The program was eliminated "due to concerns the state might eliminate" its funding, the Baraboo News-Republic quoted Fitzgerald as saying. News of the decision in early September troubled the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, so Laura Wilford, director of the board’s Wisconsin Dairy Council, contacted Baraboo school officials. She said she was told cost was the major reason for eliminating the program and that school officials were concerned about the condition of the Baraboo schools budget as well as cuts in state funding. Ritzenthaler said the Baraboo paper didn’t accurately report Fitzgerald’s comments and that Fitzgerald has tried to clarify to the dairy council the non-budget reasons for eliminating milk at snack time. We also asked Ritzenthaler for copies of minutes of recent meetings of the school district’s Wellness Committee, which Baraboo officials said had discussed the milk at snack program for a year or two. But she said the discussions aren’t reflected in the minutes. OK, it’s almost break time. In criticizing Walker, Sharpton said "one school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time." Baraboo school officials now say state budget cuts had little or nothing to do with the decision to stop providing milk at snack time, but previously some of them indicated that fear of state budget cuts was the main reason.

pomt-03123	An average of seven children in America are killed by guns every day.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/18/mayors-against-illegal-guns/group-uses-kid-gun-deaths-demand-tougher-laws/	There’s little that is more tragic than the death of a child. One group recently attempted to use those emotions to sway a prominent Georgia lawmaker to its side in the national gun legislation debate. Mayors Against Illegal Guns sent backpacks to the Atlanta office of U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss that were filled with postcards calling on him to support "comprehensive, life-saving background checks on all commercial gun sales." "[S]even backpacks will be dropped to represent the seven children and young people who are murdered with guns every day in America," the Mayors Against Illegal Guns news release reads. "Every day, 33 Americans are murdered with guns in America — and seven of those are children." PolitiFact Georgia read about this on the website Georgia Unfiltered and wondered whether Mayors Against Illegal Guns was correct about how many children were shot and killed every day in America. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was co-founded in 2006 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. The coalition wants legislation passed that would require background checks on all gun sales. It claims more than 1,000 members across political party lines. Georgia mayors in the organization include Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, Roswell’s Jere Wood and Earnestine Pittman of East Point. The coalition has been pressuring senators such as Chambliss who’ve either been on the fence or against gun bills it supports. Chambliss voted against a gun-control measure earlier this year. That amendment would have allowed a vote on a measure to require nearly all gun buyers to undergo background checks. The coalition said it based its claim on data from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also noted that other organizations, such as the Children’s Defense Fund, have touted similar numbers. In July, the Children’s Defense Fund released a report that found 2,694 children and teens were killed by guns in 2010. That’s an average of 7.4 deaths a day. Raymonde Charles, a spokeswoman for the CDF, said it began compiling such data on its own 20 years ago and noted it refers to this age group as "children and teens" to reflect that its data include 18- and 19-year-olds. Here’s a chart the mayors coalition shared with PolitiFact: Year Gun homicides 0-20 Gun deaths 0-20 2006 2,813 4,064 2007 2,725 3,871 2008 2,597 3,777 2009 2,352 3,539 2010 2,308 3,459 Average 2,559 3,742 Per day 7.0 10.3 We looked at the CDC site and did a search for how many people 18 and under were killed in homicides by guns in each of those years. The numbers do not include suicides. A CDC spokesman confirmed that is the best way to research such information. Here were the totals: 2006: 1,629 2007: 1,568 2008: 1,486 2009: 1,359 2010: 1,260 That’s a total of 7,302 deaths, an average of four a day. Yes, we included the extra day in 2008 for our calculation. An average of four children killed by homicides from guns a day is troubling, but it is substantially less than seven a day. We asked the coalition why it decided to use those 20 and younger for its claim as opposed to 18 and under. Some may not consider anyone older than 16 a child, since that’s the age most states allow someone to get a driver’s license or get married (with parental consent). The coalition said it included victims under 21 because they cannot legally buy firearms or possess a gun in some states. "The unfortunate reality is that the most recent CDC research shows that we lose seven children - not yet twenty one years old - to gun violence every day in America," Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. "These are young people - treated as minors under many of our laws - who won't see their twenty-first birthday because Congress won't pass the common-sense laws that a big majority of parents are calling for." To sum up, Mayors Against Illegal Guns said in a news release to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, in an effort to encourage him to support legislation that the group believes would keep firearms out of the wrong hands, that seven children are killed by guns every day. The coalition should have been more specific by saying it was referring to people under the age of 21. We believe that information would add significant context for those who may not believe anyone older than 16 or 18 is a child. The Children’s Defense Fund was more specific, noting its total included children and teenagers. The coalition’s claim is accurate, but it omits some important details. Under our rating system, the statement is Half True.	None	Mayors Against Illegal Guns	None	None	None	2013-09-18T06:00:00	2013-09-12	['United_States']
pomt-14395	Says Donald Trump and Marco Rubio opposed Cruz’s "efforts to defund Planned Parenthood."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-levels-flawed-claim-about-donald-trump-op/	In a TV ad, conservative pastor James Dobson tells viewers that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has the support of thousands of likeminded pastors thanks to his unwavering support for "the sanctity of human life and traditional marriage." In the ad, which Cruz’s campaign mostly ran in Iowa in advance of the 2016 presidential caucuses, Dobsonthen turns his attention to others vying for the Republican presidential nod. "After Donald Trump and Marco Rubio announced they would accept the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage, we knew we could not support them," Dobson said. Dobson goes on: "Our decision was confirmed when they," Trump and Rubio, "opposed Senator Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood." His gay marriage comment rang a bell. Rubio, the Florida senator, and Trump, the New York businessman, each called the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage the law of the land while Cruz insisted in June 2015 that states not singled out in the ruling didn’t have to comply, which we found Mostly False. We focused on Dobson’s closing claim: Did Rubio and Trump each oppose Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood? This seemed unlikely. Republican efforts to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, limited already to family planning and non-abortion health services, gained steam last summer when videos secretly shot by an anti-abortion group purported to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit, a conclusion that hasn’t factually borne out. Cruz’s efforts extended to a failed September 2015 attempt to stop Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan to fund the government unless, Cruz said, Congress amended the agreement in a way that would defund Planned Parenthood. This ad first aired in November 2015 and then throughout December and January leading up to the Iowa caucuses. A version captured in video online by the Political TV Ad Archive, however, shows Dobson mentioning Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, as a reason for GOP voters to elect Cruz. We checked with Internet Archive, the database that manages these ads, on how that could be possible. According to the Television Archive’s managing editor, Nancy Watzman, the Scalia mention was most likely added to the original ad, before this version began airing after the justice’s death Feb. 13, 2016. Asked about the basis of the Rubio-Trump claim, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that "Trump has said he’s against defunding Planned Parenthood, and Rubio missed the votes to defund Planned Parenthood." Where was Marco? According to news accounts, Rubio indeed missed two votes on defunding Planned Parenthood, both of which Rubio called "show votes." Rubio was at a Florida campaign fundraiser at the time of a Sept. 28, 2015, cloture vote on McConnell’s plan to fund the government. He then missed a Sept. 30, 2015, vote on final passage of that plan. News stories and Senate records otherwise indicate that from August 2015 through December 2015, the Senate voted at least five times on defunding Planned Parenthood. Set aside the votes Rubio missed, the records show, and Rubio and Cruz each voted three times to defund. Yet we didn’t spot any instance of Rubio opposing defunding, though that judgment doesn’t take into account Rubio’s absence from the Senate the day that all but one Republican colleague of Cruz didn’t go along with the Texan’s move to reject McConnell’s government funding plan until it defunded Planned Parenthood. Cruz's September song In September 2015, Cruz was one of the last hold-outs on McConnell’s government funding plan, which included an extension of Planned Parenthood funding. In one of his last moves protesting the funding bill, Cruz called for -- and failed to get -- a roll call vote or a voice vote to register Republicans’ positions on the final plan. Cruz said later that denying him the vote was a way for his colleagues to avoid accountability. Republicans in the Senate, Politico reported, loudly yelled "no" when Cruz called for a voice vote, a resounding rejection for what was described as typically an uncomplicated procedural matter. The only Senate colleague to back Cruz in his last-ditch effort was Mike Lee of Utah. This all took place on Sept. 28, 2015, when Rubio was absent, and shortly before the funding bill was finalized, which kept the government running and eliminated the possibility of defunding Planned Parenthood in the immediate future. Rubio camp's response Cruz has attacked Rubio’s record on this matter before. At the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University Feb. 12, 2016, Cruz told voters that Rubio didn’t want to use Congress’ "constitutional authority to defund Planned Parenthood," Politico reported, quoting Cruz saying: "Marco Rubio has spoken out about Planned Parenthood. But when these videos came out I stood with millions of Americans calling on Republican leadership to use the power of Congress to defund Planned Parenthood and to cut off the money. And Marco stood up and said: 'No, we shouldn't.’" At the time, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told Politico that Cruz was "making things up." On the other hand, a Sept. 17, 2015, Politico news story said Rubio had refused to sign a letter circulated by Cruz urging McConnell not to advance government funding without an end to Planned Parenthood aid. In a Sept. 27, 2015 interview with NPR News, Rubio said he wouldn’t "prefer to see it (the government) shut down." He said, "I don't think there is any single organization in the country that's worth shutting the government down over," but he also laid the blame for a potential shutdown on Democrats for insisting on funding Planned Parenthood. When we asked the Rubio campaign about the claim in the Cruz ad, spokesman Jahan Wilcox sent a press release the campaign initially distributed Feb. 12, 2016, the day of Cruz’s speech at Bob Jones University. The release said Rubio has cosponsored legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and has "always" voted to do so. The Rubio release offered specific votes: Rubio’s Dec. 3, 2015, vote to defund Planned Parenthood in a reconciliation bill, his Sept. 24, 2015 vote for a funding bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, his Aug. 3, 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and his co-sponsorship of that bill. Anti-abortion group We also reached out to National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, to seek its perspective on Cruz’s claims. (The group hasn’t endorsed a presidential candidate.) By email, we fielded a comment from its president, Carol Tobias, saying Rubio had voted to defund Planned Parenthood even before Cruz joined the Senate; she pointed out a roll call on H. Con. Res. 36, April 14, 2011. Tobias also said that since Cruz joined the Senate in 2013, "both he and Sen. Rubio have voted the same on every roll call that National Right to Life regards as pertinent to defunding Planned Parenthood. To suggest that Sen. Rubio voted wrong or missed meaningful votes on the Planned Parenthood issue is inaccurate and misleading." Trump supported Cruz's push at first As for Trump, National Right to Life pointed out his lack of a congressional voting record. We asked Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, about Cruz’s claim. Hicks said by email: "Mr. Trump has always stated he will defund" Planned Parenthood "as long as abortions are taking place, but believes the women's health services like cancer screenings for cervical and breast cancers are essential to millions of women across the country." That seems to represent the progression of Trump’s position on the matter. As well documented, Trump favored abortion rights earlier in his life. At the first GOP presidential debate Aug. 6, 2015, Trump said he had had a change of heart after a friend decided not to get an abortion, and he saw that child grow up. News stories show that in August 2015, Trump supported Cruz’s unsuccessful push to shut down the government unless Congress defunded Planned Parenthood. But Trump shortly backtracked, saying he would look at the "good aspects" of the organization. And in October 2015, Trump told Fox News he wouldn’t shut down the government over Planned Parenthood though he also said the organization should "absolutely be defunded." On Meet the Press Feb. 21, 2016, Trump said he wouldn’t fund Planned Parenthood "as long as they’re doing abortions." In the same interview he said that his friends, who are women, "understand Planned Parenthood better" than he ever would. At the Feb. 25, 2016 Republican presidential debate, Trump said: "Millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly," but that he also "wouldn’t fund it." Our ruling Dobson said in Cruz’s ad that Trump and Rubio opposed Cruz’s "efforts to defund Planned Parenthood." In the narrowest way, you could say Rubio opposed Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood by expressing misgivings about holding the government hostage to funding of a particular organization. But that's also misleading. Rubio, like Cruz, otherwise repeatedly voted to defund. Trump, meantime, expressed support at the time for Cruz’s efforts. He later reversed course on that but he's been clear lately about wishing to defund so long as the group provides abortions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08740	Michael Thurmond "authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia’s senior citizens and working families."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/31/michael-thurmond/thurmond-claims-legislation-helped-low-income-geor/	Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, calls it the most important legislation he has written. Back in 1990, when Thurmond was a state representative, he proposed a bill to give a tax credit to Georgians with annual incomes of less than $20,000. Then-Gov. Zell Miller announced his support for the idea a year later, and it became Georgia law shortly thereafter. Thurmond, the Democratic Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 2 general election, boasted about the bill's impact on his campaign website. He is running against incumbent Johnny Isakson, a Republican, and Libertarian Party candidate Chuck Donovan. "Thurmond authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia’s senior citizens and working families," his campaign bio says. But is that true? Did Thurmond write the legislation, and did it save Georgians that much money? AJC PolitiFact Georgia was curious. We first called Thurmond, who was eager to talk about the statement. Thurmond said his legislation was written to help offset the sales taxes low-income Georgians pay for groceries. Miller was part of a push in the late 1980s to remove groceries from Georgia's 4 percent sales tax. Thurmond offered his suggestion as a compromise. Miller initially opposed Thurmond's idea. But Miller eventually endorsed the plan after being told his idea was not financially viable, particularly since state finances were struggling. Miller said he was "swallowing his pride of authorship." The refunds in question were relatively small -- they ranged between $5 and $26. Thurmond said the refunds may seem puny to some, but he argued they were a big help to many recipients. "For a senior citizen, that might be dinner for a week," Thurmond said of $26. Thurmond's desire to discuss the claim stems from a successful effort earlier this year to repeal the key portion of his legislation. State lawmakers added language to a bill on the next to last day of this year's session that ends the refunds. Gov. Sonny Perdue signed the bill on June 4. Thurmond argues his legislation has helped senior citizens and low-income Georgians. He equates ending the refunds to a tax increase. "I just don't believe we need to be raising taxes in the midst of a recession, particularly on low-income people," Thurmond said in an interview. State Rep. David Knight, R-Griffin, was the lead sponsor of the effort to repeal the refunds. "People who have paid in no income tax and have zero tax liability are in essence getting a check back," Knight told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in April about the current system. "If you pay no income taxes, how can you get a refund? How can you justify someone getting a check back from the state? That is, in its purest form, taking away from the taxpayer and giving to someone who has no tax liability. [It's] a redistribution of wealth." Thurmond argues the sales tax has a greater proportional impact on the wallets of low-income Georgians. Sarah Beth Guhl, deputy director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, explained Thurmond's point in an e-mail. "Low-income families consume more of their income, and thus pay the sales tax on a larger portion of their earnings," said Guhl, who agreed with Thurmond that a sales tax is regressive on low-income Georgians. Thurmond admitted an error in his statement the first time we talked to him. The legislation provided about $300.3 million in tax relief over the span of 13 years, according to the most recent Georgia Department of Revenue data available. Thurmond sold himself short by about $50 million. "It lacks the truth in a positive direction," Thurmond said in a telephone interview. The Thurmond campaign came to the $250 million total using data available on the Revenue Department's website. The data comes from the department's annual statistical reports. The reports on the Revenue Department's Web site, however, only go back to 2000. The Revenue Department has reports that date to 1997 with annual low-income credit figures in its north DeKalb County offices. But Thurmond's website gives him some serious wiggle room by saying "more than $250 million in tax relief." We rate his statement as True.

pomt-02088	"Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, … living longer on average, and facing less income inequality."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-united-states-falling-behind-/	The next presidential election may still be two and a half years away, but the presumptive Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is all over the news. On May 16, 2014, in a speech at the New America Foundation, a moderate-to-liberal think tank, Clinton compared the United States and Canada on several measures of well-being. Clinton found the United States wanting. "Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States," Clinton said. "They are working fewer hours for more pay, enjoying a stronger safety net, living longer on average, and facing less income inequality." We’ll set aside the claim about the safety net, since that’s tricky to measure statistically. But the other claims are ripe for a closer look. So we’ll take them in order. (Clinton’s camp did not respond to our inquiry.) Canadian middle-class incomes are now higher than in the United States This is the trickiest of the measurements Clinton mentioned, for a couple reasons. First, there’s no universally recognized definition of "middle class" in the available data. Second, there’s more than one way to measure the data. Some measurements take a nation’s economic output as a whole and divide it by the population, whereas others sample individual people or households to find out how much they make, then find the midpoint. Clinton has support from New York Times article that looked at data from the Luxembourg Income Study database, which is based on surveys going back 35 years. The study surveyed people in various countries, asked them what they earned, then used a median to determine the mid-range income level. The New York Times concluded that "median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then," due to studies conducted by other groups since 2010 suggest that pay in Canada has risen faster than pay in the United States. On the other hand, if you look at gross domestic product per capita -- the total amount of economic activity divided by population -- the United States tops Canada, and not by a trivial amount. In 2012, GDP per capita in the United States was $51,689, compared to $41,559 for Canada, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (These figures, as with all other money figures in this article, have been converted to U.S. dollars, so that they can be compared.) But this method has drawbacks. Because it represents an average across the entire economy, the final results tend to over-represent the income that flows to the wealthy. So it’s not ideal for measuring "the middle class." Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo, and Ross Burkhart, co-director of the Canadian Studies Program at Boise State University, told PolitiFact that using the Luxembourg Income Study is at least as good a measurement for Clinton’s claim as the other figures, if not better. They are working fewer hours for more pay than Americans OECD data for the average number of hours worked annually per employed person shows that Clinton is correct. In the United States in 2012, workers spent 1,790 hours per year on the job, compared to 1,710 hours per year in Canada. One could say that Americans are working harder and producing more goods and services, but Clinton’s point was that Canadians have greater opportunities for leisure, and on that point, the statistics support her point. As for getting more pay, OECD statistics for 2012 show that the average annual wages for workers in Canada were $58,376, compared to $55,048 in the United States. This measures the average wages earned by a full-time, full-year employee. These statistics support Clinton’s claim. Canadians are living longer OECD data for life expectancy at birth shows that in 2011, Canadians could expect to live 81 years, while in 2009, the most recent year available, Americans could expect to live 78.7 years. So Clinton’s right on this one, too. There’s less income inequality in Canada The primary statistic used for gauging income inequality is the "Gini coefficient." Gini coefficients range from 0, or perfect equality, to 1, or perfect inequality. According to the OECD, the Gini coefficient for Canada in 2010 was .320, compared to .380 in the United States. That means Canada is modestly more equal than the United States is, which is what Clinton had claimed. Overall, the five comparisons Clinton made are reasonable and aren’t cherry-picked or subject to statistical quirks, Burkhart said. "It's fair, in my understanding of the Canadian and U.S. economies, for Ms. Clinton to make the kinds of comparisons that Ms. Clinton has made," Burkhart said. Our ruling Clinton said that "Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, … living longer on average, and facing less income inequality." She’s indisputably correct on four of these five measures, and the data is more mixed on the fifth. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-06738	Public-employee unions spent $30 million in Wisconsin unsuccessfully trying to flip the state Senate to Democratic control.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/28/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chairman-reince-prie/	In a round of interviews following the Wisconsin Senate recall elections, the Republican Party’s national chairman framed the results as a clear victory for Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans lost two seats but retained Senate control, despite a major -- and expensive -- effort from Democrats and their supporters. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown on Aug. 18, 2011 that the results show Walker shouldn’t worry about the left trying to recall him in 2012. He argued voters stood with Walker in the face of the challenge by public employee unions outraged over his changes that curtailed collective bargaining for most government workers. And he put a number on the union’s effort. "I don’t think he should be worried at all, and if the public employee unions want to flush another $30 million down the toilet, and then allow Scott Walker to be even stronger and win a recall election … then they should go ahead and do it, because the $30 million they flushed down the toilet will be $30 million they don’t have for other races. So, hey, go for it." Thirty million -- that’s a pile of money. Especially if that’s just what unions spent on the races. An RNC spokesman told us Priebus -- the former Wisconsin GOP chairman -- actually was referring not just to labor unions, but to any spending on the pro-Democrat side. "Analysis from our political folks in Wisconsin suggests that when all is said and done, pro-Democrat groups will have spent between $20 (million) and $30 million on their failed effort to win a majority in the state Senate," said Ryan Mahoney of the RNC. Of course, Priebus on MSNBC limited his claim to the public unions -- and said a flat $30 million. So there are already problems with his claim. We’ll focus on what Priebus said on MSNBC, but also take a quick look at spending by both sides. Asked for backup for his claim, the RNC sent us dozens of links to media accounts of the disclosed spending in the recalls. Priebus, like reporters, based his arithmetic on what is publicly known about spending in the nine races. That’s notable. Under state and federal laws, millions of dollars in campaign spending by various political groups goes unreported, but Priebus isn’t suggesting he has inside information about that. He’s citing the information that is publicly released. That -- and a decision by labor groups to collectively work through a political action committee, We Are Wisconsin, that has to publicly account for its spending -- makes our math easier. A coalition of national, state and local labor groups funded most of the activities of We Are Wisconsin. The national AFL-CIO was most prominent, followed by various teachers unions; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Service Employees International Union, and many others. We Are Wisconsin was by far the major player on the pro-Democrat side, spending nearly $10.8 million through election day, according to official figures reported to the state. Several teachers unions and miscellaneous small unions separately spent about $1 million more. So that’s a total of about $11.8 million, far short of $30 million. Let’s look at this another way, and compare our numbers with those of other organizations that track campaign spending. We looked at links between We Are Wisconsin and other major liberal groups active in the election. If you stretch the union label to include groups that got direct financial support from We Are Wisconsin, you could count at least another $2.2 million. So that would get you to $14 million in union-linked money. Meanwhile, two organizations have produced comprehensive scorecards of left vs. right spending in the nine recall contests. They base their numbers on official campaign reports filed with the state Government Accountability Board. The John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Wisconsin, produced an elaborate flow chart of pro-Dem spending – including unions but also "national and state liberal groups." MacIver’s definition, then, was broader than Priebus’ "union" claim. Still, its total tops out at about $15.2 million, or roughly half of what Priebus claimed. The most prominent campaign-spending tracker is the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in campaign spending. It’s allied with a coalition of left-leaning groups, including several unions. Its total for pro-Democrat spending by groups: $15.1 million. Again, $15 million is far short of $30 million. None of these figures include spending by the candidates themselves. The candidate spending was dwarfed by the outside groups, but still amounted to about $2.5 million by all the Democrats in the recall elections, according to our tabulations of reports filed with the state Accountability Board. So, even if you include candidate spending -- which Priebus didn’t -- the pro-Dem total is only about $17.6 million. That’s the pro-Dem side. What about the pro-GOP side? Looking just at the publicly disclosed money, Republican candidates and pro-GOP groups spent about $3.5 million compared to the $17.6 million on the other side, according to official figures compiled by the Democracy Campaign. That’s a big mismatch -- but there’s a big caveat. Several prominent pro-Republican groups -- including the biggest player on that side, the Wisconsin Club for Growth -- were set up in way that doesn’t require disclosure of millions of dollars in spending on TV ads and other activities. To a much lesser extent, pro-Democrat groups did the same. The Democracy Campaign estimates that undisclosed spending by groups could equal the publicly reported figures. But that’s an educated guess at amounts of undisclosed spending. The bottom line: Nobody really knows how the undisclosed numbers break down. So we -- and Priebus -- were left with the publicly reported numbers. Priebus claimed public-employee unions poured $30 million into the state Senate recalls in Wisconsin. But the publicly disclosed spending reports that he cites -- by our account as well as groups affiliated with the left and right -- put total spending by pro-Democrat groups at $15 million or less. And that includes campaigning by liberal groups not connected to unions. Based on available information, even if he meant to say all pro-Democratic spending he was way off. We rate his claim False.

pomt-14085	Says Demond Means, "turnaround district" superintendent for Milwaukee Public Schools, said the district "needs to be gutted."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/18/wisconsin-jobs-now/debunking-claim-demond-means-said-milwaukee-public/	The Milwaukee education community is paying close attention to Demond Means, superintendent of the so-called "turnaround district" for Milwaukee Public Schools. The position is the result of the Opportunity Schools and Partnership Program, created by the Republican-controlled state Legislature. The measure directed Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele to appoint a special commissioner with the power to take over a limited number of low performing MPS schools. Some, including the teachers’ union, see Means as leading a de facto takeover of MPS, which could mean the replacement of school leaders, lost jobs for teachers, even the closing of schools. In November 2015, Abele selected Means, superintendent of the Mequon-Thiensville School District, as the special commissioner, a part-time post for which both say he is not currently being paid. On April 21, 2016, Means laid out his initial plan for the Milwaukee School Board. Under his plan, specific schools -- which have not yet been chosen -- would be transferred to the opportunity schools district, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. Students would remain part of MPS, and teachers and staff would keep their jobs and benefits as district employees. MPS board members would retain "many of their statutory powers" under state law. But the plan also calls for the creation of an "independent, autonomous school governing body" at each school. Those bodies would take part in the budget process, and interview and make recommendations on principal appointments. Opponents, including Wisconsin Jobs Now pushed back. The liberal group posted a picture of Means on Facebook on April 28, 2016. The image showed Means holding a sign that read "MPS needs to be gutted!" Unlike a meme, which typically makes clear the message is fake, the Facebook post included this note: "Abele's MPS Takeover Czar Demond Means really said this." Whoa. Did Means really say that? In a word: No. At least there is no hard evidence of it, nor does not track with his public statements and actions. And when we asked Wisconsin Jobs Now Executive Director Martha De La Rosa about the image, she acknowledged the image was a "photoshopped picture." But she argued it conveys what the group believes are Means’ intentions. The original photo actually comes from the 2016 edition of Stritch Magazine, published by Cardinal Stritch University. Means is among a group of alumni profiled. Like the others, he is pictured holding a card with his "personal mission statement." His statement: "My mission is to close the gap for all students." That’s a far cry from the statement used in the Wisconsin Jobs Now post. When we asked DeRosa about the words it attributed to Means, De La Rosa said they came from a private conversation that two people had with Means. "It’s from a credible source -- actually two people say he made that comment," De La Rosa said. OK. But who? "Unfortunately, I can’t say who," De La Rosa said, adding that "the setting was over some drinks at a bar. He thought he was talking with some people who were on his side." As for any additional evidence, De La Rosa simply offered that she feels the image conveys the intentions of Means and others supporting the Opportunity Schools program. "Look at what he’s putting forward," she said. "You can see where it is going." The record so far To the contrary. Public statements by Means and Abele on the topic have been measured, with Abele stressing that he did not seek the appointment authority and stating he wants the turnaround provisions to be carried out in a targeted manner. In January, a month after he was appointed to his position, Means notified MPS that he had no interest in taking over vacant or underused school district buildings -- a symbolic gesture that was intended to assure the district he is not plotting a "takeover." "That was a very important moment in establishing trust and demonstrating that we mean everything we say when we say we want to help Milwaukee Public Schools," Means said in January. "Our intent is to help the schools of Milwaukee." In an interview, Means said he was bothered by the Facebook post. "It is diametrically opposed to the work that I’ve continued to dedicate my career for," he said. "I want to make sure that I help MPS, not hurt MPS." Means said that he didn’t make the statement attributed to him by Wisconsin Jobs Now. "I just don’t use that type of language," he said. "That is the opposite of how we are approaching the work." Our rating A group opposing the "turnaround" program for MPS posted a photo of Demond Means with a statement that says "MPS needs to be gutted." But Means says he never said those words, the group offers no real evidence he did and acknowledges the photo was doctored to make their point. Indeed, the original words on the photo conveyed a message of helping public schools, not gutting them. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11929	"There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/13/colin-jost/colin-jost-weekend-update-texas-dildos-law-6-own-m/	Saying individual Americans should own fewer guns, a co-host of the news-like Weekend Update segment on NBC’s "Saturday Night Live" wrapped in a claim about Texas. Colin Jost, who also wondered aloud about the mass shooter in Las Vegas owning 47 guns, said in the Oct. 7, 2017 episode: "No one should own 47 of anything." Cats, for instance, Jost went on, before adding: "There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why—no one needs that many! If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful." Cue laughter. But does Texas have such a law? An NBC spokeswoman, Lauren Roseman, declined to comment when we sought the basis of Jost’s statement. We similarly failed to draw comment--about Jost's accuracy--from the Texas attorney general’s office, law professors and representatives of Texas law officers and district attorneys. A law found unconstitutional For our part, we suspected that Jost was referring to a state law restricting "obscene devices" that remains in place despite being found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court nearly a decade ago. We recently looked into the law, which dates to the 1970s, in finding Mostly False a claim that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, once supported a ban on sex toys. Cruz’s defense of the law, we concluded, came as part of his duties as the state’s top appellate lawyer at the time. Section 43.23 of the Texas penal code does not specify dildos. It states: "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device." Another provision specifies: "A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same," the implication being that the person would violate the restriction on promoting such devices. In ruling against the state in February 2008, judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, in violation of the 14th Amendment. State lawyers did not appeal the dildo ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. "Just as in Lawrence," the circuit court judges wrote, "the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence." Law remains in place Lawyers familiar with the appeals court ruling agreed, when we asked, that the sexual devices statute remains in Texas law — but that’s an empty reality, most said. James C. Todd, a since-retired Texas assistant attorney general who defended the law in federal district court, said by phone he wasn’t surprised that legislators haven’t acted to repeal the law. His speculation: "They don’t want to go back and in the next election have it said (that) my opponent voted against a law to prohibit indecency." Todd said that while the law remains on the books, it’s unenforceable; since it’s declared unconstitutional, no prosecutor would prosecute someone for violating it, he said. Gary Krupkin, a Dallas lawyer who represents vendors of sex toys, said by email that the circuit court’s ruling had the same effect as the Texas Legislature repealing the law. Krupkin said he’s unaware of any other state law that could be used to ban, restrict, or otherwise impede the purchase, ownership, commercial sale or use of multiple dildos. Former judge suggests legal limbo We should otherwise note a legal twist explored by PolitiFact Florida in 2015. In 2008, a Texas state appeals judge upheld a conviction stemming from the sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi. The majority opinion upholding the Texas law was issued months after the federal circuit court had found it unconstitutional. In 2015, legal experts commented on this contrast by saying that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs still would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court. In the July 2008 state appeals court ruling, Linda Reyna Yañez, a judge on the 13th District Court of Appeals covering Brownsville north to Wharton, wrote that though the court embraced the circuit court’s ruling against the law’s constitutionality, it wasn’t required to follow it. Yañez wrote: "Fifth Circuit precedent is not binding on Texas courts." The judge also wrote that because the state’s chief criminal appeals court earlier held that the same law didn’t violate due-process rights, the state appeals court had no binding basis to hold otherwise. In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to "stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose." At our request, Yañez, an Edinburg attorney who’s no longer a member of the appeals court, re-read the ruling in October 2017. Next, she told us by phone that she stands by the conclusion despite her personal backing of the circuit court’s ruling. "I remember," she said, "not being able to do what I really wanted to do," which would have been to find the law at fault, she said. But because the U.S. Supreme Court hadn’t taken up the law’s constitutionality while the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously upheld it, she said, "I had absolutely no choice." "Theoretically a law enforcement officer could still arrest somebody" for violating the law, Yañez said. "This is the way it works. Sometimes you have these inconsistencies and people are left in limbo." Todd later agreed by phone that it’s a rule of judicial decision-making that Texas appeals courts follow the highest state court’s ruling even on a matter of federal constitutionality. Then again, Todd said, "I’ve always felt like they’re not going to ignore what the 5th Circuit says." Krupkin said by email that we’d have to check every Texas county to cement whether anyone has been prosecuted under the law. "However, there is a very small cadre of attorneys that specialize in dildo defense. As part of that group, I have not heard of any prosecutions," Krupkin said. Our ruling Jost said: "There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos." Such a cap on "obscene devices" has been state law since the 1970s though it’s worth clarifying that the law mostly hasn’t been enforced since federal appeals judges found it unconstitutional in 2008.

pomt-04318	"We’re talking right now about a $12 billion hole in our current, so-called balanced" state "budget."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/29/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-so-called-balanced-state-budget-/	Can a balanced budget also have gaping holes? So suggested state Rep. Donna Howard, who told an East Austin meetup organized by Texans for Obama in August 2012: "We’re talking right now about a $12 billion hole in our current, so-called balanced (state) budget." The Austin Democrat’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, later told us that the declared hole lies in lawmakers last year not covering the full projected 2012-13 costs of Medicaid and public schools while also diverting billions of dollars from special dedicated funds to balance the books. Specifically, he said, the 2012-13 budget does not cover some $5 billion in projected Medicaid costs, defers a regular school payment of about $2 billion and diverts about $5 billion that was supposed to be dedicated to particular programs to balance the $173.5 billion budget. About $4.9 billion was diverted from dedicated accounts to balance the budget, according to a September 2011 report by the comptroller’s office, though it’s not a novel tactic. We previously rated as Mostly True a November 2010 claim by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, that the 2009 Legislature had diverted $3.5 billion in dedicated funds to make the 2010-11 budget look balanced. Howard’s other figures hold up, we learned, though there were twists after the budget passed into law. The cost of a postponed distribution of school aid, put off to the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2013, has been ratcheted down from an initial $2.3 billion estimate to $1.9 billion due to changes in enrollment growth, according to information from the advisory Legislative Budget Board. And while the budget’s Medicaid under-funded amount was initially pegged at $4.3 billion, Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that pending agency budget requests reveal that the Texas demand on Medicaid, the jointly federal-state-funded insurance program serving low-income families, will be higher in 2013 than originally estimated. She said increased caseloads and costs drive up the under-funding to $5 billion. Rolling up these adjusted figures gets us to $11.8 billion, close to Howard’s $12 billion. DeLuna Castro and other close observers of state spending -- John Kennedy of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Chuck DeVore of the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation — did not quibble with Howard’s building blocks. Then again, Kennedy suggested that only the cited Medicaid amount must be covered before services are sought. That’s because Medicaid is an entitlement program; states must serve qualified applicants. If lawmakers wanted to do so, DeLuna Castro separately countered, they could fail to cover all the funding gaps, though she said that would have negative effects. For instance, she speculated, lawmakers could dramatically cut nursing home reimbursements rates by 30 percent, which she said would prompt nearly every benefiting nursing home to shut down, touching off client lawsuits. "Politically, there is a need for health care and schools," DeLuna Castro said. We were curious if schools or Medicaid already have been hindered by the budget decisions singled out by Howard. Not so, relevant agencies said. Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us by phone that Medicaid recipients haven’t been affected by the Medicaid IOU because the state’s matching money has yet to run out. She speculated the 2013 Legislature would cover the funding gap in time to maintain the state’s Medicaid commitments. Education agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email that school districts have not been battered by the deferred state payment partly because officials have been cognizant of the payment delay since mid-2011. "We have long advised districts to have sufficient (local) fund balances to manage through times when cash is tight. We would certainly hope that districts can manage a two-week delay without causing significant financial distress," Ratcliffe said. DeVore of the public policy foundation posited another wrinkle. Along with any shortfalls in the budget, he said, it’s relevant to consider what many expect to be a projected revenue surplus when lawmakers write the next budget. That is, holes can be filled -- and soon. The state treasury has accumulated revenue thanks to larger-than-expected receipts from sales, oil and gas production taxes. State Comptroller Susan Combs said in September 2012 that through the previous month, the state had reaped $3.7 billion more in tax revenue than earlier projected, on top of a previous unexpected surge of $1.6 billion, according to a Sept. 12, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article. Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, then commented he would not be surprised if lawmakers convening to write the next budget in 2013 are told the state faces a record revenue surplus. The established high-water mark is the $8.8 billion surplus reported at the end of 2007, Craymer said. On top of the better-than-expected revenues forecast, there is the rainy day fund -- the state savings account that can be used to close budget gaps. The comptroller estimated in fiscal year 2011 that the rainy day fund contained $8.2 billion and would contain $9.4 billion in fiscal year 2013. Our ruling Donna Howard says the current "so-called balanced" state budget has a $12 billion hole. Lawmakers did not cover all projected state costs of Medicaid in 2013 and put off a regular payment to school districts. As before, too, portions of funds intended for special purposes were set aside to balance the budget. On the other hand, school districts have not been slammed by the deferral and the agency overseeing Medicaid doesn’t expect consequences to eligible Texans unless lawmakers unexpectedly fail to cover costs during the 2013 legislative session. Besides, billions in unallocated projected revenue could help the next Legislature meet funding needs. Howard’s "hole" traces to funding shortfalls in the latest budget. But that budget still was balanced. We rate this claim as Half True.	None	Donna Howard	None	None	None	2012-10-29T06:00:00	2012-08-30	['None']
pomt-00691	I "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/may/05/van-taylor/van-taylor-says-texas-senate-sent-largest-tax-cut-/	First-term state Sen. Van Taylor recently credited the Texas Senate with advancing a record tax cut. The Plano Republican’s March 25, 2015, press release, said he’d "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate," providing $4.6 billion in property and business tax relief. Taylor was among more than 20 Senate primary authors of Senate Bill 1, which with voter approval would amend the state’s mandatory homestead property tax exemption, which has been $15,000 since 1997. If adopted, the new variable exemption, equal to 25 percent of the statewide median home value, was predicted to save homeowners $206 on average in 2016 and $233 on average in 2017. Two other measures, each authored by more than 20 senators (including Taylor), reduced the state’s business franchise tax rate by 15 percent and exempted an additional 61,000 small businesses from it. Tax-cut history has been ballyhooed in Texas before. State leaders in the 1990s and again in 2006 declared history in the works when they drove down school property taxes — even though the homeowners who were supposed to benefit didn’t always notice reductions because school districts and other local governing bodies still raised tax rates and reaped more due to escalating property values. Stumping for president in fall 1999, then-Gov. George W. Bush ran TV ads in Iowa saying he’d "signed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history." In 1997, lawmakers had proposed and voters approved the new $15,000 homestead exemption, up from $5,000 before. The two-year cost to the state of that move was pegged at $1.04 billion, according to a January 2015 report by the state comptroller’s office covering tax changes since 1972. In 1999, lawmakers funded local school property tax relief at a state cost of $1.4 billion in 2000-01, the report said. A billion here, a billion there, those reductions had far short of the projected two-year effect of the plans saluted by Taylor. 2006: $14 billion in relief Then again, in May 2006, the Republican-led Legislature and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to what was then touted as more than $6 billion a year in school property tax relief to be partly offset by revisions in the state’s business franchise tax, a $1-per-pack hike in cigarette taxes and tighter tax-reporting requirements for buyers of used cars. According to a May 2006 Austin American-Statesman news story, homeowners would benefit from the legislated one-third cut in maximum property tax rates for school operations. The owner of a $100,000 home was in for annual savings of about $145 starting in fall 2006 with the savings rising to $425 in fall 2007, the story said, though savings would be lessened if school boards inched up tax rates. On full implementation, the relief was projected to cost the state $14 billion every two years, according to a Legislative Budget Board chart published in 2012. So, the 2006 tax changes whomped the 1997 and 1999 cuts by the yardstick of projected state costs biennium by biennium. And, it appears, that $14 billion in intended relief also exceeded the $4.6 billion in relief predicted due to the Senate-passed proposals that Taylor described as record-setting. Taylor’s analysis We asked Taylor how he reached his conclusion. To our inquiry, Lonnie Dietz, Taylor’s chief of staff, said by email that Taylor relied on the comptroller’s 2015 report on tax changes since 1972 to gauge the legislated actions of 1997, 1999 and 2006. According to the report, Dietz noted, the school tax-rate cuts ordered in 2006 were projected to cost the state $3.9 billion through August 2007 and another $18.8 billion the next 24 months, money that would make up for lost local revenues due to the mandated rate cuts. Then again, the report said, the tax hikes approved to help fund those costs were predicted to generate more than $8 billion in the same period--making the 2006 actions a tax swap, not a pure cut, Dietz told us. Another thing: Dietz pointed out the lasting effect of the 2006 tax-rate action was to slow rather than reverse property tax increases. In 2008, a business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, compared 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the legislated rate cut. The difference amounted to about $7 billion, it said. "The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the group said. Separately, the Texas Education Agency offered data to us in 2010 showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were down 30.2 percent in 2007 compared with what the state projected they would have been without the rate cuts. Then again, taxpayers don't typically compare their tax bills to what they might have paid but to what they actually paid last time. And why didn't school taxes fall more between 2005 and 2007? At the time, Dale Craymer, TTARA’s president, gave two major reasons. The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul giving school boards the option of raising the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts. The second, most powerful factor, Craymer said, was rising property values. If values rise proportionately more than tax rates are cut, savings are negated and tax bills go up. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. Dietz also suggested we set aside property tax relief for comparative purposes because such taxes are locally set. If you do set aside property tax actions, he said, it’s clear the Senate’s 2015 measures shrinking the business franchise tax alone--SB 7 and SB 8--have a two-year savings to businesses of nearly $2.48 billion, according to legislative fiscal notes. "So on its surface right there no other state tax cut in the history of Texas even approaches what the Senate passed with SB 7 and SB 8," Dietz wrote. The comptroller’s report lists about 10 instances of lawmakers revising the franchise tax from 1975 through 2013 including some expansions and hikes. There also were attempts to cut the tax or reduce who pays; none of those actions were projected to cut more state revenue from the franchise tax than the proposals celebrated by Taylor. Other views As we analyzed the senator’s statement, other questions arose. For instance: Biggest tax cut in history for whom? And: Biggest tax cut based on the impact over two years--or longer? The school property-tax reduction adopted in 1997, for instance, surely has cost the state much more than its initial two-year price tag. On the other hand, it doesn’t seem fair to compare many years of accumulated costs (and savings to homeowners) to the two-year expected impact of the latest Senate moves. We gathered other views. By email and telephone, Vance Ginn, an economist for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, and Chris Bryan, spokesman for State Comptroller Glenn Hegar, each said the Senate-supported measures amount to the largest potential tax cuts in Texas history. Ginn stressed the 2006 school tax actions provided tax relief--stopping short of keeping taxes down. Like Dietz, he pointed out a chart in a December 2014 report by the state comptroller’s office indicating total school property tax collections decreased $2 billion in 2007 compared to the year before, but such taxes went up in 2008 and also increased all but one subsequent year through 2013. A school finance expert We shared Ginn’s message about total school property tax collections bouncing up after going down for just one year after the 2006 changes with school lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency finance official. Wisnoski commented by email: "Come back in a year, and I would imagine the same could be said about the Senate’s property tax cut of 2015." He further speculated that likely increases in property values will outpace projected savings from the Senate plan (see his calculations here) leading him to predict no reduction in overall school property taxes levied for tax year 2015. "That is not to say that the additional exemption" for homesteads in the Senate plan "is trivial," Wisnoski wrote, "and I would never characterize it as anything other than a tax cut. But I don’t believe it to" be "larger than the 2006 rate reduction." The 2006 law, he wrote, ultimately reduced school maintenance and operation rates by at least 22 percent; the maximum allowed M&O rate is lately $1.17 per $100 valuation, he said, compared to the $1.50 per $100 valuation in 2006. And district rates are even lower in some districts, Wisnoski indicated. Even factoring in districts that impose the state’s maximum debt-related tax rate of another $0.50 per $100 valuation, he wrote, the lingering percentage rate reduction would remain around 16.5 percent. Footnote: Weeks after Taylor made his claim, Texas House members approved proposed cuts in sales and business franchise taxes projected to cost the state $4.9 billion ($300 million more than the Senate’s plans) over two years--about $2.3 billion from shaving the state sales tax rate and nearly $2.6 billion from shrinking the franchise tax. The legislative session ends June 1, 2015. Our ruling Taylor said he "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the state Senate." Senate-approved proposals reducing the business franchise tax promise a record slash in that tax. But together, the Senate measures reducing franchise and property taxes by about $4.6 billion over two years, what Taylor highlighted, add up to less tax relief than the school property tax-rate reductions legislated in 2006, which cost the state $14 billion every two years. Homeowners might not notice those changes partly due to escalating values. Still, the state-imposed ceiling on school operations tax rates remains 22 percent lower than what was in place before.

pomt-02798	"The administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place (on Iran)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/03/bob-corker/corker-said-congress-dragged-obama-kicking-and-scr/	The tentative nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration has met with wariness in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties press for tougher sanctions. Just hours after President Barack Obama announced the deal with Iran on Nov. 24, 2013, Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed skepticism on Fox News Sunday. Among other things, Corker told host Chris Wallace that it was Congress, not Obama, that had pushed for the tough sanctions that forced Iran to the negotiating table. "Congress is what brought us here," he said. "The administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place." Corker’s comments turned out to be a GOP talking point. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., told CNN the administration "opposed the Senate putting the key oil sanctions on Iran," while Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., also told CNN that "the president opposed the first round of sanctions." Is that the way it happened? Deal or no deal First, a quick explanation of the new deal. Iran has already surpassed enrichment levels necessary for nuclear power, leading the world to believe it is pursuing a weapon. The country has faced sanctions from the United States since 1979, with additional sanctions in recent decades by the United Nations and the European Union. A deal reached last month in Geneva between the U.S., Iran and five other world powers would open the door to easing those sanctions. It’s a complicated arrangement, but in exchange for easing some sanctions, Iran will agree to scale back or completely halt its nuclear weapons program. Under the deal, uranium that has been enriched beyond levels necessary for nuclear energy must be diluted or converted, and the country may continue to seek nuclear technologies for power. Iran must also open up its nuclear sites to frequent monitoring and inspections from the U.S. and United Nations. So far, Iran has already made enough progress that it would take just one or two months to reach weapons-grade enrichment levels if it wanted. The new deal would add weeks to that time frame. In exchange, Iran would receive between $6 billion and $7 billion in sanctions relief, more than half from oil revenue that’s currently frozen in foreign banks. The agreement is temporary and only lasts for six months. At that time, U.S. officials say the sanctions could be put back in place if Iran reneges on its side of the bargain. Corker’s comments What Corker said sounded a lot like a statement made by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in the 2012 vice presidential debate: "This administration has no credibility on this issue (Iran). It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress." At the time, we rated the statement Mostly False. And gave the same rating to similar comments made by Romney earlier in the presidential cycle. We asked Corker’s staff for evidence to back his claim, and they sent us a handful of articles from 2011 and 2012 that highlighted the tension between the White House and Congress on the best path to pressuring Iran to drop its nuclear weapons program. An article from Foreign Policy dated December 2011 noted that Obama had angered Democratic allies by coming out against a Senate compromise his administration had asked for. But a day later, the administration sang a different tune after the bill passed the Senate 100-0, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Despite its initial misgivings, the administration came to see the bill as useful in pressuring Iran, and came to support it "so as not to damage U.S. relations with partner countries," the CRS report said. The last bit is a key point and is a big reason why we gave Ryan a Mostly False in 2012. There has been frequent tension between Congress and the White House on how to proceed with Iran. Both have eyed tough sanctions, and under Obama the U.S. has in place the "most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world," according to the Congressional Research Service. In fact, after three decades of sanctions, the U.S. has reached a point where there’s little left to ban going into and out of Iran. So it has instead sought to punish companies and countries that do business with Iran. But while Congress has pushed forward with a unilateral crackdown, Obama has asked for the flexibility to negotiate. In some instances, it would appear he used executive orders and signing statements to water down Congress’ attempts to pass tough sanctions. But when we looked at this question in 2012, a number of Iran experts told us that such episodes do not necessarily mean that Obama was showing weakness. Rather, it allowed him to negotiate with the European Union and countries like China to increase international pressure on Iran. Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact last year that "flexibility is the watchword. … It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran." At the time, James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said the back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch is common, and while some may call Obama’s maneuvers as "watering down," others counter that they actually strengthened the U.S. position. For this article, we checked back with Jeffrey to see if he held the same opinion. He did. "The Obama administration has supported tougher sanctions against Iran consistently," Jeffrey said. "But on this or any other issue it will push for maximum flexibility with the Congress. Thanks to that pushing, it got authority to waive or suspend sanctions based on either countries' reducing oil imports, or a presidential national security waiver — not yet used, but probably necessary to uphold the ‘First Step’ (Geneva) agreement. Without — repeat — without these modifications, to the initial congressional effort, it would have been much more difficult to mobilize the international community." Our ruling Corker said that on Iran sanctions, "the administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place." Experts agree that the term "kicking and screaming" is a large exaggeration. There was wrangling between the executive and legislative branches to secure negotiating flexibility for Obama — flexibility that made it possible to get the international community on board with tougher sanctions. Corker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Bob Corker	None	None	None	2013-12-03T13:49:43	2013-11-24	['Iran']

(S. 744 passed the Senate, with Cruz voting no, but wasn’t taken up in the House.) But in criticizing the original bill, Cruz noted a failing that would have special resonance today. "The bill expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks," Cruz said. We checked a very similar assertion Cruz made in December during a GOP debate in Las Vegas. His case was thin then and remains so today. The Cruz campaign did not respond for a request for comment. In December, Cruz was a bit more absolute. He said the bill gave Obama "blanket authority" without "mandating any background checks whatsoever." In Windham, he said it expanded the president’s authority without "mandating any meaningful" background checks. The most recent version is more nuanced, but still inaccurate. The heart of the assertion is that the immigration bill would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless. That designation would identify people who had no country to which the United States could send them. If refugees fleeing Syria were called stateless, the argument was that they could be admitted without vetting. David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, told us in December that the immigration bill specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. The "stateless" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. She explained that only people who are already in the country would face this situation. Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a "well founded fear of persecution." Our expert sources said Section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making individuals prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. The bill’s aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. "It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States," Bier said. "They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants." The experts we reached all agreed that the immigration bill required background checks for refugees and to the extent that it gave the administration more flexibility, that leeway applied to people already in the country, not those seeking to get in. Our ruling Cruz said the failed immigration bill "expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks." The key flaw with that assertion is the bill still required background checks for refugees. While there can be some debate over what constitutes a "meaningful" background check, the experts we reached said nothing would have directly changed the quality of the vetting performed on people attempting to enter the country. We rate this claim False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-02-03T14:19:33	2016-02-02	['Syria', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06735	"The estimated savings of this (debt ceiling) deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/29/bobby-scott/scott-says-debt-limit-deal-pays-half-bush-tax-cuts/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month. He said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions. "The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade," Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release. Do the savings in the debt deaI come to half the price of keeping the Bush tax cuts? We decided to check. First some background. The deal passed by Congress earlier this month expanded the nation’s debt limit to $16.4 trillion -- a $2.1 trillion increase the will give the federal government enough money to pay its bills until early 2013. The measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years in order to meet or exceed the size of the debt ceiling increase. The deal calls for $900 billion in cuts up front. A recently appointed bipartisan deficit reduction panel is charged with finding an additional $1.5 trillion that could come from spending cuts and revenue hikes, though House Republicans could still block any move to increase taxes. If the committee deadlocks, there’s a trigger in the legislation that would enact $1.2 trillion of cuts to domestic and defense spending. So the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could as much as $2.4 trillion. Scott, in a phone interview, said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. Jason Peuquest, a policy analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Scott is justified in using the lower figure. "It seems the $2.1 (trillion) is what people are focusing on most because the goal of the super committee is backed up by this automatic trigger," he said. Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. He said there is "at least an even chance" that the deficit panel will not reach an agreement, forcing the total of $2.1 trillion in spending reductions. The Bush tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire in 2010. Congress, at the end of last year, extended them through 2012. Scott pointed us to Congressional Budget Office reports that say the total cost of keeping the tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion. Of that amount, $3.3 trillion comes from lost revenues and the cost of interest payments needed to service the additional debt caused by the tax relief. The remaining $600 billion is the cost of maintaining adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Bush tax cuts required many Americans who had once itemized their returns to pay the more expensive AMT. As a result, about 20 million Americans lost part or all of the benefits of the tax relief. Congress came to their aid by increasing AMT exemptions. Three analysts said it’s legitimate to lump together the expense of extending Bush tax cuts for 10 years with the costs related to increasing the Alternative Minimum Tax exemptions. "Back when the (initial Bush) tax cuts were in play, a lot of people thought they wouldn’t be given any of the benefits of the tax cuts because more people would be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax," Peuquet said. So let’s sum this up. Scott says spending cuts required by the recent debt-limit deal pay half the cost of maintaining the Bush tax cuts through 2020. Scott figures $2.1 trillion in spending reductions will result from the agreement. That’s the smallest amount of cuts Congress is required to make under the deal, but it’s a widely-used number because its set in stone. The CBO says the total cost of extending the Bush tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion. That means the spending cuts would equal 53.8 percent of the Bush tax cut costs through the end of the decade. It’s questionable whether the divided Congress will agree on a bipartisan package of spending cuts and revenue increases to achieve the maximum $2.4 trillion goal in debt savings. If it does, the savings over the decade would equal 61.5 percent of the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. But three analysts said Scott’s use of the $2.1 trillion figure is solid. His claim lands close to a moving bull’s-eye and we rate it True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-29T06:00:00	2011-08-01	['None']
pomt-14742	The Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/17/chris-larson/state-sen-chris-larson-mark-claim-about-milwaukee-/	State Sen. Chris Larson supported Chris Abele’s bid for the Milwaukee County executive post in 2011. Now, Larson is challenging the incumbent and trying to convince voters Abele’s time in office hasn’t been successful. Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat and former member of the County Board, appeared Nov. 22, 2015 on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha program and said he’s disappointed in Abele’s leadership. "He’s out of touch," Larson said. Gousha listed some of Abele’s successes and asked, "Does he get any credit for (the successes)?" Larson countered by attacking one of Abele’s main talking points -- transit. Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation." We recently checked Abele’s claim that since he took office "we have never raised" bus fares and "this year there’ll be a million more route-miles than there were five years ago." We rated the claim Mostly True. Budget documents show fares have been $2.25 since Abele took office in 2011 and route-miles are up by about 1 million. But Abele credited himself for the increased route miles, when many of them were the result of a settlement related to a lawsuit. So, fares have stayed at $2.25. But is Larson right that they are "among the highest fares in the nation"? National comparison The Milwaukee County Transit System charges a flat fare of $2.25 in cash for a one-way adult bus ticket. Patrons who get a Smart Card pay $1.75 per ride. Transfers are free. When asked for backup, Larson’s team sent a list with the one-way adult bus fare for 11 cities. In that comparison, only Pittsburgh was higher than Milwaukee County, charging $2.50 for a base fare that increases to $3.75 for longer trips. Two other cities -- Denver and Cleveland -- charge $2.25 per ride, the same as Milwaukee County. In 2016, fares in Denver will increase to $2.60. But is Larson cherry picking the data? When we reached out to the Milwaukee County Transit System for its take, officials compiled a list of 20 systems comparable in size to MCTS. That list showed seven transit systems with higher base fares than Milwaukee County. At the top was Pittsburgh, with fares in Seattle and the Twin Cities rounding out the top three, at fares of up to $3.25 and $3, respectively. Another four systems had rates above $2.25 for longer routes (matching Milwaukee County) or charged $1 for a transfer (something that is free in Milwaukee County). There is no great single resource for information of bus fares across the country and the fares are often change. One survey conducted by the American Public Transit Association in 2014 compares about 250 transit systems across the country, though some of its data is already outdated. At the time, nine cities on that list charged more than Milwaukee’s $2.25 cash fare. The highest fare -- in Nashville -- was $4 per ride. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation." But the system’s’ $2.25 cash fare wasn’t at the top of a national comparison, with fares reaching as high as $4 per trip. And regular patrons who use a Smart Card are charged just $1.75 a ride, making the Milwaukee County bus system about on par with average costs. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06804	Says Republican recall challenger Jonathan Steitz "failed to pay his taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/gop-recall-candidate-jonathan-steitz-failed-pay-hi/	The Greater Wisconsin Committee, a liberal group active in Wisconsin politics, has asserted itself in the historic state Senate recall campaigns. In the two remaining races, which will be decided Aug. 16, 2011, it has accused Republican challengers of not paying their taxes. In a North Woods race, the Madison-based group said tea party leader Kim Simac, who is running against Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years." We rated that claim True. The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a similar statement against Jonathan Steitz, a lawyer who is trying to oust Sen. Bob Wirch, D-Pleasant Prairie, in a Kenosha-based district in the state’s southeastern corner. A headline on a flier hat the group mailed to voters Aug. 4, 2011 says: "Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes." The wording on that claim is much less specific than on the one against Simac. But we have been down a similar road before. In one of the six recall races decided Aug. 9, 2011, Democratic challenger and eventual winner Jessica King said during the campaign that Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, "didn’t pay" his state income taxes, in contrast to average voters who declared "we work hard, we pay our taxes." We ruled that statement Mostly False because in the years Hopper didn’t pay the taxes, he didn’t owe any. So, let’s dig into the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim that Steitz, who is making his first run for public office, "failed to pay his taxes." The flier that makes the claim contains a footnote, which cites a Kenosha County court case. Kirk Brown, spokesman for the committee, referred us to an online court summary of the case. The summary shows the state filed a tax warrant against Steitz in November 2003 for $1,875 plus $853 for interest and a penalty, for a total of more than $2,700. The summary also shows the warrant was paid off two months later. Brown said that was the only evidence the Greater Wisconsin Committee relied on in claiming that Steitz failed to pay taxes. Steitz campaign spokesman Dan Hunt said the tax warrant was issued because Steitz failed to make a sales tax payment in September 2002 for a business that he owned that staged events such as concerts. Hunt called it an oversight, saying most of the business’ work was done outside of Wisconsin, so Steitz did not have to regularly pay Wisconsin sales taxes. Hunt also said Steitz owed -- and paid -- a total of only $260, even though the court summary indicates he owed and paid more than 10 times that amount. We turned to Diane Hardt, a tax administrator with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. She said she could not discuss a particular taxpayer, but she said tax warrants are issued only after a taxpayer has received more than one notification that a payment is owed and only after the taxpayer is given at least 60 days to pay. Hardt also said that when the department issues tax warrants, the amount of tax demanded of the taxpayer and reflected in court records is estimated and inflated, sometimes by as much as 10 times what ultimately is determined to be owed. Hardt said the department inflates its estimate of what will actually be owed in hopes of getting the taxpayer to respond quickly. Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a flat statement -- "Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes." There is a basis for it in that nine years ago Steitz failed to make one monthly sales tax payment for a business he owned. But the claim leaves out important details -- namely, that he paid up two months later and there is no evidence he failed to pay other taxes. That fits our definition for Half True.

pomt-13941	Says the Clinton Foundation "accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates," which violated "a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/jun/20/steve-chabot/ohios-steve-chabot-compares-trump-u-clinton-founda/	On his blog, Steve Chabot, Republican congressman for Ohio’s 1st District, tapped out some friendly advice in an open letter to presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump faces a pending lawsuit against his eponymous Trump University. As a "recovering lawyer," Chabot wrote, "settle the damn case, and apologize to the judge." Earlier this month, Trump caused the GOP heartburn when he accused the federal judge over the case of being unfair because of his Mexican heritage. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is a first-generation U.S. citizen, born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Chabot advised Trump to throw a blanket over his sticky legal situation ASAP, because, "when it comes to ripping off the public, you’re a piker compared to Hillary and Bill Clinton." (Definition of piker: a small-time gambler.) Chabot continued: Even the Obama Administration recognized the inherent conflict of interest issues with respect to the Clinton Foundation, and therefore recommended a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations. The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates. We’re going to unpack that statement to see if the Clinton Foundation did violate a ban and accept millions. ‘Ban’ on foreign donations When the Obamas were prepping for their move into the White House in 2008, and Hillary Clinton was awaiting confirmation to the cabinet as secretary of state, Barack Obama’s Presidential Transitions Team and the CEO of the Clinton Foundation drew up a Memorandum of Understanding, with provisions to deal with conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. In the memorandum, the foundation pledged to publish its contributions from 2008, ahead of Hillary Clinton’s confirmation as secretary of state. For the duration of Hillary Clinton’s service at the State Department, the memorandum said, the foundation would seek approval from the State Department’s ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn’t given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels. Nowhere in the memorandum does the word "ban" appear. Memorandums of understanding are generally not legally binding. ‘Millions and millions?’ ‘Again and again?’ The Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars from Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman, which was allowed under the terms of the memorandum because they were previous donors. Oman is the only country included in Chabot’s blogged complaint. According to the foundation’s website, the Sultanate of Oman donated between $1 million and $5 million while Clinton was at the State Department (the foundation discloses its funding in ranges). This donation was not prohibited by the memorandum. The Washington Post reported that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia did not donate to the Clinton Foundation until after Clinton left the secretary of state’s post, in 2013. Our own reporting found the same thing. That leaves Algeria. Algeria! On Jan. 12, 2010, the day after a massive earthquake struck Haiti, Clinton Foundation officials admitted that they failed to seek State Department approval before accepting an unsolicited donation from the Embassy of Algeria of $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund. The foundation staff told us the foundation did not seek pre-approval in part because it did not have prior knowledge of Algeria’s intended contribution and in part because of the urgency of Haiti’s needs. The donation was disclosed on the foundation’s website. Our ruling Chabot wrote, "The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and United Arab Emirates." The agreement, a memorandum of understanding, was not a ban. At the very least, the Clinton Foundation accepted $1.5 million from Algeria and Oman, and at most, $5.5 million. Oman’s donation was allowed under the memo’s terms, but Algeria’s was not. Is the amount likely "millions and millions?" Probably. The Clinton Foundation has accepted funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, too, but not while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. We rate his statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c643bdb6-f953-4775-afb7-95d0cfdb2227	None	Steve Chabot	None	None	None	2016-06-20T16:01:27	2016-06-08	['Saudi_Arabia', 'Oman', 'Algeria', 'United_Arab_Emirates', 'Clinton_Foundation']
pomt-03899	Says a majority of Americans -- and Republicans -- support his approach for deficit reduction.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-majority-american-people-agree-m/	The sequester lives, and it’s the Republicans’ fault, President Barack Obama told Americans on Friday. As blunt, broad spending cuts started their slow crawl across the federal government on March 1, 2013, the president said he just needed Republicans in Congress to "catch up to their own party and the country." That means an approach to deficit reduction that "asks something from everybody," he said, including raising tax revenue. Saying he believes Congress "can and must" replace the sequester’s cuts with "a more balanced approach," he added: "I don't think that's too much to ask. I don't think that is partisan. It's the kind of approach that I've proposed for two years. That's what I ran on last year. The majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans." Is that true? Do most Americans, including most Republicans, prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit? Polls supporting the president We searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president’s declaration. The best evidence in Obama’s favor was a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today as the sequester loomed. Researchers talked with 1,504 adults across the country from Feb. 13-18, 2013. The survey found broad concern over the federal budget deficit — and support for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. To reduce the budget deficit, 19 percent said the president and Congress should focus only on spending cuts. Just 3 percent preferred only tax increases. A strong majority — 76 percent — sought a combination of both. What about "a majority of Republicans"? Here was the breakdown of support for a mixed approach by party: Democrats: 90 percent Republicans: 56 percent Independents: 76 percent So, yes, the poll shows that a majority of Republicans support both spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit. A November 2012 poll from CNN/ORC International of 1,023 adults was in line with the Pew Center’s results. It asked, "If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that …" Only included cuts in government spending: 29 percent Or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans: 67 percent The party breakdown for the "combination" response? Democrats: 87 percent Republicans: 52 percent Independents: 60 percent Meanwhile, a Bloomberg News poll conducted Feb. 15-18 showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit "through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners, as the White House has proposed, rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions, as Republicans assert," according to Bloomberg’s article. (We didn’t see the actual poll.) We also came across this Fox News poll, conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters of 1,010 registered voters on Feb. 25-27. It asked, "In January, the president and Congress reached a budget agreement that raised tax rates on wealthy Americans and postponed making cuts to government spending. This time, would you prefer the budget deal reduces the deficit by focusing …" Only on cutting government spending: 33 percent Mostly on cutting spending, and a small number of tax increases: 19 percent On an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases: 36 percent Only on adding further tax increases: 7 percent Don't know: 5 percent So, a majority of respondents, 55 percent, supported a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The results we saw didn’t break out responses by party. Polls that don’t address or undermine Obama’s claim We asked House Speaker John Boehner’s office if there were other polls we should consider. Press secretary Brendan Buck pointed us to an NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 adults conducted Feb. 21-24. They were asked whether they supported the sequester’s automatic cuts, more cuts, or fewer cuts. A majority, 53 percent, either favored more cuts or the sequester’s automatic cuts, which Buck interpreted as support for Republicans’ cuts-only approach. But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they wanted to see revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. It focused on cuts only. Meanwhile, 50 percent agreed with the statement: "These spending cuts are too severe and will hurt our economy. The President and Congress need to find a way to reduce our deficit by working together to avoid this from happening." While 46 percent agreed with: "Washington has become too partisan and the President and Congress cannot reach an agreement on reducing our deficit. Allowing these spending cuts to go into place may not be perfect, but it is time for dramatic measures to reduce the deficit.** The poll results don’t directly support Obama’s claim. But they don’t undercut it, either. Buck also mentioned a survey from Rasmussen Reports, a survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 24-25. It asked, "Should the long-term federal budget deficit be reduced by cutting spending, by raising taxes, or combination of tax hikes and spending cuts?" Rasmussen’s respondents found cutting spending the most attractive approach, with 45 percent support. Just 6 percent, it said, supported raising taxes alone. So, a plurality supported the Republican approach of cutting spending only, while a minority supported Obama’s solution. It’s worth noting that some polling experts, such as the New York Times’ Nate Silver, have raised issues with Rasmussen’s methodology. Its "robopoll" strategy, which uses a digitally recorded voice to conduct interviews, showed a statistical bias toward Republicans in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Meanwhile, Pew’s work in 2012 was more favorable toward Obama than the pollster consensus (though Silver hasn’t raised issues with Pew, which he says he respects). Buck also mentioned a survey from Republican polling firm Winston Group, but beyond the poll’s conservative phrasing, it had the same issue as the NBC/WSJ poll — it didn’t offer respondents the choice of a mixed approach to replacing the sequester. It asked registered voters only whether they preferred Republican spending cuts or Democratic revenue increases or sequester delay. They favored Republican spending cuts over Democratic revenue increases by 52 percent to 40 percent. One other way the president doesn’t enjoy majority support: Just a plurality of Americans, rather than a majority, wanted Congress to pass legislation to avoid the sequester, according to Gallup. Our ruling Obama said of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that "the majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans." We found two polls that supported his statement in its entirety, several polls that supported at least the first half, and polls from Rasmussen and Republican pollster Winston Group presented more of a mixed picture. The majority of the polls we found support the president. We rate the president’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08735	McDonald's in England only sells organic milk and free-range eggs, which provides more nutritious offerings than in the U.S.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/31/jamie-oliver/chef-jamie-oliver-praises-mcdonalds-england/	Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a well-known crusader for healthier eating. So it may have come as a surprise to hear him give a shout-out on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 29, 2010, to the fast-food giant McDonald's -- or at least the restaurants in his homeland, England. Oliver, AKA the Naked Chef, is perhaps best known to American audiences for his Emmy-winning reality program Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution on ABC, in which he tried to transform the eating habits of the residents of Huntington, W.Va., statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country. On ABC's This Week, Oliver said the food revolution is about giving people the tools to make good, nutritious choices. But host Christiane Amanpour asked Oliver to respond to a comment David Letterman made to him when he appeared on the Late Show: "Try as hard as you might, you're never going to succeed, because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food which is inherently unhealthy," Letterman said. Said Oliver: "In the one way, he's right. You know, the structure of commerce and food in America is so intertwined in broadcast, print media, advertising, TV. I think that the problem we have to have -- and it's an interesting one. I'll throw it back at you. Like fast food I've hated for many years. And the last two years, I like stopped. And I actually now start to see (fast food chains) ironically as part of the solution. "Now, I'll give you -- I'll give you one brand, like McDonald's. McDonald's, in England, has had its best three years ever, profitability. It only sells organic milk, free range eggs. You know, it's got an incredible standard of beef. And their ethics is really ... moving. But that's nothing like the one in the States. And the only distinguishing part is the public and what they expect." Part of the allure of McDonald's is its uniformity, that a Big Mac in New York will be the same as one in London. And so we wondered if Oliver was right that McDonald's restaurants in England really "only sell organic milk" and "free range eggs," and that, by implication, they are dramatically different and more healthy than McDonald's restaurants in the United States. We made queries with McDonald's officials in the U.S. and Britain, and neither responded, but we were able to piece together the pertinent facts from company web pages and documents. Let's break this into two parts. First, do McDonald's restaurants in England "only sell" organic milk? According to the McDonald's UK website, all of the bottled milk offered for sale in UK McDonald's (most of it sold along with kids' meals) is "semi-skimmed organic." In 2007, McDonald's UK made an even bigger commitment to organic milk, announcing that all the milk served with the teas and coffees it sells in 1,200 outlets in the UK will come from organic British cows. The company said organic farmers who supply McDonald's "don't use (genetically modified) feed or artificial pesticides in fields where their cows graze." Media reports suggested McDonald's alone could account for 5 percent of the UK’s organic milk supplies. Organic milk is not, however, used in milkshakes in the British stores. According to the website, "Organic milk is still a relatively small industry in the UK and McDonald's simply can't find a supplier that can meet the high volume demands. The company is in talks with the dairy industry about how it can facilitate more farmers switching to organic but, until the organic food supply chain can guarantee that it can supply the required amount, McFlurries, Sundaes and Milkshakes will continue to be made from non-organic milk from the British Isles." (In the U.S., McDonald's does not use organic milk.) Second, do McDonald's restaurants in England only use free-range eggs (meaning, eggs that come from hens that are not in cages and are free to roam outside)? McDonald's does, and the move generated quite a bit of positive press for McDonald's, including a "Good Egg" award from Compassion in World Farming in recognition of McDonald's Europe committing to using 100 percent free-range, cage-free eggs in all locations in the European Union by the end of this year. "We’re thrilled to be awarding such a well-known company for moving to cage-free eggs across the whole of Europe," said Dr. Lesley Lambert, Director of Research & Food Policy at Compassion in World Farming, in a press release for the award. "McDonald’s decision will benefit huge numbers of farm birds. By choosing to do the right thing on eggs across Europe, McDonald’s has shown great leadership on an issue which many consumers feel strongly about." McDonald's in the United States, however, has not embraced a similar switch. In April, the Humane Society of the United States (which owns stock in McDonald's USA) proposed to shareholders that the company switch 5 percent of the eggs it purchases for its U.S. locations to "cage-free" eggs by January 2011. The Board of Directors recommended against the switch, saying it would not be in the best interest of shareholders. "As we have examined this issue over the years, we have determined that there is no agreement in the global scientific community about how to balance the advantages and disadvantages of laying hen housing systems," the board wrote in a proxy statement. "Cage-free systems, for instance, allow birds to exhibit more natural behaviors, but may pose more risk with regard to the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant gap in scientific knowledge related to a wide range of sustainability impacts of laying hen housing—environmental impact, food safety, worker safety, animal health and well-being, and food affordability." According to a New York Times story about the proposal in May 2009, "McDonald’s USA announced its participation in a coalition with leading animal welfare scientists, academics, non-governmental organizations, such as the American Humane Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association, food manufacturers, egg suppliers and other retail companies to study housing alternatives for egg-laying hens in the U.S. The study will look at the sustainability impacts of different laying hen housing options, including cage-free aviary housing, enriched housing (which includes nests and perches) and conventional caged housing systems (currently used by the vast majority of the contemporary U.S. food supply system)." Paul Shapiro, senior director of the Humane Society’s factory farming campaign, said McDonald's has been "looking into" the issue for years. "There is a dramatic difference between the two companies (McDonald's in the U.S. versus the U.K.) with regard to animal welfare," Shapiro said. In April, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Lisa McComb, told the New York Times the disparity was due to the high consumer demand for cage-free eggs in Europe and a more robust cage-free egg production infrastructure there. Oliver doesn't explicitly argue the U.K. McDonald's restaurants offer more nutritious food, but given Amanpour's question -- and the topic of the segment -- we think many people would be left with that impression. So is it true that the organic milk and free-range eggs mean healthier food than in the U.S.? "No, that would not reliably mean better nutrition," said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine. "It appeals to the popular sentiment, without changing much about the food." One can make a case that using "cage-free" hens is more humane to the animals, Katz said, but that doesn't directly correlate to better nutrition for consumers (though it may reduce the risk of bacterial infection). As for using organic skim milk, Katz said there is definitely value, health-wise, to using fat-free milk. But the nutritional value of organic milk versus non-organic is unproven, he said. "I am a proponent of organic dairy," Katz said. "But there is no definitive evidence that organic means better health value in people. I think there's probably a potentially small movement in nutritional value. But there is a much larger movement in public perception." Katz said McDonald's could take much more meaningful steps to improve the nutritional value of its food, for example, by changing to whole wheat bread in buns or making the burgers lower in saturated fat. But just switching to organic milk and using free-range eggs doesn't much alter the nutritional value of McDonald's meals, he said. As for Oliver's comment, he's correct that McDonald's in England uses organic milk. Organic milk is served with coffee and tea, and for bottled milk. But Oliver was off a bit when he said it "only uses" organic milk. The British McDonald's stores still use non-organic milk in milkshakes. Oliver was on the mark when he noted that in the U.K., McDonald's uses only free-range eggs, while they are not used in the U.S. But when Oliver said McDonald's in England is "nothing like" the U.S. one, he implies the policies in England translate to substantially more nutritional food offerings. While the U.K. policies have drawn praise from animal rights groups, experts say it's a stretch to say they translate to better nutrition. And so we rule Oliver's claim Half True.

pomt-14698	"We are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/11/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffes-claim-record-school-budget-dubious/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says his two-year state budget proposal would bestow unprecedented riches on Virginia’s public schools. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history," he said on Dec. 17 as he introduced his budget to the General Assembly’s money committees. "We’re not only setting a record in total state spending on education; we’re also pushing up our per-pupil contribution to $5,446 in 2018," McAuliffe added. "Again, this is the highest level of student support in our history." We wondered whether the governor’s budget truly would be a record breaker for public schools, which suffered deep state cuts during the most recent recession and have struggled for years to regain those funds. Raw dollars Christina Nuckols, McAuliffe’s deputy press secretary, sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. The chart also carried forward those figures for each of the next two fiscal years in the governor’s biennial budget proposal. In raw dollars, McAuliffe’s overall school budget would exceed the record $6.45 billion being spent during the current school year. lt would raise education spending to $6.54 billion next school year and to $6.82 billion during the 2017-18 term. Many of those new dollars, if matched by local school systems, would fund about 2,500 new instructional jobs over the biennium and a 2 percent pay raise for teachers in July 2017. In raw dollars, the governor’s spending plan also would break the state record of funding $5,248 per student - set during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget that was approved before the recession decimated revenues. McAuliffe’s budget would increase that level to $5,251 in 2016-17. The following school year, it would rise to $5,446. What about inflation? There’s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was spent each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn’t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history. The governor’s claim failed this test. We adjusted each of the education budgets since 2001 to 2015 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $6.96 billion on public education. That figure exceeds the peak $6.83 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe’s 2017-18 budget. And the governor’s outlay drops further in the rankings when it’s adjusted for inflation. Financial forecasters generally are predicting annual 2 percent inflation rates for the next few years. If that proves accurate, then the adjusted dollars in McAuliffe’s peak education budget in 2017-18 would fall below the inflation-revised level of three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009. We applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia’s rising enrollments. The glory years for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets that were in effect from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2015 dollars, spent $5,524 to $5,825 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe’s peak proposal of $5,446 per student doesn’t rise to that level in raw dollars and falls further when adjusted for inflation. Our ruling "We are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history," McAuliffe said last month. In raw dollars, the governor’s proposed budget would set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is a misleading way of comparing spending levels, because raw dollars lose value over time. A meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that’s done, the governor’s education budget does not rise to the levels reached one to three years before the most recent recession. So we rate the governor’s claim Mostly False.

The Daily World Update story is pure fiction. A day before this story appeared, the same website said that Clinton was killed attempting to do a stunt while filming a documentary in Missouri as well as in an FBI raid in New York. The latest story said Clinton was sitting at the Chappaqua Motor Speedway in upstate New York (spoiler: it doesn’t exist) "when 11 tons of American steel and irony jumped the rails, injuring thirty-five people and killing Clinton." Clinton’s Twitter feed shows what she has actually been up to, and it doesn’t involve monster truck rolls.

pomt-02078	A proposed amendment "allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/22/dont-let-florida-go-pot/medical-marijuana-amendment-allows-teenager-get-re/	Family Feud time! Today’s question: Name something most teenagers cannot do. Vote? Ding! See R-rated movies alone? Ding! Buy beer? Ding! Score some weed without a hitch under Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment? BUZZZZ! An anti-marijuana coalition operating the website DontLetFloridaGoToPot.com has claimed as much. Among the talking points was the assertion, "The amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent." There’s already plenty of debate over the legalities of Amendment 2, which is on the November ballot. But can teens easily score a nickel bag solo should it pass? We’ll have to take our own survey and see what it says. A minor hitch Amendment 2 calls for the state to allow patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and unspecified "other conditions" to obtain medical marijuana with a doctor’s written recommendation. Technically, the physicians won’t write prescriptions, because marijuana would still be illegal under federal law. If 60 percent of voters ratify the amendment, the state must set up a dispensary system and write regulations for growing and selling the drug. The Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot website lists more than 40 "coalition partners." The Orlando Sentinel reported the site is run by Save Our Society From Drugs, a St. Petersburg-based lobbying group, and the Florida Sheriffs Association. The sheriffs association’s tax status prevents it from actively lobbying for people to vote against Amendment 2, but the group publicly opposes the measure. The sheriff’s association and Save Our Society did not answer our questions about why they think teens will be free to roll up spliffs without asking mom and dad first. Others have complained the measure’s language doesn’t set a minimum age, and therefore targets minors. But the vague amendment language is by design, according to the organization behind the amendment. United for Care attorney Jon Mills told PolitiFact Florida that by not addressing the age issue, a topic that was discussed while drafting the proposal, the amendment allows state law to take precedent on the issue of age. Currently, a parent or guardian must provide consent for medical treatment for a minor, except in emergencies or other unusual circumstances, such as when the Department of Children and Family Services must get involved. The absence of an age limit is to allow the state freedom to write the rules as they see fit, should the amendment pass and become part of the state Constitution. "If we put a minimum age in we’d never be able to modify it," Mills said, referring to how the amendment will change the state’s Constitution, rather than creating a new statute, as many medical marijuana states do. There are 21 states with laws that allow medical cannabis. Only three (California, Washington and Massachusetts) make no mention of minors in their language, as in the Florida amendment. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors measures to allow medical marijuana, said all three still require parental involvement in some way. Minnesota, which will soon be the 22nd state to allow it, also doesn’t include language about children. Three other states (Connecticut, Delaware and Illinois) specifically exclude allowing minors to use the drug -- and Illinois is on the brink of changing its law concerning kids. The other 15 allow children access to the drug to some degree but only with parental consent. "In Florida, I think there is no way that minors will actually ultimately be allowed to sign up for medical marijuana without their parent or guardian’s support. In fact, the rules may be even more strict than they are in most states," O’Keefe said. She compared Amendment 2 to Massachusetts’ 2012 law, which didn’t mention minors. The state ended up heavily regulating use by children. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos pointed out that any teenager would have to go through the same vetting process as adults. That means they would undergo whatever examination, registration and regulation process the state creates. "Does this mean a 13-year-old could just go in and get a certification? That’s not the case in any state," he said. "There’s nothing about the Florida proposal that says Florida would be worse than any other state." So if concerns about minors are unfounded, could Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot potentially mean 18- or 19-year-olds? They’re technically teenagers. Mikos says if that’s what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot is saying, "it’s a very misleading statement meant to scare people." He points out that 18-year-olds are allowed to buy tobacco and are allowed prescriptions to Oxycontin, so marijuana probably shouldn’t be treated any differently. Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who edits a marijuana policy blog, says the opposition’s concern about teen use could possibly be better illustrated by the possibility of those older teens exploiting the system. "There’s nothing in this to stop college kids on spring break to go into the doctor’s office and saying, ‘My back hurts,’ and getting some, not for medicinal purposes, but because they want to have fun," Berman said. But focusing on that angle in medical legislation is a dubious argument. "There’s nothing else in medicine that we go to a 19-year-old and say, ‘Hey, you need your parents’ permission," Berman added. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot says "the amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent." The group didn’t offer us any specifics on what it meant. The amendment is actually silent on the issue of minors. The proposal’s framers say they specifically didn’t include minors in its language in order to let state law reign supreme. Policy experts said state regulations usually dictate parental consent is necessary, and there’s no reason to think Florida would be any different. We should note that in all probability, 18- and 19-year-olds would have access like any other adult. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01007	The streetcar project proposed for downtown Milwaukee "would actually take precious revenue away" from the Milwaukee Public Schools.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/03/joe-davis-sr/ald-joe-davis-claims-streetcar-project-would-hurt-/	A key opponent of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan for a $123.9 million downtown streetcar is criticizing the project by saying it would hurt Milwaukee Public Schools. Ald. Joe Davis Sr., who is running for mayor in the 2016 election, had this to say in a YouTube video: The streetcar would "actually take precious revenue away from one of the taxing industries which I truly care about, and that is the Milwaukee Public School system." We haven’t heard the phrase "taxing industry" before, but we have heard variations of the claim. Would the streetcar project "take precious revenue away" from MPS? The money picture Let’s start with where the money is coming from to build the controversial project (the budget for operating it is a separate question). The primary source of funding is a $55 million federal grant. The city hopes for another $10 million from the feds. The remainder would come from various taxing districts, including $9.7 million that has already been authorized by the Common Council. Barrett wants to borrow another $49.3 million that would be repaid through two Tax Incremental Districts, or TIDS. The districts typically work like this: The city pays for infrastructure improvements, such as new or reconfigured roads or site preparation to help assure a development takes place. The money the city borrows is repaid through taxes generated by the increased value of properties within the district. Once the borrowing is paid off, the value of the land is added to the general tax rolls. Under Barrett’s plan, some of the streetcar borrowing ($31 million) would be rolled into a new TID -- No. 82 -- near downtown's lakefront that would also include the proposed Couture high rise project. The rest ($18.3 million) would come from an existing TID -- No. 56 -- on E. Erie St. in the Historic Third Ward. Here’s the catch: The borrowing from that second TID is nearly paid off. So, instead of that money going to the general tax rolls, the life of the district would be extended and the money from the increased property taxes would go to repay the streetcar borrowing. That makes this district central to Davis’ argument. After all, when property is tied up in a district, none of the other taxing units -- such as MPS and Milwaukee County -- can collect money based on the increasing value. Indeed, when we asked Davis for backup, he responded with an email linking to a Jan. 7, 2015 memo from the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau, which does research on issues for the Common Council. The memo says "total estimated property tax deferrals for all taxing entities" from the two tax districts that would help fund the streetcar would be $104 million, and says the MPS portion of that sum is $40 million. We’re already heading down the wrong track. In the video, Davis said the project would take revenue away from MPS. The memo talks about property tax deferrals from tax districts. That phrasing sounds like it would be money otherwise collected by MPS. In reality, that $40 million represents the MPS "share" of the projected increased overall property value within the districts. It is MPS’ ability to draw on this value to collect taxes that would be "deferred." No matter how you characterize it, there isn’t money currently flowing to MPS that will be choked off by the streetcar. Additionally, by law, tax money being collected through a TID can’t be used for other purposes such as police or, for that matter, other taxing entities such as MPS. Indeed, on Feb. 3, 2014, the Legislative Reference Bureau retracted the earlier memo saying it was based on "inaccurate assertions and incomplete analysis" and that the analysis had "misinformed and become a distraction from this important policy debate." Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said Davis is "wrong on several counts." "As debt is incurred to fund TID improvements, those bonds are repaid with the incremental property tax revenue that comes from the new increased value of the TID," Berry said in an email. "Other units of government would never have received that money anyway, because without (the district) there would be no increased value." Indeed, Berry said, the opposite of Davis’ claim might be the case -- if a district works as planned. "In the long run, schools, etc. will get more money than they would otherwise have received" because those entities will eventually have a larger tax base, he said. We also asked MPS about the impact of tax districts on revenue. The "districts do not directly impact MPS' revenue authority under the funding rules for K-12 education," said MPS spokesman Tony Tagilavia. Davis did not respond to emails or telephone messages seeking an interview on the matter. More to consider There is another wrinkle to Davis’ claim. For the new TID, the one surrounding the Couture development, Berry’s argument clearly holds true. The development is contingent on the TID. And there are no new taxes generated without the increased value from the development. But what about the second, existing TID -- the one about to go back onto the tax rolls? Wouldn’t that money otherwise go to MPS and the other taxing entities? Yes and no. The increased value would be added to the city’s overall property tax base, which MPS and the other entities draw upon. But the amount collected in taxes for schools is driven by the MPS budget and the spending plan from the School Board. That is, once MPS and the other taxing entities set their annual budgets, the portion to be collected from property taxes is simply divided into the city’s overall property base. This sets the annual tax rate, which in turn creates the tax bills. As such, there may be more capacity for MPS to collect taxes -- but other factors, including state-imposed property tax caps play a role in how much of that new, increased tax base MPS can tap. A separate memo -- in response to the one from the Legislative Reference Bureau -- made this very point. That memo was written Jan. 8, 2015 by city budget director Mark Nicolini and Assessment Commissioner Mary Reavey, both part of Barrett’s administration. "There are no ‘property tax deferrals’ nor any other automatic revenue growth that occurs when TIDs are closed," the memo said. A final footnote: The city currently has 45 active taxing districts, with some performing better than others. Twice in the past the city has redirected revenue from the high-performing TID 56 -- the one slated to be redirected to the streetcar -- to bolster "neighborhood-based" TIDs in the central city. In all, about $10.5 million has gone to this purpose. Davis voted in favor of those previous changes to TID 56, as well as in favor of about $225 million in projects using the same kind of tax district funding, council records show. Our rating Davis says the streetcar project would take revenue away from Milwaukee Public Schools. He bases his argument on the use of two tax financing districts that would help pay for the streetcar project. From a technical perspective, he is off base. Taxes generated on additional development in the tax districts would go -- by law -- to the designated use until the borrowing is paid off. And once the districts close, it still wouldn’t be direct revenue for the schools. Rather, it’s additional tax base. From our perspective, that does lend some credibility to Davis claim. If the increased value went onto the overall tax rolls, all property taxpayers in the city would benefit. And, in theory, MPS could collect more without taking a bigger bite out of the pocketbooks of property owners. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12364	"Nearly $2 billion in cash was flown over to Iran, money that the Obama administration has admitted is being used for terrorists and to support further activities there."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/06/karen-handel/Handel-pushes-details-Iran-deal-terror-support/	All politics might be local but foreign policy dominated the open of the televised debate in the Georgia congressional race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. Asked about Iran and the Barack Obama-era deal that was designed to put the brakes on its nuclear program, Handel said, "Nearly $2 billion in cash was flown over to Iran, money that the Obama administration has admitted is being used for terrorists and to support further activities there." We decided to fact-check Handel’s claim. Iran nuclear deal The Iran deal focused on reducing Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear-grade material, but a key provision unlocked Iranian assets that had been frozen for decades. How much money was there is a matter of debate. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Handel’s $2 billion Handel’s staff pointed to a March 17, 2016, letter from the U.S. State Department saying Iran had received about $1.7 billion as part of the nuclear agreement. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but then the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. In August 2016, many news organizations reported the delivery of $400 million of that $1.7 billion in cash. As part of that exchange, an unmarked cargo plane delivered the money after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. Given the isolation of Iran’s banking system, it is possible that the payment was made in cash and flown to Iran, but neither we nor Handel’s staff could point to any report that said that definitely took place. Money for terrorism The idea that the Obama administration admitted that the money is being spent on terrorists comes from something then-Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview. Kerry told CNBC’s Squawk Box in January 2016 that Iran could spend the unfrozen assets however it wanted. "I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists," Kerry said. "To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented." The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and "presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life," according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately would end up with organizations involved in terrorism. That’s not quite the same as saying all of the money would go for terrorists and activities to support terrorism as Handel said. Iran has many needs, including rebuilding aging infrastructure. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is "already complaining that they are not getting the money." Our ruling Handel said the Obama administration admitted that nearly $2 billion flown to Iran is being used to fund terrorism and various supporting activities. She is more specific than the record supports. One way or another, the United States transferred $1.7 billion owed to Iran. As for what the administration admitted, Kerry said it was likely that some portion of any money Iran received would go to its top security organization and some of that money would end up advancing terrorism. Beyond that general statement, details are lacking. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08092	The tax cut deal is giving "$700 billion to millionaires and billionaires."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/15/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-overstates-amount-millionaires-a/	The rich are different from you and me. With apologies to F. Scott Fitzgerald, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has been prone recently to talk about the rich. They tend to want tax breaks. To be more precise, Republicans want lavish tax breaks for their rich constituents, says Brown, an Ohio Democrat. And some of these breaks go too far, says Brown, citing the recent deal to extend all Bush-era tax breaks, which President Barack Obama and congressional Republican leaders announced on Dec. 6. Three days after that announcement, Brown told Kathleen Parker and Eliot Spitzer on CNN, "You know basically what we're doing here is we're borrowing $700 billion from the Chinese. We're charging it to our kids’ and grandkids' credit cards for them to pay off later and then we're giving that $700 billion to millionaires and billionaires." That’s a lot of money, even for billionaires, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. We’re not here to ask whether whether it’s fair or whether it will trickle down and help the economy. We’re asking something more basic: Will there really be $700 billion worth of tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires? A short answer: No. That’s because Brown’s figure is loaded with an assumption and a rhetorical flourish. The assumption is that the top income tax bracket for people with high incomes will remain at 35 percent for 10 more years. That’s roughly what it would take for the tax cuts for the nation’s top 2 percent of earners to reach a cost of $700 billion, according to projections in August by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Republicans at the time were pushing for a permanent extension of all the cuts that Congress passed in 2001 and 2003, and tax writers in the House of Representatives asked the joint committee to run a cost projection. The problem with using that figure now is that the Obama-GOP deal, and the resulting tax package that Congress could approve this week, calls for extending the tax breaks for only two more years. A 10-year extension is not on the table. It is true, as Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak notes, that Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other economic advisers used the $700 billion figure as recently as September. They sounded a lot like Brown. But that was before the White House cut the two-year extension deal. What figure should Brown have used? The answer depends on the rhetorical flourish we mentioned, which is this: That $700 billion figure for ten years includes a whole lot of people who are neither millionaires nor billionaires. The figure, in fact, includes all single filers earning more than $200,000 a year and joint filers earning more than $250,000. If you added up all the tax filers expected to report incomes of more than $200,000 in 2012, you’d get 7.5 million people, according to a rough calculation using figures from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. But out of that 7.5 million people, only 531,000 would be from people with incomes of $1 million or more. So the figure used by Brown -- and previously used by others -- includes "millionaires, billionaires and a whole bunch of people with incomes below that," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Using a slightly different technical perspective, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that out of 161 million tax filers nationwide, 315,000 earn at least $1 million. People earning less than that can be considered millionaires, of course, because of their home values, investments and net worth. But to call a two-earner couple making $251,000 "millionaires and billionaires" exaggerates matters, and the $700 billion projection that Brown used never included such an assumption. So if the cost is not $700 billion for millionaires and billionaires, what is it? The Joint Committee projections earlier this year showed that a single year of extensions for just the $1 million-and-above filers would cost $32.7 billion. Run out over 10 years, that would come to $327 billion, although this is a rough estimate because the number of filers and their incomes and deductions can vary year to year. The best estimate available comes from Joint Committee projections released on Dec. 10, a day after Brown spoke on CNN. They show the cost of retaining both the 33 percent tax bracket and the 35 percent bracket for two more years would come to $60.7 billion. This, too, covers a lot more people than millionaires and billionaires. There is a chance that the two-year deal will be extended again in 2012. Obama, who is up for re-election that year, has not said as much, but Spitzer suggested it to Brown on CNN, and Brown agreed. "Nobody really believes this is only a two-year extension of middle class tax cuts or the payroll tax holiday or the income tax cut or frankly the estate tax cut," Brown said. "I don't think anybody thinks that's only a two-year extension. I think it's well into the future. Who knows how to predict, five or 10 years out?" But he did know how to project, and he chose 10 years. How to rate Brown’s statement, then? His $700 billion cost figure certainly was used by the Obama White House when rejecting another 10 years worth of tax cuts for top earners. Yet by the time Brown appeared on CNN (three days after the administration announced the compromise), the deal was for two years, and it was that very deal that Brown went on the air to criticize. Even if the deal had been for 10 years, Brown misapplied the cost figure by describing the whole $700 billion as going to millionaires and billionaires. Joint Committee projections from earlier this year estimated that cost would be more like $327 billion over 10 years. Those are two key points on which Brown’s statement simply is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement False.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2010-12-15T06:00:00	2010-12-09	['None']
pomt-15091	"We're the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting our crude oil to other nations."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/17/barry-duval/barry-duval-says-us-only-major-oil-producer-bans-c/	Barry DuVal, president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, says it’s time for the U.S. to scrap its 40-year-old ban on exporting domestic oil. "We’re the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting our crude oil to other nations," DuVal said in an Aug. 25 radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Hampton Roads-based broadcast. We wondered whether DuVal was correct. Chamber spokesman Paul Logan backed the statement by pointing us to an Aug. 11 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that made a similar statement. Logan provided no other materials, so we did some digging on our own. The export ban The U.S. put the ban in place in 1975, two years after an embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries halted crude oil deliveries to the United States. Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, told Congress last December that the embargo seriously curtailed U.S. oil imports and highlighted U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The export ban covers the vast majority of crude oil produced in the U.S. -- but it’s not an absolute prohibition. For example, it doesn’t bar crude exports to Canada as long as the oil is used in that country. There are other exemptions as well. Some heavy crude produced in California, for example, is not subject to the ban, according to the U.S. Bureau of Security and Industry. The U.S. exported 401,000 barrels of crude oil a day, most of it to Canada, in July 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. That month, EIA figures show the U.S. produced almost 8.8 million barrels of crude daily. We should also note that although the ban affects raw crude oil, it does not prohibit export of "refined" petroleum products, such as gasoline. There have been several unsuccessful congressional attempts to lift the ban in recent years in the wake of rising U.S. oil production. Amid the shale fracking boom, production increased from 5.4 million barrels a day in 2009 to 8.7 million barrels a day last year, according to EIA statistics. Efforts to lift the ban are ongoing. On Sept. 10, a House Energy and Power subcommittee approved a bill that would end the prohibition. Is the U.S. ban unique? EIA officials told us they weren’t aware of any other country with an export ban similar to the U.S. ban. But they stressed they couldn’t provide a definitive answer on whether the U.S. is the only nation among major oil producers that has such a limitation. So we turned to a couple of energy market analysts for further insight. Kenneth B. Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, told us in an email that DuVal’s statement is correct. "The US is the only major producing country that does not allow exports of raw crude oil," he wrote in an email. Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution, also told us the U.S. is alone among major oil-producing countries in having the export ban. American Petroleum Institute, which supports scrapping the export ban, released a report this month saying "the U.S. and China are the only major oil producers in the world that don’t export a significant amount of crude." Ebinger, who also backs lifting the U.S. ban, says China’s tiny export of oil is not caused by a national ban. Instead, the low export is driven by high internal demand for oil within the nation, he said. Our ruling DuVal said the U.S. is the only major oil-producing nation in the world that bans export of its crude oil. Two experts we contacted agreed with DuVal’s statement, and officials at the EIA said they’re not aware of any other country with similar export restrictions. But the ban is not absolute -- a small portion of U.S. crude is exported to Canada. So we rate his DuVal’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05661	Says "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/19/john-mckeon/chris-christie-cut-1-billion-rebates-leading-20-pe/	New Jersey taxpayers are paying 20 percent more in property taxes, thanks to a $1 billion cut in rebates from Gov. Chris Christie, according to state Assemblyman John McKeon. In a March 4 interview on My9 News’ "New Jersey Now," the Essex County Democrat claimed "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent." PolitiFact New Jersey found a couple of problems with McKeon’s statement. Instead of $1 billion, Christie has reduced Homestead rebates by about $660 million since signing the fiscal year 2011 budget, his first spending plan as governor. That reduction in rebates coincided with a 20 percent property tax increase, but a state official disputed that figure, pointing out that rebates did not directly lower property tax bills in the past. First, let’s talk about the Homestead property tax credits. In fiscal year 2011, Christie cut funding for Homestead rebates by $850.4 million. But in fiscal year 2012, Christie increased funding by $189.8 million. So, during Christie’s tenure, there has been a net decrease of about $660.6 million in Homestead rebates. But McKeon argued that the governor cut rebates by about $1.5 billion. In addition to the $850 million cut in Christie’s first budget, the funding level in his second budget represented a "$683 million cut" from fiscal year 2010, according to McKeon. We told McKeon he was double-counting the governor’s cut in fiscal year 2011, but he maintained that his statement is "absolutely true." "Said in plain language, had Gov Christie funded rebates at the same level as the (level) in the final year before he took office, New Jersey taxpayers would have had $1.533 Billion dollars more in their pockets," McKeon told us in an e-mail. Now, let’s talk about that property tax increase. According to the state Department of Community Affairs, the average Homestead rebate was $1,037 in 2009 and $240 in 2011. After deducting the average Homestead rebates, the bill for "average net property taxes" was $6,244 in 2009 and $7,519 in 2011, according to the DCA. That’s a 20.4 percent increase in property taxes between 2009 and 2011. But the 2009 figure is misleading, DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an e-mail. Starting with the Christie administration, homeowners receive the rebates as credits on their property tax bills. But previously, the rebates were paid out in the form of checks and not applied directly to property tax bills, Ryan told us. In other words, although those checks were meant as property tax relief, that doesn’t mean homeowners used them to pay their property tax bills, according to Ryan. "An eligible homeowners’ property tax bill in 2009 – the actual bill – was not lowered because he/she received a rebate check in the mail," Ryan said. The heading of "average net property taxes" is "leftover from previous administrations that wanted to claim property tax rebates lowered property taxes when they did not," said Ryan, adding that state officials dispute that property taxes went up by 20 percent. McKeon rejected the department’s argument: "For us to even entertain an argument by the DCA controlled by the Governor that rebates not transmitted by credit shouldn't be counted doesn't even meet the laugh test." Our ruling In a TV interview, McKeon claimed "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent." But Christie cut about $660 million in Homestead rebates. Following the reduction in rebates, the average net property tax bill went up by about 20 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs. A DCA spokeswoman claimed the tax hike is inaccurate, because Homestead rebates were not used in previous years to directly lower property tax bills. Still, no matter how the rebates were distributed, their purpose always has been property tax relief. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14347	Texas "had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/mar/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-accurately-touts-record-raw-turnout-in/	After President Barack Obama criticized Republican-set voting laws in connection with Texas voter turnout, Gov. Greg Abbott suggested the Democratic president slipped a gear. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, said the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that "makes it harder for people to vote." Perhaps he was referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in more than a dozen states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot. Obama otherwise called it important to study ways of redesigning "our systems" to step up turnout. Then he said that "the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate." Abbott, a Republican, bridled at Obama’s pokes, telling reporters a few days later: "To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment." Really? We wondered because last year, we found Texas not doing well in voter turnout compared to other states. Specifically, U.S. Census research indicated that in November 2014, some 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote, placing Texas 45th among the states in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Also in 2014, nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens cast ballots, placing Texas 46th among the states. Nationally, 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out. Abbott didn’t respond when we sought the basis of his "record" claim. We found that his turnout tout holds up if you look at the raw count of voters in both 2016 primaries or even solely at the share of registered voters who participated in the Republican primary. However, no record was set in overall percentage turnout, arguably the best metric for population-adjusted comparisons over time. Record count of voters A post-primary Austin American-Statesman news story walked through the record number of voters: "More than 2.83 million Texans cast ballots in the GOP primary’s presidential contest, roughly double the number who voted in each of the past three state primaries," a result celebrated by Tom Mechler, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, in a party press release. According to the Texas secretary of state, nearly 1.4 million Texans voted in the 2008 GOP presidential primary and 1,449,477 voted four years later. The 2,832,271 voters who cast ballots in the dominant party’s 2016 primary was nearly a doubling from four years before. But Texas wasn’t alone in high voter counts. The Statesman story said: "A similar dynamic has played out in other states, with record or near-record Republican turnout for Super Tuesday contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Virginia — coming after marked gains in numbers of GOP voters in earlier contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina." Record Republican turnout, but... We asked the secretary of state’s office if any records in percentage turnout were set in the 2016 Texas primaries. By email, spokeswoman Alicia Pierce said 19.89 percent of the state’s registered voters participated in the Republican primary. By a wide margin, that amounted to a record for Texas Republican primaries, according to agency records covering turnout in statewide elections since 1972. The next-highest turnout in the party’s presidential primary occurred in 2012 and 1996. In each of those years, 11 percent of the state’s registered voters voted GOP. But the approximately 30 percent turnout across both primaries was not record-setting. Pierce noted the 33 percent turnout of registered voters in March 2008; that year, Democrats had a showdown between Obama and Hillary Clinton. "To get a percentage number higher than 2008 based on the number of registered voters," Pierce wrote, "you have to go back to 1980" when some 36 percent of registered voters joined the primaries. She said 1992 "came close with 29 percent of voters." Similarly, the records show, combined Texas primaries turnout in 1988 (36 percent) and some 1970s primaries exceeded 30 percent. In 1972, remarkably, 60 percent of registered voters participated in the primaries, all but 3 percent of them on the Democratic side -- again, no 2016 record there. Notably too, a March 16, 2016, Texas Tribune news story suggested the 2016 Texas turnout lagged turnout in nearly all of the states to have already held presidential primaries. That is, the more than 4.2 million Texas voters in 2016 represented nearly 25 percent of voting-eligible citizens 18 and older and that placed the state second to last among the 19 states that had already primaried for president, the story said. Our ruling Abbott said Texas "had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the" 2016 "primary." We don’t know if Abbott was tunnel-visioning raw counts of primary voters or if he was fixed on the 19 percent share of registered voters participating in the Republican primary. By both of these metrics, the 2016 turnout set Texas records. However, percentage turnout across both primaries was previously higher in several years including 2008, 1988 and 1972. This gubernatorial statement also failed to acknowledge that Texas remains among the nation’s lowest-turnout states. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11284	"Most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror.’"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/24/ro-khanna/are-most-our-taxes-spent-war-terror-no/	A recent Facebook post by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made an incorrect assertion about the scale of military spending in the federal budget. When PolitiFact contacted Khanna’s office, the congressman personally emailed us to say he was fixing the post — which happened before we could publish our fact-check. Our reporting started when a reader asked us to fact-check the April 19 post on Khanna’s Facebook page. Khanna’s post shared a graphic from the National Priorities Project, an effort sponsored by the liberal Institute for Policy Studies. The graphic was headlined, "Your Taxes Are Going to War." The part that caught our eye was Khanna’s personal comment alongside the graphic: "Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror’ which has sacrificed countless lives. It’s time to change our priorities." Here’s a screenshot of the original post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So we’ll do that here. Checking Khanna’s original post One tricky aspect of checking Khanna’s statement is that the federal budget does not cleanly separate "War on Terror" spending from overall national defense spending. Under a simple but admittedly generous definition, we assumed that the entirety of spending on national defense went to the "War on Terror." The reality is that many aspects of the federal military budget — from nuclear weapons to troops stationed in South Korea to the U.S. Marine Corps band — are far removed from the front lines of the "War on Terror." (Khanna offered us an even more expansive estimate that include veterans services, the State Department and other agency spending, but we decided to stick with our definition.) Another tricky aspect is that Khanna referred to "our taxes." It’s not always easy to determine what ordinary Americans pay in federal taxes. Obviously they pay income taxes directly, but many taxation specialists would say that taxpayers indirectly foot the bill for corporate taxes and for the employer’s share of payroll taxes. For simplicity, we decided to include all tax revenues collected by the federal government, regardless of type. So how does national defense spending compare with federal tax revenues? Federal tax receipts in 2017 totaled $3.3 trillion. By comparison, outlays for national defense totaled $598.7 billion. That works out to 18.1 percent of tax receipts — not "most" of our taxes, as Khanna originally put it. "It is pretty far off the mark to say that the majority of taxes are used for the wars," said Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Even if you wanted to expand it as broadly as possible to include all national defense, homeland security, and veterans funding, it still does not add up to half." In fact, while federal spending on national defense is sizable, it pales compared to social spending. If you add together the two programs Khanna cited — Medicaid and SNAP (what used to be called food stamps) — and further include Social Security and Medicare, those four programs collectively accounted for 60.4 percent of tax receipts, or more than three times the proportion spent on the military. It’s also worth remembering that all federal spending currently exceeds the amount of taxes collected -- that’s what having an annual deficit means. Looking at discretionary spending only Khanna would have been more accurate if he had clarified that he was talking about "discretionary spending" rather than the entire federal budget. What does that mean? There are actually four major types of spending. One type of spending, known as "mandatory spending," is essentially automatic, given to any American who’s eligible based on existing rules and formulas. This category includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. Another type of spending is interest on the federal debt. This spending is also mandatory, but is typically considered a separate category. The two remaining types fall under "discretionary spending." The term "discretionary" doesn’t necessarily mean less important, but it does mean that such lines of funding must be approved on a more or less annual basis by Congress. All spending on national defense falls into the category "defense discretionary spending." And all other types of federal spending — from the Labor Department to the Environmental Protection Agency — makes up the category "non-defense discretionary spending." This chart shows that non-defense discretionary spending slightly outpaces defense discretionary spending, but the two are very close. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So Khanna would have been closer to the mark if he’d said that national defense spending accounted for about half of discretionary federal spending. That’s what Khanna did when he changed the wording of his post. "We should have clarified that this was excluding mandatory spending," Khanna said in an email to PolitiFact. "The caption we used is clearly poorly written. We do believe it is the majority of discretionary spending when counting all of the costs of the war on terror — which are beyond defense. ... You were right to bring it to our attention." The new caption on Khanna’s post reads, "Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though a majority of our taxes, related to discretionary spending, go to the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ Post updated to clarify that these numbers are related to discretionary spending only — based on PolitiFact's Louis Jacobson’s comments." Our ruling Khanna’s original post said, "Most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror.’" That’s close to accurate if you specify that you’re referring to discretionary spending only, but the original post did not do that. To his credit, Khanna pointed out the distinction when he rewrote the post. We applaud the change, but our policy is to rate the original wording, and that earns the initial statement a False.

pomt-01370	"More than 70,000" job openings are listed on a state jobs website.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/17/scott-walker/plenty-jobs-people-wisconsin-who-want-work-scott-w/	Gov. Scott Walker broke his promise to create 250,000 jobs, but as he seeks re-election, he argues there are plenty of jobs for people in Wisconsin who are willing to work. "We don’t hear about this often enough, but we have a website called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com," Walker said at a campaign stop near Milwaukee on Sept. 20, 2014. "You know how many jobs were listed on that website last week?" the governor asked. "More than 70,000 jobs." There were gasps from the audience. "Jobs are not the problem," Walker continued. "Connecting people to those jobs with the skills they need and, more importantly, getting people off of the couch and off the dependence who are able and into those jobs, making it more effective, a bigger incentive for them to get back to work is really the difference." Walker has since repeated the claim, including during his first debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke on Oct. 10, 2014. Do his numbers add up? The website JobCenterOfWisconsin.com is run by the state Department of Workforce Development, whose secretary is appointed by Walker. The department describes the site as a no-cost employment exchange that links employers and job seekers. Its popularity appears to have grown dramatically in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election. The home page shows a running tally of the number of job openings listed on the site. In releasing a jobs plan on Sept. 16, 2014, Walker said there were more than 60,000 job openings on the site. By the morning of Oct. 17, the running tally on the site’s home page was just under 80,000. That’s an increase of roughly one-third in a month. Moreover, a plus-sign (+) next to the running tally indicates that even more jobs are available. The database We asked the Department of Workforce Development to provide us a spreadsheet showing all of the job openings on the website. We received it Oct. 9, 2014. There were more than 79,000 job listings on the main part of the spreadsheet, including about 74,000 that had been posted within the past six months. Those are the ones that power the running tally on the website’s home page. There were more than 65,000 listings on the second part of the spreadsheet. More on those in a minute. Those figures obviously are well above the more than 70,000 that Walker claimed. But whether there were that many jobs actually available is less clear: 1. The state itself doesn’t vouch for the accuracy of all the listings. Of the 79,000 primary listings on the site, about 41,000 are reviewed by state employees and are set to automatically expire after 90 days, the workforce development department told us. The other 38,000 primary listings come from two national "partners" and the department relies on those firms to update their listings. Regarding the other 65,000 listings -- which are not specifically counted on the home page of the website -- the state told us it advises job seekers to beware when searching those listings that they come from multiple sources and can include duplicates. Those sources include Career Builder and Craigslist. 2. Thousands of jobs are outside of Wisconsin. Walker made his claim in the context of jobs in Wisconsin, even if he didn’t specifically say that all 70,000 job openings were within the state’s borders. According to One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, about 13,000 of the job listings were for openings not in Wisconsin but in neighboring states, a figure the Department of Workforce Development did not dispute. Our own check found, for example, roughly 1,100 listings in Dubuque, Iowa, and roughly 950 each in Rockford, Ill., and Duluth, Minn. Finally, although Walker’s claim didn’t address the quality of jobs listed on the website, it’s worth noting that many are on the low end of the pay scale. Among the most common job titles advertised were cashier, certified nursing assistant, registered nurse and restaurant crew. Two of the three employers with the most job listings were McDonald’s and the Kwik Trip convenience store chain. Our rating Walker said "more than 70,000" job openings are listed on a state jobs website, JobCenterofWisconsin.com. The raw number of job listings exceeds that figure. But not all of the listings are verified by the state and thousands of the jobs are outside of Wisconsin. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-11987	"We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote ... but he’s in the hospital. And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes" to pass a health care bill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hospitalized-senator-g/	President Donald Trump claimed that Senate Republicans could pass a health care reform bill by the end of September if a senator’s hospitalization weren’t preventing him from casting the deciding vote. "We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote, a great person, but he’s in the hospital," Trump told Fox & Friends in a Sept. 27 interview. "And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes." Trump repeated similar claims throughout the day. "With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!" Trump tweeted Sept. 27. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to look more closely at whether Senate Republicans in fact have the needed votes, and if a hospitalized senator, unable to cast his "yes" vote, is preventing its passage. Do Senate Republicans have the votes? It doesn’t appear so. Under congressional rules, Republicans had until September 30 to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation. As of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans — Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — were firm "no" votes. Still others expressed skepticism about the overhaul. So at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber. Is the ‘hospitalized’ senator the sticking point? Trump’s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. For his part, Cochran tweeted yesterday to clarify that he was ill but not in the hospital. "Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon," Cochran tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Cochran’s office told the USA Today the senator was recovering from what they referred to as treatment for a "urological issue." It’s unclear whether Cochran’s health concerns would prevent him from returning to cast a vote on the health care reform. But what’s clear is that even with his vote, Senate Republicans are still short of the majority. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said Senate Republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who’s unable to cast the deciding vote. At most, Senate Republicans have 49 "yes" votes — that’s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul. This shortfall would not be overcome even with a "yes" vote from Cochran, who is not hospitalized, but rather recuperating at home after receiving medical treatment. We rate this False.

Sen.

Kemp’s office annually handles more than 430,000 license renewals for professionals across Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Unterman said this change would create another layer of government, which she said is counter to Republican Party principles. On the next to last day of this year’s session, Unterman offered a reason why some lawmakers supported the bill. She posted a graphic in front of her fellow senators detailing how much money some of them have received from dentists, pharmacists and some of their political action committees. The total: $142,400. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Unterman’s figure was correct, along with the context she included. "These figures up here are not everybody in this room," she said. "This is only leadership, and this is only for a one two-year term." Unterman added, hoping to shame some senators into voting against the bill: "Let your money do the dialing in the state Senate because the pharmacists and dentists had the money." Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider columnist Jim Galloway wrote that gasps could be heard from the lobbyists watching the proceedings. Some senators may have been searching for something more comfortable at that moment, like a root canal. The Senate passed the bill by 45-8 margin. Unterman voted against it. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the legislation last week. Unterman forwarded us 57 pages of records detailing the contributions. It took PolitiFact Georgia some time to dig through Unterman’s information and to conduct our own research. As she said, contributions totaled more than $142,000. But we noticed a few problems with the information she forwarded. Most of the contributions were made more than two years ago. Unterman’s staff was focusing on contributions made since 2008, they said, although some of the contributions they included dated to the 2006 election cycle. In her floor speech, the senator used the words "a two-year term." "I made a mistake," Unterman said. "I was thinking it was the last term." We noticed some of the names of the senators in Unterman’s list were not in Senate leadership, and that some of the senators currently in leadership were not included. Senate leadership includes Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the Senate’s presiding officer; David Shafer, the Senate’s president pro tem; three senators picked by Gov. Nathan Deal as his floor leaders; and three senators from the Democratic and Republican parties. Unterman said she included the names of some senators who are currently not in leadership because they served on the Senate’s Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. The bill was vetted by that committee before it came to the entire Senate, Unterman explained. Fourteen senators, including Unterman, serve on that committee. Four members of that committee are part of the official Senate leadership. During the past two calendar years, Senate leadership received about $40,000 in contributions from dentists, pharmacists and their PACs, state records show. If you go back to 2008, the total is $85,875. About one-half of those donations were made to Cagle. By law, Cagle cannot vote on any bills. Unterman said she’s received lots of money from dentists and pharmacists. Over the past two years, we found $12,200 in contributions. We found $27,500 in contributions if you go back to 2008. PolitiFact Georgia also calculated all contributions we found were made since 2008 to the current Senate leadership and to all members of the Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee except Unterman. The total was $140,375. If you add Unterman, the total is $167,875. "My whole point was to look at the amount of money put into the Gold Dome," Unterman said. "It was a lot of money." Indeed, it is. To sum up, Unterman said state Senate leaders collected $142,400 in campaign contributions from dentists and pharmacists during the past two years. Unterman told us she misspoke when she said the past two years. Her research was intended to go back to 2008. Her research included eight members of a Senate committee that is not part of the current leadership. If you include those senators, Unterman’s claim nearly hits the mark. If you exclude those senators, the claim is off by nearly 40 percent. Unterman’s dollar figure is accurate, but there’s some important context missing here. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-02063	"As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/28/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-federal-government-spending-tax-money-/	Sarah Palin’s Facebook page is a popular venue where her 4.2 million fans can track her political endorsements, follow her reality TV appearances and join in on her outrage about how the country is being run. Recently, the former GOP vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor made an "unbelievable" connection between the abuse of tax dollars and zombies. "As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not," Palin wrote May 22. "(Google it; it really is the strangest thing. It’s not like government isn't trillions in debt and wasting billions of your dollars everyday ... but I digress.)" We took her advice to heart and did some digging. After a few Internet searches and some interviews, we found this: The government does not have a plan for the zombie apocalypse. We repeat: There is no zombie apocalypse plan. "Nor do we conduct any research or know of any viruses or other conditions that would result in zombie-type behavior," said Centers for Disease Control spokesman Llelwyn Grant. That’s probably not all-too surprising given the lack of real-life zombies. But since Palin was so matter-of-fact about the plan being real, we’ll explain where she got her information. Palin’s claim is based on a public outreach strategy developed by the communications office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011. Officials aimed to grow the audience of their annual, and tired, message about preparing for hurricanes and other disasters by connecting it with a zombie apocalypse, like the one depicted in AMC’s The Walking Dead (which PolitiFact Georgia dutifully fact-checked). CDC officials created a tongue-in-cheek blog post from Dr. Ali Khan, assistant surgeon general and director of the CDC’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Khan wrote: "The rise of zombies in pop culture has given credence to the idea that a zombie apocalypse could happen. In such a scenario zombies would take over entire countries, roaming city streets eating anything living that got in their way. The proliferation of this idea has led many people to wonder 'How do I prepare for a zombie apocalypse?' "Well, we’re here to answer that question for you, and hopefully share a few tips about preparing for real emergencies too!" Khan advised people to build emergency survival kits before a zombie outbreak that include water, non-perishable food, a battery-powered radio, tools, medications, cleaning supplies, vital documents and a first-aid kit -- supplies that are key to surviving the aftermath of a hurricane or tornado. And Khan advised families to create an emergency plan detailing where to go and who to call if zombies show up, though "you can also implement this plan if there is a flood, earthquake or other emergency." Reading the screed makes clear that Khan was having fun with the zombie fascination, and that this wasn’t an actual government plan to fend off walkers. The CDC, however, does offer real tips for preparing for and responding to explosions, nuclear blasts, smallpox, Anthrax, earthquakes and other hazardous situations. Zombies didn’t make the official list. Most people realized the joke. The Atlantic bemoaned the lack of meaningful advice for effective zombie-killing weapons, hot-wiring cars, figuring out the best time of day to travel, "or really any worthwhile strategy for keeping zombies out of your house." As a PR stunt, it was pretty effective. The CDC department expected a week’s worth of attention but it stretched over a year, leading to an elaborate graphic novella generated within the agency and a "CDC Zombie Apocalypse Team" T-shirt produced by the CDC Foundation that benefited disaster and health programs. It earned a spotlight in national media, including the New York Times, CNN and Fox News, where host Bill O’Reilly dubbed the campaign one of the "dumbest things of the week." Most CDC blog posts get between 1,000 and 3,000 hits, according to a case study of the campaign for the University of Southern California. But the zombie post crashed the server after getting tens of thousands of hits, and generated more than 4.8 million page views in the two years after its launch. A chunk of the online traffic came from the agency sharing the blog post on Twitter. Palin attacked the zombie apocalypse plan (remember, not a real how-to guide) as wasting tax dollars. But this doesn’t appear to be a story about wasted stimulus grants or $16 muffins or IRS Star Trek parodies. In this case, the CDC was using an unorthodox tactic to disseminate real information. People may argue with the method, but the campaign was designed to get people prepared for real disasters. The CDC says the zombie apocalypse campaign did not require outside contractors and did not take much time. Essentially, the project cost the hours that it took to produce it by its in-house staff. We asked for more specifics but did not hear back by our deadline. Stock images of zombies cost the team $87, but there were not many initial expenses because the project was based on social media sharing, according to the USC case study, co-authored by the CDC staffer who drafted Kahn’s original blog post. When the campaign became Internet gold, the CDC spent $20,000 on posters, postcards and copies of the graphic novella for libraries, schools and scout troops, the report says. The CDC retired its zombie attack campaign, but it remains online to accommodate public interest, a spokesman told us. Officials blogged in 2012 about "teachable moments" from The Walking Dead, such as keeping your gas tank half full during an emergency and keeping a first-aid kit around to quickly treat cuts induced by rooting around rusty cars in search of abandoned gasoline. For the record, the CDC says it would take a zombie apocalypse very seriously, conducting an investigation into the disease, helping to quarantine infected citizens and sending medical teams into the field. But it’s not banking on it happening. Our ruling Palin wrote on Facebook, "As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not." People who worry about the zombie apocalypse will not be comforted to hear this, but there is no plan. The CDC played off the zombie apocalypse craze in 2011 as way to pass along real information about preparing for emergencies that don't involve zombies. They wrote up a tongue-in-cheek blog post, which successfully generated plenty of attention. So when the zombies come, you’re on your own. And Palin’s claim is False. May 28 update (2:04 p.m.): Since our fact-check first posted, our zombie friends have alerted us to some more zombie government business that we think is worth mentioning. None of it affects our rating of False. In the first case, the Washington Examiner reported on the Department of Homeland Security allowing federal government contractors to potentially be reimbursed for attending HALO Corp.'s 2012 Counter-Terrorism Summit. As part of the summit, Halo put on a "live war game of a zombie apocalypse, complete with 40 actors in full zombie makeup," the Washington Examiner reported. In the second, Foreign Policy magazine found a 2011 military training document that included plans for a zombie attack. But it’s not really a "plan." It’s part of a training exercise, the magazine reported. "The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario," Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN. "This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan."	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2014-05-28T11:10:32	2014-05-22	['None']
pomt-01927	"Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/jun/27/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-lacks-proof-wendy-davis-under-fbi-scru/	Democrats gathering in Dallas for their state convention were welcomed by a billboard featuring a photo of their gubernatorial nominee, Wendy Davis, and this message: "Wanted: Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation." It’s one of several billboards rented by the campaign of her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, according to a June 26, 2014, Abbott press release. A photo of the billboard also appeared in an Abbott campaign tweet. Davis is "wanted" by the FBI? Michelle Lee, spokeswoman in the FBI’s San Antonio office, told us by phone: "Our policy is that we don’t either confirm or deny the existence of an investigation." Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed to several April 2014 news stories as the campaign’s evidence. The reports said the FBI was investigating an agency with which Davis’ law firm has done business. FBI officials had no comment in those news stories, and a Travis County prosecutor cautioned against concluding that Davis was in federal sights. April 2014 news stories Let’s look at those reports in detail. A news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News on April 17, 2014, quoted Travis County officials as saying documents related to Davis’ work as an outside lawyer for the North Texas Tollway Authority, "are part of an FBI inquiry of the agency." That work, the story said, had related to land condemnations and delinquent toll collections. The story also touched off an Abbott campaign tweet: But, the News’ story said, it wasn’t clear whether Davis’ work for the authority "is a focus of the FBI or only part of the material collected in connection with its look into tollway agency operations." The story said the authority disclosed in 2011 that the FBI was investigating potential conflicts of interest among current and former board members. Davis, it noted, had not served on the board. Also, the story said, no one had been charged. In 2013, the story said, the Public Integrity Unit of the Travis County district attorney’s office built a file while reviewing a complaint filed by the Republican who lost to Davis for her Senate seat in 2012. Elizabeth Winn, a Travis County assistant district attorney, told the newspaper her office had confirmed with the FBI that the material from the county’s review of the complaint by Mark Shelton was now part of a federal investigation. "We did confirm by telephone … they still have a pending investigation," Winn said. The newspaper quoted Gregg Cox, who heads the county’s investigatory unit, as saying that in looking into Shelton’s complaint about Davis, his office fielded information from the FBI. "They shared information with us, and that information was in our files," Cox said. "We ultimately closed our investigation." The News said it learned of the FBI link after its request for the investigative file under the Texas Public Information Act was rebuffed by the Public Integrity Unit. The paper quoted Cox as saying: "When the open records request came in, we felt a need to protect the information in our files that we had learned from the FBI." In a September 2013, letter to Shelton, the News reported, the district attorney’s office said it had conducted legal research into his complaint against Davis but had been "unable to accumulate sufficient evidence to support a prosecution" for any offense that might have occurred in Travis County. Much of what the allegations deal with occurred elsewhere, in Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth. "Thus we do not have proper venue to prosecute any criminal conduct that occurred," the letter said. A day later, on April 18, 2014, the Austin American-Statesman followed up with a news story stating: "There is no evidence that Davis is an object of interest for the FBI, which is mum on even the question of whether there is an investigation." A Statesman news story posted online earlier that day quoted Cox as saying Shelton’s October 2012 complaint concerned the North Texas Tollway Authority hiring Davis’ law firm in exchange, Shelton asserted, for her vote on legislation that mattered to the authority. Davis, the newspaper said, had said she voted in the interests of her constituents and it had nothing to do with being given work by the authority. Cox said that, when the county embarked on looking into the matter, "we came across a bunch of news articles about the FBI investigating the NTTA so we reached out to them and they shared information with us about their investigation." The Statesman said the disclosure about the sharing of information between the Public Integrity Unit and the FBI was prompted by the Dallas newspaper’s March 11, 2014, open-records request for a copy of the case file. Travis County asked the open records division of Attorney General Abbott’s office on March 24, 2014, for a ruling, and on April 1, 2014, received an affirmative reply, confirming that it did not have to make the documents available, the Statesman said. According to the Statesman, Winn’s letter seeking the AG’s ruling said "the requested information is the subject of an open investigation" by the FBI and "the information’s release would interfere with the FBI’s prosecution of the crime underlying the information." Cox told the Statesman it would be wrong to read into the letter that Davis is a subject of the FBI investigation. Cox said the Public Integrity Unit did not provide the FBI any information; it was the FBI that provided the Public Integrity Unit with information about its investigation of the authority. We called Cox and didn’t hear back. We also asked Hirsch of Abbott’s camp how Abbott knows Davis’ work is "currently" under investigation. He didn’t say, replying by email with a question: "Has the FBI said the investigation is closed?" Our ruling Abbott’s billboard said: "Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation." That's largely unsupported. According to news reports, the FBI has looked into an agency that’s also relied on Davis for legal work--and her work may or may not be an element of the inquiry. But the FBI has been silent about the inquiry and any Davis element and we see no official confirmation otherwise of a focus on the senator. Notably, a Travis County prosecutor said two months ago it’d be wrong to conclude his office’s mention of the FBI inquiry in a letter indicates Davis is under federal scrutiny. Also, Abbott’s camp offered no evidence the declared investigation is "currently" happening. We rate this claim as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03451	A study ranked Florida "No. 1 in government corruption" under Gov. Rick Scott.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jun/20/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-link-states-no-1-corruption-rank/	Florida Democrats play up the significance of "one" in a Web video designed to get members fired up about taking on Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. A segment riffs off a clip of Scott saying, "Florida won’t stop until we’re No. 1." The words "Um, right" appear on the screen, followed by a newspaper headline typed over Scott: "Study ranks Florida No. 1 in government corruption." "No. 1 in government corruption," the text states. "Yep, Rick Scott, you’re #1 alright." Florida Republicans were not amused with the video for many reasons, taking particular issue with the corruption claim. (For the record, the clip of Scott was not of him talking about trying to make Florida No. 1 in government corruption.) We decided to check it out. Is it fair for Democrats to link Scott with the report on corrupt government officials? At issue is a study released by Integrity Florida, a nonprofit watchdog group, in June 2012. From 2000 to 2010, the study found Florida led all states in total convictions of officials and staff who broke federal public corruption laws. Florida had 781 convictions, followed by more populous states California, Texas and New York. During that time, for example, four Palm Beach County commissioners and two West Palm Beach commissioners pled guilty to corruption charges over several years, leading to it being derided as "Corruption County." Without getting into more of the nitty gritty of the report, we’ll note it included a disclaimer key to our fact-check on page 2: "The public corruption conviction data included in this report is from a time period prior to Gov. Rick Scott taking office." Integrity Florida included the line to discourage people from doing essentially what the Democrats did: misconstruing a correlation between the decade of corruption cases and Scott, who had been in office a year and a half when the report was released. "We were concerned about that kind of interpretation," Integrity Florida executive director Dan Krassner told us. The Florida Democratic Party stands by its video. Spokesman Joshua Karp directed us to a story by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald about Scott promising ethics reform with an executive order on his first day in office but not following through. Scott had pledged his administration would develop a plan for implementing "all or certain" recommendations by a grand jury convened by former Gov. Charlie Crist. "We feel that we have a strong case here given that the text of the ad is 100 percent true," Karp said, "and the fact is that Scott has not addressed the problems addressed in the report." But the video does not get into that degree of detail. It also fails to mention that Scott did sign two ethics measures into law this year. The laws give the state Commission on Ethics more power to investigate complaints referred to it, requires constitutional officers to go through four hours of ethics training and bans former legislators from lobbying state agencies for two years after leaving office, among other things. One more note: Florida is not universally considered the most corrupt state. A study by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago examined Department of Justice data for corruption convictions across the states from 1976 to 2010. The broadened time period meant Florida ranked No. 4 in total federal public corruption convictions (1,762 convictions), trailing New York, California and Illinois. Per capita, Florida ranked eighth. Our ruling The Democrats took too big a leap by blatantly linking Scott with a report about Florida being No. 1 for federal corruption convictions. The report specifically stated it was looking at the decade before Scott took office. The juxtaposition in the video is misleading, leaving viewers with the wrong impression. We rate this claim False.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-06-20T10:41:42	2013-06-16	['None']
pomt-03198	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit "unlimited carbon pollution into our air"	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/29/league-conservation-voters/sen-ron-johnson-voted-unlimited-carbon-pollution-e/	On Aug. 14, 2013 -- more than three years before U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson could face re-election -- a national environmental group hit him with an attack ad. The first-term Wisconsin Republican responded by using the TV spot to solicit political contributions. We didn’t think we’d have to go into campaign mode yet for the 2016 elections. But we’re game. In the ad, the League of Conservation Voters alleges that Johnson "has taken more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air." Johnson has received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his campaign for the 2010 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. So that is not really in dispute. Let’s see if he voted in favor of unlimited carbon pollution. Getting our bearings To be clear on terminology, we'll start with four points. 1. Global warming: The world’s leading science academies have long warned that the planet is warming. The pace has slowed in the past 15 years, although 2000 through 2009 was the warmest decade on record, according to NASA. In August 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of scientists, reiterated the role of human beings, saying in a draft report the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the main cause of the warming in recent decades. 2. Greenhouse gases: The main human-caused producer of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, which trap the Earth's heat. 3. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide makes up 84 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has determined that greenhouse gases are a threat to humans. 4. Carbon pollution: Carbon dioxide -- or carbon pollution, the term used in the ad -- comes largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Like Johnson, many congressional Republicans elected in 2010 have expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases. The ad’s evidence The Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters is "a liberal-leaning organization that raises money primarily in support of environmentally friendly public policy," according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, the five candidates who received the most money from the league -- Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin among them -- all were Democrats. To back its claim against Johnson, the League of Conservation Voters cited three Senate votes, each an amendment to a bill; one was in 2011 and two were on the same day in 2013. Two of the votes were noted in the ad and the third was cited by the league as additional evidence. 1. EPA regulations, April 6, 2011 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to an unrelated small-business bill. The amendment would have prohibited the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repealed the agency’s scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment. So, under Johnson’s vote, the EPA couldn’t regulate any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil, or by gasoline-burning vehicles. 2. Global warming, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to the 2014 federal budget bill. The amendment would have prohibited "further greenhouse gas regulations for the purposes of addressing climate change," which includes global warming. Like the earlier vote, Johnson supported the status quo: no federal limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, or carbon pollution, whether by oil and gas companies or other energy producers. 3. Carbon emissions, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for another amendment to the budget to require a vote of 60 senators in order to enact a new federal tax or fee on carbon emissions.The amendment passed. This measure doesn’t regulate carbon emissions, per se, but does make it more difficult to tax emissions. Such a tax, arguably, could lead to less production of energy that results in carbon emissions. For our purposes, the third vote really isn’t necessary in evaluating the claim against Johnson. The intent of the other two votes is clear. Johnson spokeswoman Melinda Whitemarsh Schnell told us the three votes sought to stop President Barack Obama’s administration "from passing regulations that Congress had earlier refused to enact." She also called the ad misleading because it showed smokestacks that suggested the production of electricity, and said gas and oil companies are not responsible for the carbon emissions used to make electricity. But the question here is the effect of the measures Johnson voted for. Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told us that as a practical matter, the only way to reduce carbon pollution is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel produced. But he said Johnson's votes do preserve the status quo, which has no limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Our rating The League of Conservation Voters said Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies "keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air." Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02872	Says the Affordable Care Act has already reduced the number of uninsured in Oregon by 10 percent.	true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/13/jeff-merkley/has-new-health-care-law-helped-oregon-reduce-numbe/	News that hundreds of thousands of Americans would not actually be able to keep their exact health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act has buffeted Washington. President Barack Obama and aides have had to repeatedly defend themselves against cries that they lied to the public. Obama isn’t alone, either. Anger about this revelation has turned into fodder for attacks on a number of Democrats including Oregon’s own Sen. Jeff Merkley. The Republican National Committee recently announced it had launched robocalls against the senator -- along with 10 other Democrats up for re-election -- accusing them of lying about the new law. The claim: In response, Merkley’s spokesman told The Oregonian that the law had already been extremely successful. "Merkley spokesman Matt McNally responded with a statement saying that the new law has already reduced the number of uninsured people in Oregon by 10 percent," politics reporter Jeff Mapes wrote. We’d heard that number from the Oregon Health Authority and Gov. John Kitzhaber, as well. Plus, The Oregonian had reported on it (which is where Merkley's staff got it). Given that the online application system for Cover Oregon -- the state’s health exchange under the new law -- isn’t running, we were a little suspicious. We decided to take a closer look. The analysis: Our first call was to the Oregon Health Authority, where the 10 percent figure originated. Spokeswoman Patty Wentz broke down the math for us. Some background first, though: In 2011, the Oregon Health Authority conducted an exhaustive survey that found that nearly 15 percent -- or some 560,000 Oregonians -- did not have health insurance. When the Affordable Care Act passed, Oregon was one of several states that opted to expand its Medicaid program using federal dollars. To help enroll people in this expansion, the Oregon Health Authority looked at the people receiving food stamp benefits and determined who among them would be eligible for the expansion. Under a fast-track enrollment program, those folks were prequalified. Near the end of September, about 260,000 Oregonians received a letter informing them of their eligibility along with a mail-in application. As of Oct. 18, about 56,000 Oregonians had returned the applications -- that’s about 10 percent of the total uninsured. These days, the number is closer to 70,000. Of course, we thought it was important to know whether these new enrollees would have been eligible without the Affordable Care Act. Wentz checked and explained that while a segment of those newly enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan might have previously qualified, there’s no way all of them would have been accepted into the plan because of budgetary constraints. Oregon used to have a lottery to join the plan because it had too few slots for all the folks eligible. That lottery is now gone because the slots are unlimited; if you qualify, you get in. So, it is fair to say the Affordable Care Act -- or more specifically the Oregon Health Plan expansion it enabled -- is the reason these folks will be insured come 2014. Something else occurred to us, however. If this enrollment figure was Merkley’s defense of folks not being able to keep their insurance plans, was there anybody out there who might be losing their insurance as result of the ACA? Could that number offset these gains? Cheryl Martinis with the Oregon Insurance Division filled us in on those details. She told us Oregon has about 168,000 people with individual insurance. Of those, 23,000 will keep their grandfathered plans. However, 145,000 will see their insurance plans change to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. That said, none of them will find him or herself without insurance. Instead, they’ll be moved automatically to a new plan that most closely resembles whatever it was they had before the new law. This might not be ideal, of course, but it won’t leave them without a plan. One group could be out of luck, though. Some insurance companies offer what is called a portability plan. These plans are for people who lose or drop their employer-sponsored insurance. Basically, it’s an individual policy through the same insurance company, though they generally have different benefits than what was covered under the employer’s program. Nearly 14,000 people in Oregon are on these plans, and they will not necessarily automatically be switched to new ones. So, in effect, at least some of them will be forced back into the marketplace to look for insurance. The ruling: Even if you count all of them as having lost their insurance, though, when Merkley’s staff referenced the 10 percent figure on Nov. 4, some 70,000 had received coverage through the fast-track program.

pomt-07955	Poll results from the past 35 years show that State of the Union speeches "do not move" presidential approval numbers.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/24/matthew-dowd/maureen-dowd-says-theres-no-evidence-state-union-b/	CORRECTION: The initial version of this item erroneously attributed the comment to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. With President Barack Obama about to give the State of the Union address, pundits of all stripes have been pre-analyzing and prognosticating what he may say before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 25, 2011. On the Jan. 23, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, former Republican strategist Matthew Dowd offered some historical context to how State of the Union speeches actually change public opinion -- or rather, how they do not. "To me, the State of the Union (addresses) … they don't affect the American public," Dowd said during the program’s roundtable segment. "If you look at … approval numbers going into State of the Unions over the last 35 years and coming out, they do not move the numbers. Even Ronald Reagan, who was lauded as one of the best communicators in the history of this country, never moved the American public." We thought we’d see whether Dowd was correct. While a number of media-affiliated polling organizations track presidential approval ratings, we turned to Gallup because polling experts frequently used the company’s polls for long-term studies. Gallup, which began polling before World War II, has the longest and most consistent track record of publishing such polls. Mark Blumenthal, a polling analyst who founded the website Pollster.com, published a thorough analysis of the topic in 2006. It was augmented in a 2010 study by Gallup’s own Jeffrey M. Jones. The Gallup data goes back to 1978 -- to President Jimmy Carter’s first State of the Union address -- and includes a total of 28 addresses. (Most presidents have given an address to a joint session of Congress shortly after their first inauguration, but technically these are not State of the Union addresses. Because of that, neither Blumenthal nor Jones included them in their surveys, and we won’t either.) Here’s the bottom line as Jones puts it: "A review of Gallup historical data suggests these speeches rarely affect a president's public standing in a meaningful way, despite the amount of attention they receive." By our count, presidents are actually somewhat more likely to see their polling numbers decline than see them rise after they give a State of the Union address. In all, the numbers rose 10 times, fell 15 times and remained unchanged three times. (You can see the year-by-year figures here.) Even more strikingly, the shifts were usually quite small. If you were to define a presidential "bounce" as a 5-point rise or more -- a bit outside the typical margin of error of 3 points -- then there have only been three "bounces," or about once in every 10 speeches. In fact, during the period studied, a president’s standing rose by more than 6 percentage points only once -- the 10-point rise for Bill Clinton in 1998. And that speech was somewhat exceptional, since the Monica Lewinsky scandal had just broken and Clinton used the address to refocus Americans (with some success) on his policy agenda. Clinton was the only one of the five presidents prior to Obama whose numbers rose when the poll numbers after each president's addresses were averaged together. Clinton saw his approval ratings rise by 3 points on average, while Carter and President Ronald Reagan saw their ratings drop by 1 point, President George H.W. Bush saw his ratings drop by 4 points and President George W. Bush saw his drop by 1 point. We should note that there is another type of poll taken during State of the Union season, usually with strikingly different results -- so-called "instant polls." When Gallup does these polls, they ask people who responded to a pre-State of the Union poll if they minded getting a quick call after the speech to gauge their immediate reaction. Typically, these polls show favorable results toward whoever the president is. However, Blumenthal discounts the value of these polls, citing data showing that, in most cases, viewership for the State of the Union tilts heavily toward the president’s party. "Simply put, people who don't like a particular president are considerably less apt to tune him in," he quotes ABC polling director Gary Langer as saying. Since Blumenthal’s published analysis is now five years old, we checked with him to see whether he still felt the same way. "I definitely think the argument still holds," he told us. Dowd was very close to correct that State of the Union addresses "do not move the numbers." Over the past 33 years at least, that has been the case more often than not. And the one president Dowd specifically cited, Reagan, never got a bump greater than 3 points. But there are a few exceptions, including Clinton's 10-point bounce in 1998. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Matthew Dowd	None	None	None	2011-01-24T16:17:50	2011-01-23	['None']
pomt-07504	Says "an average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/11/saxby-chambliss/senators-ring-alarm-about-4-billion-debt-problem/	Four billion dollars. Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlanta’s mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare. Here’s a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion. "An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed. Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out. The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nation’s biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta. The two senators are part of what’s been called the "Gang of Six" -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. "Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation’s staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole," they wrote. "These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities." We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers? PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money. There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates. On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day. If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem. The senators’ op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warner’s claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, it’s correct. Since the average daily debt through the first quarter of 2011 is more than $1 billion less than their statement, we rate the Chambliss claim as Mostly True.

pomt-04645	Says Sierra Club sued him to stop oil and gas activity on Texas coast, but "we won" and "the turtles are fine."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/12/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-sierra-club-sued-him-stop-gul/	Sea turtles surfaced at the state Republican convention in Fort Worth -- in a speech. State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said June 9, 2012: "I have been sued by the Sierra Club. Sued me. They wanted to stop oil and gas exploration, production, on the Texas Gulf Coast," he said. "We won. We’re producing oil and gas, and the turtles are fine." We decided to check on the oil and gas and turtles. Patterson told us by phone that he was referring to a 2002 lawsuit brought by the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club over drilling at the Padre Island National Seashore, the federal park southeast of Corpus Christi on North Padre Island that is a nesting ground for sea turtles including the endangered Kemp’s ridley. We looked up the case on the U.S. District Court website for the Southern District of Texas, where records show the suit was filed April 18, 2002, and dismissed May 7, 2003. The Sierra Club took the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal Aug. 27, 2003. The club sued the U.S. secretary of the interior, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying they had not done enough wildlife impact analysis to comply with federal laws before giving BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi permission to drill in the park. When the area became a federal park in 1962, the original private landowners and the state retained the rights to extract and profit from minerals at the site. According to the park’s website, drilling has occurred there since the 1950s. The state’s share of royalties from oil and gas goes into the Texas Permanent School Fund, an endowment established in 1876 to channel income from state lands to Texas public schools. The Sierra Club lawsuit sought an injunction to halt drilling permits until the defendants complied with the federal laws the club claimed were broken. The district court, however, found that the government had sufficiently investigated the impact of drilling and operation on the turtles, and the appeals court affirmed that decision. So, was Patterson sued, as he says? We realized he could not have been one of the parties originally sued in 2002 -- he wasn’t even elected land commissioner until November 2002. Rather, court records and our phone interview with Patterson spokesman Jim Suydam showed that in his role as land commissioner, Patterson filed to intervene in the suit Jan. 14, 2003. After that, according to the court documents and an April 19, 2003, Associated Press news story, Patterson was listed as a defendant in the suit. According to the appeals court summary, the district court said government had not shirked its duties in estimating the effect drilling would have on the turtles, noting that the Park Service’s March 2001 oil and gas management plan spelled out restrictions and mitigation requirements. The plan’s 16 pages of drilling/production requirements include measures such as having turtle-spotting monitors precede heavy equipment being driven along the beach and shielding light sources so turtles would not become disoriented. The courts’ dismissals of both the lawsuit and the club’s appeal amounted to victory for the government, or as Patterson said, "We won." And how about those turtles? Texas’ coast once had many. According to a news story in the June 2012 issue of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s magazine, canneries nearly wiped out the Texas green turtle population after the Civil War. The department’s website said the turtles were hit hard again from the 1940s to 1960s by people gathering and selling "truckloads" of eggs. Today, the story said, the shrimping industry is the biggest threat. Sea turtles must surface to breathe; if they’re trapped below water in a net, they will drown. "All species in Texas waters — leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead, green and Kemp’s ridley — are listed as either threatened or endangered," the story said. The Parks and Wildlife website said Kemp’s ridleys are the most endangered sea turtle species in the world. In a U.S.-Mexico program from 1978-88, Kemp’s ridley eggs from a turtle sanctuary in Tamaulipas were brought to Padre to hatch, "imprinting" the baby turtles to return there for nesting, according to the story, which also said, "All along the Texas coast, scientists and advocates have dedicated their careers to sea turtle research and protection." According to news stories dating from 2002 through August 2012 that we found using the Nexis news database, since 1996, turtle nest counts on the Texas coast have risen almost every year. Texas’ growing colony of Kemp’s ridleys now serves as a backup of sorts -- if disaster struck the Tamaulipas sanctuary, the species might not be wiped out. Carole Allen, Gulf office director with the nonprofit Sea Turtle Restoration Project, told us by email that she believes the major reasons for rising turtle numbers are increased protection of the turtles in Tamaulipas and the requirement of turtle excluder devices on U.S. shrimp boats. The devices, called TEDs, provide a grill of bars in a trawl net that large sea creatures can fit through; shrimpers, however, sometimes sew nets together again to counteract that escape hatch. In its 2002 lawsuit, the Sierra Club described ways that oil and gas operations could harm turtles, but included no measurement of harm occurring. We checked with the club’s lead volunteer in the lawsuit, Pat Suter, who chairs the Corpus Christi chapter. She told us by phone, "As far as I know, there has not been direct impact on the turtles that can be proved." Sierra said in its suit that trucks traveling to and from the well site would threaten turtles. The news articles we reviewed included no reports of turtles hurt or discouraged from nesting by oil and gas rigs, trucks, drilling or pumping at the federal park. Separately, an April 15, 2004, "white paper" on the park’s website said, "There has been vehicle traffic, from both visitors and heavy equipment operators, on the Gulf of Mexico shoreline for over fifty years with no documented case of a crushing of a nesting sea turtle within the park." Allen told us, "My personal opinion is that everything is being done to protect nesting sea turtles and hatchlings from being run over at the National Seashore. Kemp's ridleys are in far more danger from law-breaking shrimpers." As we closed out this check, Suydam conceded that Patterson was not sued by the Sierra Club. "It looks like Commissioner Patterson misspoke there," Suydam said. "He intervened in the Sierra Club's lawsuit, and then became a defendant." Still, Suydam said, "The sentiment is true. When the Sierra Club sues to stop oil and gas exploration, it is in effect suing to limit oil and gas production on Permanent School Fund lands," which is Patterson’s responsibility. Our ruling The Sierra Club did not sue Patterson; he wasn’t quite land commissioner when the group filed its suit against federal agencies. Still, he later joined the lawsuit, which the government won. And, despite ongoing oil and gas activity at the park in accord with the 1962 terms, Texas’ threatened and endangered sea turtles are increasing in numbers. We rate Patterson’s statement as Half True.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2012-09-12T12:00:00	2012-06-09	['Texas']
pomt-00966	In states that have private-sale background checks for handguns "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/16/lori-haas/haas-says-fewer-women-killed-guns-states-expanded-/	Closing a loophole in state law that allows some Virginians to buy firearms without going through a background check is a matter of life and death to women, according to Lori Haas, state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Haas was among a number of gun control advocates who spoke at a news conference last month in favor of a series of bills aimed at tightening state firearm laws. Haas has compelling experience with gun violence: Her daughter, Emily, was grazed twice in the head during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Her brief remarks touched on background check laws. All states require licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check before selling a firearm to make sure the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record or disqualifying mental condition. But Virginia and 32 other states don’t require background checks for firearms bought through an unlicensed seller -- someone who isn’t in the routine business of selling guns. Haas backed a bill that would have narrowed that exception. In states that run background checks for privately-sold handguns, "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed," she said. Since Haas spoke, the General Assembly has scuttled major gun control bills, including the loophole closer. But background checks for all gun buyers is a perennial issue before the legislature and we wondered whether Haas’ statement was correct in terms of the number she used and the cause and effect of background check laws on women’s lives. She told us the figure came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The numbers The group issued a report last September examining firearm homicides of women by intimate partners -- current and former husbands, as well as boyfriends. It found that from 2008-2012, the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales when compared with the rest of the nation. Stacey Radnor, a spokeswoman with Everytown, said the group also found that the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark -- only 4.3 percent lower in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns. We should note, however, that Haas’ statement focused on a broader definition of victims. She cited "women" without any reference to whether they were domestic violence victims. So to examine her exact statement, we needed to find figures on gun murders deaths of all women, which are not in Everytown’s report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles fatality data based on information from death certificates filed in each state. We looked at the 14 states that had background checks on private handgun sales during the 5-year period Everytown references. Those states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Three other states have in recent years added private-sale background checks: Colorado, Delaware and Washington. We found those firearms homicide figures of women for all but three states with small populations -- Rhode Island (which requires a background check for private handgun sales) as well as Vermont and Wyoming (which do not). The CDC withholds the number of firearms homicides of women in those states because they are so few in number. But given the small size of each state’s population, it wouldn’t affect the overall trend line for the 47 other states where the information was available. We found that in states with private-sale background checks, the rate of firearm homicides of females age 18 and over was 1.0 per 100,000 women. In the states that didn’t extend background checks to private handgun sales, the homicide rate was 1.6 per 100,000 women in that age group. That means there were 38 percent fewer firearms homicides of women in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns than the rest of the nation, lower than Haas’ statistic but still a significant figure. In Virginia, the rate was 1.4 per 100,000 women. We should note some states without background checks on all handgun sales bucked the trend of lower firearms violence against females. Minnesota, which has no requirement for background checks on private handgun sales, had a rate of 0.6 firearms homicides for every 100,000 women. That was one-third the rate of North Carolina, which requires a background check of anyone seeking to buy a handgun. Cause and effect Two analysts we contacted urged caution in interpreting a correlation in lower rates of gun violence to private-sale background checks. "Making causal claims is always riskier," Jacquelyn White, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, said in an email. "States that require background checks may also be more likely to support other efforts that contribute to the well-being of their residents. Remember, correlation is not causation. There may be other factors, such as a more enlightened commitment to creating healthy and safe communities, that result in an array of programs and policies that reduce domestic violence." Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, said Everytown’s figure "takes no other account of any other factors that affect homicides." "States do not randomly pass gun laws -- those that pass gun laws are different in many ways from those that do not," Kleck, who has studied the impact of background checks on homicide rates, said in an email. "For obvious political reasons, it’s easier to enact stricter gun laws in states with fewer gun-owning voters. Thus, states that extended background checks to private gun transfers had lower gun ownership rates even before those laws were passed. Likewise, states with stricter gun laws are more urban, less likely to be Southern or Western (and thus culturally different), more politically liberal etc. You can’t isolate the effect of a gun law without controlling for other violence-related factors." Our ruling Haas said in states with comprehensive background checks for handguns, "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed." She supports that statement by pointing to figures examining a narrower group of female firearms victims -- those killed in domestic violence situations. But figures examining the broader group of victims she cited in her statement -- women in general -- show 38 percent fewer women were shot and killed in the states with private-sale background checks on handgun sales. That’s not quite high as the figure she cited, but it still represents a lower rate of gun homicides of women in states with comprehensive background checks. But experts cautioned against reading too much into that correlation. They noted that there may be other factors beyond background checks that led to that result. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-08577	Says Zack Space voted for budgets and debt, energy taxes and the stimulus, and "we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/americans-job-security/americans-job-security-targets-zach-space-other-de/	A new political ad shows a burglar climbing into a window, taking someone's wallet, and driving off in their car. "What would it feel like if someone broke into your home?" The narrator asks. "Would you be upset? Then what about what's happening in Washington? Zack Space voted for Nancy Pelosi's budgets and debt, for job-killing energy taxes, and for her wasteful stimulus. And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs. With Pelosi and Space's agenda, it can feel like you're getting robbed. This November, vote against Zack Space." The ad comes from Americans for Job Security, a conservative anti-tax group. The group does not disclose its donors, and that has led to questions about who funds the group and for what purposes. The ad, called "Robbed," is part of an ad buy against several Democratic candidates around the country. The ad targets Space of Ohio, Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire and Democratic challengers Bryan Lentz of Pennsylvania and Trent Van Haaften of Indiana. For Lentz and Van Haaften, the ad says that each candidate "wants to join Nancy Pelosi," and then lists the measures as "Pelosi's agenda." The ad mentions major pieces of legislation passed by Democrats in Congress and labels them a failure because "we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs." Take away the scary robber imagery, and it's a fairly straightforward claim. We decided to fact-check the ad for Space, who represents eastern Ohio and is a member of the Blue Dog coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats. We'll take the ads' claims about him in order. • Space "voted for budgets and debt." Space did vote for the 2010 budget, a vote that in the U.S. House of Representatives was mostly along party lines, 233-193. (Seventeen Democrats voted with Republicans in opposition.) One might argue that the budget is more President Barack Obama's than Nancy Pelosi's -- the president proposes the budget, and Congress votes on it. But Pelosi, as speaker of the House, leads the Democrats, who overwhelmingly approved the budget. But the ad gets it wrong on Space's vote on "debt." Here, the ad cites a vote from December 2009 that permitted the national debt limit to increase from $12.1 trillion to $12.39 trillion. The vote in this case was 218 to 214, with 39 Democrats joining all the Republicans. In this case, Space voted with the Republicans and against raising the debt limit. So the ad gets this point wrong. • Space voted for "job-killing energy taxes." This is Americans for Job Security's way of saying that Space voted for major energy legislation (Republicans lately have been fond of putting "job-killing" in front of many things the Democrats support.) But as we've pointed out before, the legislation was for a cap-and-trade system, not an energy tax. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Presumably, the costs associated with that end up getting passed on to consumers. PolitiFact Ohio looked into this issue previously, when Republican candidate Bob Gibbs attacked Space for voting for the legislation, saying the measure would cost the average household "approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates." We found that number to be a wild exaggeration, based on estimates that were not part of the bill that Space voted for. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. And whether the measure is job-killing is also a contested issue. Some say it will actually create jobs, and there's a lively debate on the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that employment rates would be "slightly lower" if cap-and-trade passes. Here, we'll note that Space did vote for the cap-and-trade legislation, but calling it a "energy tax" is not an accurate way to describe the measure. • Space voted for a "wasteful stimulus." Again, Space did vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, popularly known as the economic stimulus. Whether it was "wasteful" is still a matter for debate at this point. (We've done many fact-checks on the stimulus, read them all here.) We should point out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released new estimates on Aug. 24, 2010, that the stimulus added between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs to the economy, compared with not having any stimulus. Still, the economy was in such bad shape that overall employment declined anyway, as we'll see in the next point. • "And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs." To check this jobs number, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Given the ad's content, we think it's fair to start counting from about the time the stimulus passed to today. There are several different ways to calculate employment numbers, so we decided to look at two measures. Both supported the ads' claim. First, we looked at total employment, the number of workers in the United States. It was 132.8 million in February 2009, and 130.4 million in June 2010. (June is the most recent month with final numbers; data for July and August are still preliminary.) That's a difference of 2.4 million workers, very close to the ad's statement. If you look at only private employment, there were 110.3 million people employed in February 2009 and 107.7 million employed in June 2010. That's a difference of 2.6 million people. So the ad's claim on jobs lost since the Democrats passed their legislation is accurate. In deciding upon a Truth-O-Meter ruling for this ad, we had a lot to consider on the many different points the ad raises. The ad's bottom line is that the Democrats passed legislation that Space voted for, and overall employment still declined. But the ad gets some of its details wrong, most notably Space's vote on increasing the debt ceiling. That point is flat-out wrong. The ad also mischaracterizes cap-and-and trade legislation as an energy tax. Space did vote for cap-and-trade, the 2010 budget and the stimulus. Given the ad's inaccuracies, we rate its statement Half True.	None	Americans for Job Security	None	None	None	2010-09-27T12:07:26	2010-09-23	['None']
pomt-05891	"If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/07/chain-email/home-sales-tax-e-mail-surfaces-again/	"THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!" said the message that arrived in our e-mail box on Feb. 2, which warned of a "ploy to steal billions from unsuspecting homeowners." "Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it?" the e-mails says. "That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc." the e-mail says, adding that "under the new health care bill, all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax." The e-mail, circulating now in Rhode Island, directs recipients to GOP.gov, "the Website of the Republican majority in Congress." It also encourages recipients to forward the message to everyone in their address books. It turns out that versions of this e-mail have been around for a few years, sparked by a provision in the new health care law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare, that is designed to cover some costs of the program. In April 2010, Snopes.com declared it False and FactCheck.org determined that it was bogus, a massive misstatement of a tax that would fall on relatively few people. And one year ago, national PolitiFact gave it a Pants on Fire because it was so deceptive. Because the e-mail has gotten new life in Rhode Island, we thought we’d remind people about the facts behind this claim. First of all, the 3.8-percent tax the e-mail cites, due to take effect next year, doesn't apply to taxpayers making less than $200,000 in the year of the sale. (The limit for couples is $250,000 in adjusted gross income.) Any profit from the house sale is not included in the income calculation. This limitation alone excludes the vast majority of homeowners. The nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation estimated in 2010 that this provision alone would make the new tax irrelevant to about 98 percent of families. It would only apply to those with the highest incomes. Next, it isn’t a sales tax at all, because it applies only to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself. Third, if the property you're selling is your primary residence -- and not a second home, vacation home or rental property -- you can turn a profit of $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) before the tax kicks in. In addition, the tax is assessed only on the amount of profit that exceeds that limit. (The median sale price for a home in the U.S. was $164,500 in December, 2011, one big reason why the vast majority of Americans won't be affected by the tax.) (Other property, such as that second home, would incur the tax, but, again, your basic income has to be high enough for you to be hit.) The 3.8-percent tax is in addition to the existing capital gains tax that must be paid now. That rate is generally 15 percent. So consider a couple who sells their home for $1 million after buying it many years ago for $100,000. If they earn $249,000 that year, they will pay no new tax. If they earn $251,000, they will be taxed. Although the profit on the home sale will be $900,000, the first $500,000 is not taxed. They will have to pay 3.8 percent on the remaining $400,000, in addition to the usual capital gains tax. The National Association of Realtors (Realtor.org) has an 11-page booklet, "The 3.8% Tax; Real Estate Scenarios & Examples," that outlines various scenarios and shows who will need to worry about the tax. Our ruling The chain e-mail claim that "if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax" is untrue on so many levels as to be ridiculous. It's not a sales tax because it doesn't apply to the full sale price of the home, only the profit made in the sale. It's not going to apply to the vast majority of Americans, only those whose income is more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples). It's not going to apply to most people selling their home because they won't be getting $250,000 more than they paid for it ($500,000 for couples). Because the e-mail wildly misrepresents one aspect of the new health care law, we rate it Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-02355	Millions of Americans are "paying more and getting less" under Obamacare.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/20/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-claims-people-are-getting-les/	Americans for Prosperity has been active on the airwaves already this election cycle. The group, which opposes Obamacare, has run a handful of ads featuring people telling health care "horror stories" meant to tug on the heartstrings. We’ve looked at a couple and explained how they can be misleading. But a pair of new ads take an entirely different tack to undercut support from Democratic Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Udall of Colorado. (It has also run against Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., and Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark.) In these ads, a woman on screen trashes political ads in her 30-second personal pitch. "People don’t like political ads. I don’t like them either. But health care isn’t about politics," she says. "It’s about people. And millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can’t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less." We’ve tackled claims about lost insurance and access to personal doctors before. But we haven’t heard someone say that the health care law is causing people to pay more for less, so we decided to check it out. Paying more There are a lot of factors in the health care law — and health insurance in general — that make it difficult to pin down whether people are paying more or less for coverage. In general, insurance premiums were increasing every year well before Obamacare became law. In fact, rates have increased consistently during the last 15 years. But there are signs that the rate of the increase has declined since the law was passed. Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, surveyed people who purchase insurance through their employer. Here are the average annual cost of premiums: Year Single % increase Family % increase 1999 $2,196 $5,791 2000 $2,471 12.52% $6,438 11.17% 2001 $2,689 8.82% $7,061 9.68% 2002 $3,083 14.65% $8,003 13.34% 2003 $3,383 9.73% $9,068 13.31% 2004 $3,695 9.22% $9,950 9.73% 2005 $4,024 8.90% $10,880 9.35% 2006 $4,242 5.42% $11,480 5.51% 2007 $4,479 5.59% $12,106 5.45% 2008 $4,704 5.02% $12,680 4.74% 2009 $4,824 2.55% $13,375 5.48% 2010 $5,049 4.66% $13,770 2.95% 2011 $5,429 7.53% $15,073 9.46% 2012 $5,615 3.43% $15,745 4.46% 2013 $5,884 4.79% $16,351 3.85% Other than a sharp increase between 2010 to 2011, the Obama years have experienced the smallest rate increases of the last 14 years. Throughout much of the early 2000s, premium increases of 9 percent or more were the norm. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid also found a slowdown in the increase in health costs during the last four years, including a modest 4 percent increase from 2011 to 2012. The government attributed the decrease in health costs to the economic downturn. Kaiser, too, said the recession accounted for much of the decline, though they said the health care law may have played a role, too. Because of the law, people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for subsidies to buy insurance, and for many of them, costs are going down. Those costs are capped at a percent of their income. But some people may see rate increases on existing policies or as they transition to new plans. Insurers can no longer deny individuals with pre-existing conditions, and there is now a much larger pool of people looking to purchase coverage. For younger, healthier people, this means they are now taking on some of the financial burden so older or sick people can buy insurance at a reasonable price. (This is especially true for young males, since young women were often charged more, and even more so if they don’t qualify for premium subsidies.) There were also people who previously purchased very cheap plans. But those policies provided very little coverage or capped their benefits at low levels, which the new health care law bars. So they’re getting more coverage, albeit at a greater cost. Getting less? Which gets us to our next point. We found it strange that the ad claimed that people are getting less under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, we’ve usually heard the opposite from critics of the law that people are now paying for types of coverage they don’t need. The favorite example is single men who now will now have maternity coverage if they buy a plan on the individual market. In October 2013, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., grilled Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on this very point. "An insurance policy has a series of benefits whether you use them or not," Sebelius said during her testimony on the Hill. "And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high," Ellmers said. "We’re forcing them to buy things that they will never need." "Individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families," Sebelius responded. "To the best of your knowledge, has a man ever delivered a baby?" Elmers asked. The discussion ended there. So are you getting less coverage, or getting more than you need? We asked Americans for Prosperity to clarify their position. "Getting less speaks to a multitude of data points that has been America's Obamacare experience so far: botched website, shrinking provider networks, a string of broken promises, missed deadlines, and unilateral rule changes that have kept the entire country in limbo ever since this debacle rolled out," said spokesman Levi Russell. That’s a pretty ambiguous definition of "less." We think most people would assume "less" is referring to the amount of coverage or benefits under the law. Americans are getting more benefits under the law in a number of ways -- including, in some cases, being able to buy affordable insurance for the first time. In addition, insurance purchased in the individual and small group marketplace must meet 10 essential health benefits. This includes coverage for emergency services and hospitalization, prescription drugs, free preventative coverage for things ranging from basic immunizations to HIV screening, and maternity care. The law also caps out-of-pocket costs, providing greater protection from exorbitant hospital bills. The most a person could pay for health care in a year is $6,300; the most a family can pay is $12,600. Before the law passed, some insurers capped annual or lifetime benefits, forcing people who thought they were covered to pay large hospital bills once they passed the threshold. People with pre-existing conditions are also seeing a lot more benefits, since they previously couldn’t buy a policy at all. So it’s a tough sell to say millions are getting less. And for many, they aren’t paying more, either. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said "millions are paying more and getting less" under Obamacare. We found their explanation of "less" rather dubious. Most people on the individual market are getting more benefits under the law. At worst, they’re paying more to get more, though in many cases they’re actually paying less. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11983	"We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have paid maternity leave."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/28/claire-mccaskill/us-only-developed-nation-without-mandated-paid-mat/	Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill hosted dozens of town halls throughout the state in August. She made several bold statements during her visits with constituents, but one claim caught our attention. "We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have paid maternity leave," McCaskill said on Aug. 22, 2017 at a town hall in Monett, Missouri. Last year, PolitiFact rated a similar statement by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as Mostly True, but a lot can change in year. So we decided McCaskill’s statement was worth a follow-up. The most frequently used measure of determining a developed country is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to University of Missouri Associate law professor Sam Halabi. The United States became a member of the OECD in 1961, and is now one of 35 member countries. As of 2016, the United States had the third highest GDP per capita in the world. Sarah Feldman, a spokesperson for Sen. McCaskill, cited last year’s fact-check on Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as evidence. "Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand made the same statement, with a few small differences: ‘industrial’ vs. ‘developed’ and ‘paid family leave’ vs. ‘paid maternity leave,’" Feldman said. "Maternity leave is a subset of paid family leave, so if a country has paid family leave it would have maternity leave as well." Maternity leave in the U.S. The United States ranks dead last in a study conducted by the OECD on the national paid maternity leave policies of its member countries. The average amount of paid leave time for mothers among its members was a little over one year, as of 2016. Mexico comes in second-to-last place. Though there are some United States companies that provide paid maternity leave for employees, like Etsy, Ikea and Twitter, there is no national mandate. The Family and Medical Leave Act requires that mothers have a minimum of 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. California, Rhode Island and New Jersey are the only states with paid maternity leave mandates, and New York will join them beginning in 2018. But California and New Jersey only require six weeks of partial income replacement, and Rhode Island only requires four weeks of 60 percent income replacement. That’s nowhere near what some countries mandate that employers provide. Jessica Ciccone, St. Louis University School of Law director of communications, worked with Missouri Sen. Jill Schupp on Senate Bill 69, which would have created a state family and medical leave program this past legislative session. Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order providing paid maternity leave for the executive branch and encouraging the legislature to pass a similar measure. Ciccone cited an International Labour Organization study, which found Papua New Guinea and the United States are the only two of the 185 countries and territories reported in the study that do not provide paid maternity leave. Papua New Guinea is not considered an industrialized nation. Our ruling Senator McCaskill said the United States is the only developed nation without paid maternity leave. Based on OECD and ILO data, the United States is the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave. Yet, as previously reported in PolitiFact, some nations with paid maternity leave exclude certain groups of workers, meaning it isn’t quite universal. In the same sense, the United States has some states that do mandate paid maternity leave and parents can take unpaid time off after a child is born or adopted, although there isn’t a national law. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2017-09-28T16:17:31	2017-08-22	['None']
pomt-14651	Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/22/jeff-judson/texas-has-sixth-highest-property-taxes-nation/	Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio faces two opponents in the March 2016 Republican primary, including Jeff Judson, a former San Antonio Tea Party director who is citing his record of "fighting for low taxes and limited government" in his campaign to represent District 121. A Dec.1, 2015, post on the Conservatives in Action blog quoted Judson saying, "Texas has the 6th-highest property taxes in the country even though we have very conservative state officials, but not municipal officials." Judson made the statement as a criticism of Straus' leadership. Texans are probably not paying the nation’s highest total taxes. According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, in 2012 Texas ranked 46th in state-local taxes per resident. Still, Judson made us wonder if Texas property taxes are comparatively steep. From the top, we noticed a couple of considerations distinguishing Texas. Property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states, Texas levies no state personal income tax. Notably too, unlike in some states, Texas property tax rates are set locally, not by the state, according to the Texas comptroller. That’s because the state lacks the constitutional authority to levy a property tax, according to the Texas Legislative Council. Generally under the current system, a county appraisal district does an annual property valuation, then each area city, county, school and special district (like hospital and road districts) set the respective tax rate necessary to raise the money needed to fund the related adopted budget. And according to U.S. Census Bureau data, property taxes in 2013, the latest year of available data, were the source of 81.6 percent of local tax revenue in Texas (the national average for this figure was 46.7 percent). When we asked Judson how he reached his Texas ranking, he directed us to an Aug. 13, 2015, post on his Facebook page that cited a blog post published that day by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on national, state and local tax policy. The foundation tends to argue for lower tax rates under the premise that, as a 2015 foundation report put it, " a state with lower tax costs will be more attractive to business investment and more likely to experience economic growth." The foundation’s August 2016 post, drawing on 2013 Census data, calculated and mapped the average amount of residential property tax paid as a percentage of home value state by state; the Texas rate proved lower only than those of New Jersey, Illinois, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Wisconsin and higher than the rates in the other 44 states. According to the post, written by Tax Foundation policy analyst Jared Walczak, the calculation only considered taxes on owner occupied-housing, not property taxes paid by businesses and those passed along from landlords to renters. So, according to the foundation’s calculations of home property taxes as a share of home values, property taxes in Texas in 2013 were the nation’s sixth-highest, as Judson said. Mindful the foundation looked at average residential taxes, we wondered about taking into account the variety of property values and tax rates around Texas. Were average rates alone fairly representative? Maybe so. A 2013 report on property taxes from the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, notes that in general, "most of the variation (in property tax burdens) is due to variation across rather than within states;" however, the researchers found that Texas was among three states with the most variation in property tax levels as a share of home prices. Another analysis We wondered how organizations other than the Tax Foundation went about comparing property taxes across the country. Texas advocates including Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities and Dale Craymer of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association suggested we consider a 2015 comparison study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy which calculates the rates of four different types of property taxes in the biggest city in each state, a rural city in each state, plus the country’s 50 largest cities overall. The report’s rankings suggest that Texas’s biggest cities (especially Houston, San Antonio, El Paso and Fort Worth) have had some of the highest urban homestead property taxes, industrial property taxes and apartment property taxes compared to large cities in other states. But what about on the county level? In some counties, like Jeff Davis, Pecos, Zapata, Starr, and Mason, homeowners paid less than 1 percent of their home value in annual property taxes from 2007 to 2011, while in Wilson, Bastrop and Travis counties, homeowners paid more than 1.5 percent of home values annually, according to the report. Residents of Bexar and Harris counties paid over 2 percent of their home values in property taxes in that period, according to Census data. The disparity between counties also comes through in real-dollar terms, although measures of taxes in terms of dollars paid can be distorted by the difference in home prices from county to county. Another map from the Tax Foundation used real dollar amounts and illustrates just how much property taxes can vary from county to county. This one estimates the property tax burden using IRS data on the amount of real estate taxes people declare on their taxes. The counties paying the most in dollar values are Travis ($7,553), Kendall ($6,916) and Fort Bend ($6,813), while those paying the least are Dickens ($1,325), Stonewall ($1,425) and Hudspeth ($1,450). Lavine, asked how best to compare taxes between different jurisdictions within and across state lines, suggested we consider the share of personal income paid in taxes. Using IRS Statistics of Income data to calculate a rough average amount of real estate taxes paid as a percentage of average income reveals huge differences from county to county -- residents of Crane County pay as little as 2.9% of their income by this metric, while in Dallas County, it’s closer to 13.9% -- a large spread. So there’s a great deal of variation in the property tax rate within Texas whether it’s measured in percentage of income, percentage of home value, or raw dollar amounts. Yet another factor to think about when considering the property tax burden for the average Texan is the rate of home ownership. The Tax Foundation map Judson cited considered the percentage of home value that’s paid in property taxes on owner-occupied housing, but only 62.7% of housing in Texas is owner-occupied. Texas had the ninth-lowest rate of homeownership in the nation from 2010 to 2014, according to Census Bureau data. But lest one think property taxes are paid only by the rich, it should be noted that while the property tax burden in Texas is not necessarily shouldered by every taxpayer, it consumes a fairly equal percentage of family income across earning groups. The lowest 20% of earners pay 3.8% of their income in property taxes, the next quintile pays 2.8%, the middle quintile pays 2.6%, the fourth quintile pays 2.8%, the next 15% pays 3.2%, the next 5% pays 3.1%, and the top 1% pays 2.1%, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Because so much is determined on the local level, it’s worth noting that state legislation is limited in its ability to reduce the property tax burden, even through expanding exemptions. Although an amendment expanding exemptions for school district property taxes was approved by voters in November 2015, an analysis by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee found that such legislation was unlikely to lower property tax bills for many homeowners because increasing home values will offset whatever relief is provided by the legislation. Our Ruling Jeff Judson, in a criticism of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, said Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation. While it may be true that on average, Texas property taxes are the sixth-highest in the nation, the actual taxpayer burden on state residents varies hugely from county by county, making the average less representative. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-03297	"The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, did an analysis and said that passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce the federal deficit by $200 billion over the next decade."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/01/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-passing-senate-approve/	For many people, creating a path to citizenship for individuals who came into the United States illegally seems counterproductive. But U. S. Rep. David Cicilline says that it makes economic sense. During an appearance from Washington on the WPRI-TV program "Newsmakers," which aired July 21, Cicilline said passing the bipartisan immigration bill already approved by the Senate would save the country billions. "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, did an analysis and said that passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce the federal deficit by $200 billion over the next decade," said Cicilline. Roughly $20 billion per year? When we inquired, Cicilline's office sent a link to the CBO report. It does indeed offer that as an estimate. The actual projected savings: $197 billion from 2014 to 2023. The legislation would increase the deficit in 2014 by $2.5 billion but beginning in 2015, as new income and payroll tax revenues from the new workers start accumulating, it would cut away at the deficit by an ever-increasing amount, according to the budget office, starting at $4.7 billion and shaving as much as $55.9 billion in the final year of the projection. The savings will come despite the government having to pay an additional $82 billion over 10 years for health insurance subsidies, $29 billion for Medicaid for adults and children, $6 billion more for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly known as food stamps) and $5.1 billion more for unemployment insurance. Why the savings? Passage of the law would increase federal revenues by $459 billion from 2014 to 2023, the report said. "That increase would stem largely from additional collections of income and payroll taxes, reflecting both an increase in the size of the U.S. labor force and changes in the legal status of some current workers." The report estimates that passing the immigration proposal would increase the number of permanent U.S. residents by 10.4 million and the number of temporary workers and their dependents by 1.6 million. (There would also be 1.6 million fewer unauthorized residents.) During that time, none of the immigrants who entered the country illegally would be eligible for Social Security or Medicare. And after that? The CBO estimated that immigration reform would reduce the deficit by $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, but those longer-range projections are less certain. PolitiFact usually doesn't offer rulings on predictions such as the ones in the CBO report. But we can say that Cicilline is correctly quoting the federal nonpartisan report. We rate the claim True.

pomt-08300	Says John Raese said he wants "1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/31/joe-manchin/lasers-sky-military-trying-it/	An ad from Joe Manchin, the Democratic candidate for Senate in West Virginia, uses a Star Wars theme to target his opponent as "Darth Raese." (Watch it before George Lucas' lawyers hear about it.) The Web ad shows video of John Raese, the Republican candidate, making these statements: "We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now." "I'm in the business of not providing jobs, I'm in the business of making money." "I don't agree with minimum wage." "We don't need the Department of Education." Manchin then uses a hunting rifle to shoot down a TIE fighter. (Not kidding!) The ad concludes, "No more crazy John Raese ideas." Raese does oppose the minimum wage, on the grounds that the free market should set wages; he recently defended that view in a candidates' debate. He also thinks the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished, because states and counties should run schools. His comment on business was a strong defense of the profit motive in running a business. But we were perplexed by his comment, "We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now." Manchin's ad provides it without context, as if Raese is calling for construction of the Death Star. So we decided to check into it. We tracked the comments back to an NBC News report about comments Raese made at a voters' forum sponsored in part by the tea party movement. Here's a fuller version of what he said (watch the video): "I want to put in a strategic defense initiative in this country that will take care of us and our friends ... Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as Star Wars: We need to bring it back," Raese said, referring to a defense program proposed by President Ronald Reagan. He said the U.S. should not negotiate with countries like Iran. He also made fun of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name while the audience laughed. "What you do with them is you put them on notice that we have a defense system in our country that is the best, the best. Right now, any nuclear weapon launched from North Korea can hit Alaska and can almost hit California," he said. "We are sitting with the only technology in the world that works, and it's laser technology. We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now. That is (of) paramount importance," he said. The Raese campaign confirmed the extended remarks and pointed us to two opinion pieces by The Heritage Foundation that advocate missile defense, which means developing ways to intercept and destroy in-flight missiles launched by hostile forces. That would primarily be done by anti-ballistic missiles, but there's also been considerable research into Reagan's proposal to use some type of lasers. The pieces note correctly that Reagan was a strong supporter of missile defense. In recent years, President George W. Bush supported a long-range missile defense shield in Poland. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, scrapped the Bush administration plan in favor of a system designed to down short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran. So the "1,000 laser systems put in the sky" is a reference to a longer-term plan for missile defense that presumably would use lasers instead of missiles (hence, the "Star Wars" theme.) If you think using lasers for missile defense is fanciful, we should point out that the military is actively studying the use of lasers to knock missiles out of the sky. The technology remains controversial, though, because some military officials believe it hasn't really worked and is too expensive. In a test on Oct. 23, 2010, a jumbo jet outfitted with a laser gun failed to knock a test missile out of the sky as part of the Airborne Laser Test Bed program. In May 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Congress that he wanted to continue funding prototype testing as part of basic research, but that it was not realistic to use anti-missile lasers any time soon. Gates said a basic program near Iran, for example, would require 10 to 20 jets costing $1.5 billion each, plus hundreds of millions in operating expenses. "And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept," he added. Getting back to the Manchin video, Raese may have been speaking a little hyperbolically about putting "1,000 lasers systems in the sky." Clearly, the Manchin campaign could have used a more straightforward quote to indicate what Raese was talking about, but they cherry-picked a quote that sounded the most nutty. You can support or oppose a missile defense shield, but this ad gives a distorted view of Raese's position. In fact, we couldn't even figure it out at first. We're not sure what West Virginia voters will make of it. Still, Raese clearly supports beefing up efforts at laser-based missile defense. So we rate Manchin's statement Half True.

pomt-10162	"John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/john-mccain/fannie-freddie-and-john-at-odds-in-2006/	Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled a new advertisement saying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. "John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms," McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill. Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting, the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. "If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," he said in a statement . The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed onto the bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And he reportedly didn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he "fought" for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate. We give his claim a Half True.

pomt-07418	"The Georgia Lottery Corp. has only once in the past 16 years paid out the agreed upon 35 percent of proceeds to the account which funds the HOPE scholarship."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/27/allie-mccullen/luck-runs-out-student-lottery-claim/	With the cost of higher education rising every year, some students probably think they need to win the lottery to afford tuition. But others -- math majors probably -- believe there’s a more likely way for the Georgia Lottery Corp. to help students pay their bills. Student organizations along with some state lawmakers have called on the corporation, the quasi-governmental entity that runs the game, to provide a higher percentage of its proceeds to the HOPE scholarship fund. Last month Georgia Students for Public Higher Education, a group that has participated in public protests related to a variety of issues, and other student organizations criticized elected officials and the Geogia Lottery Corp. at a rally in downtown Atlanta in response to cuts in the HOPE scholarship program. Allie McCullen, a statewide organizer with Georgia Students for Public Higher Education and a senior at the University of Georgia, said in a speech: "The Georgia Lottery Corp. has only once in the past 16 years paid out the agreed upon 35 percent of proceeds to the account which funds the HOPE scholarship." Not a single PolitiFact scribe has yet to retire on a big-ticket prize. So we decided that in the meantime we’d look into whether the odds of the Georgia Lottery Corp. paying the agreed upon percentage to the HOPE scholarship are better than the 1 in 175 million odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot. McCullen said she obtained the figure from an article published in February in the University of Georgia’s student newspaper The Red and Black, a publication she has been quoted in several times this year. The Georgia Lottery Corp.’s numbers show the lottery provided 36.1 percent of its revenue toward education in 1995, 35 percent in 1996 and 35 percent in 1997. But McCullen, who has also been quoted in The New York Times, points to the steadily declining percentage of revenue going toward education as proof that the theme of her speech still stands. Since 1997 the percentage of revenue declined from 35 percent to a low of 25.6 percent in 2009. And the lottery has not provided 30 percent of its revenue to the education fund since 2004. "I do recognize I had incorrect information, but since 1997 we have not seen a return to the 35 percent," she said. "I think the opinion I expressed remains the same." Also in dispute, however, is what percentage of revenue the lottery is required to provide the scholarship fund. The statute states that net proceeds of the lottery should be 35 percent of gross revenue "as nearly as practical." The Georgia Lottery Corp. said in a statement to PolitiFact that the phrase was added to the statute to allow the lottery to be flexible and maximize its revenue. If the organization was legally required to provide 35 percent, it could not provide large enough cash prizes to entice those looking for a lucky day, the corporation said. "In fiscal year 1997, the Georgia Lottery returned 35 percent of lottery revenues to the state for lottery-funded educational programs in the amount of $581 million," the corporation said in a written statement. "In FY10, the Georgia Lottery raised a record $883.9 million for HOPE and Pre-K, accounting for 26.1 percent of lottery revenues. Undoubtedly, more Georgia students benefited from the larger dollar amount, not the larger percentage." The dollar amount in 2010 is more, but the Georga Lottery Corp. did not make a straight comparison. In 2010 dollars the $581 million in 1997 would be the equivalent of $789 million. But some elected officials do not believe the 35 percent number included in the legislation is meaningless. Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna, said the intent of the legislation was to ensure the lottery comes close to 35 percent. She said that intent is not respected today. "I’m not sure they’re even trying anymore," she said. "We need more oversight of them and need them to come close to that 35 percent." If McCullen had said the Georgia Lottery Corp. has not hit its target of 35 percent since 1997, the accuracy of her statement would have hinged on what "as nearly as practical" means and why the legislation even included the number 35 percent. The legislators who PolitiFact spoke with agreed that the number was included for a reason and the corporation has not come close to reaching that target in recent years. But, alas, McCullen said that in the past 16 years the Georgia Lottery Corp. met the 35 percent goal only once, but it has met the target three times. So she has a better chance of winning the lottery than receiving a True on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate her statement False.	None	Allie McCullen	None	None	None	2011-04-27T06:00:00	2011-03-02	['None']
pomt-12876	North Carolina could save "literally tens of millions of dollars" if it stopped prosecuting 16-year-olds as adults.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jan/27/duane-hall/raise-age-could-juvenile-justice-reform-save-north/	At least one North Carolina legislator is saying the state could save millions of dollars if it would stop prosecuting all 16- and 17-year-olds in the adult criminal justice system. Only two states – North Carolina and New York – consider everyone as young as 16 to be adults if they commit a crime, no matter the severity or circumstances. But that might change this year. Legislators and law enforcement officers are campaigning to treat those youthful offenders as juveniles (except for serious crimes), like most of the country already does. Both the liberal N.C. Justice Center and the conservative John Locke Foundation support it. But in recent years, several similar attempts to change the law have failed. So why do supporters think things are different now? "One of the objections to the bills I had was, obviously, cost," Rep. Duane Hall, a Raleigh Democrat, told the N.C. Courts Commission in December. "But all the studies and all other states have shown that juvenile systems save states literally tens of millions of dollars." Hall has co-sponsored "Raise The Age" bills in years past and was speaking last month to drum up support for another bill he plans to file this year. Since the legislature is now back in session, we thought it was time to revisit Hall’s claim. His meaning is clear: He says "all other states" have saved millions, implying North Carolina would, too. But why has cost been a concern in the past? Expanding the juvenile-justice system isn’t free. It’s more personalized to focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment, so the costs per person can sometimes be greater than in the prison system. Yet there is a wealth of evidence that keeping teens out of adult prisons leads to lower recidivism, which is the term for when someone commits another crime after being released. That lowers the burden on courts and prisons, and society benefits, too – there are fewer crime victims, and people who would have been committing crimes are instead at school or work. But could those benefits really lead to "literally tens of millions of dollars" in savings, like Hall said? Spend money to make money William Lassiter, North Carolina’s head of juvenile justice, said that past reforms to the juvenile-justice system have led to short-term cost increases but long-term savings – to the tune of more than $40 million. Lassiter pointed to reforms for youth offenders in the late 1990s. He said they were largely responsible for decreasing juvenile infractions from 48,089 in 2006 to 29,542 in 2015 – a nearly 40 percent drop. "In 2008 our budget was $178 million," he said. "Last year it was $132 million. So already we have saved the taxpayers a significant amount of money." There’s a large body of evidence that juvenile programs lead to lower recidivism rates than adult programs. Moving teens from adult prisons and into the juvenile system, Lassiter said, would lead to future savings. "It's an evidence-based decision," Lassiter said. A study from Princeton University and the Brookings Institute backs up that line of thinking. "While it costs states billions of dollars a year to arrest, prosecute, incarcerate, and treat offenders, investing in successful delinquency-prevention programs can save taxpayers seven to 10 dollars for every dollar invested, primarily in the form of reduced spending on prisons," the study concluded. NC costs, benefits In North Carolina specifically, the most recent study on a potential "Raise The Age" law is several years old. In 2009, the N.C. General Assembly created the Youth Accountability Planning Task Force, which hired The Vera Institute of Justice to conduct a cost-benefit study. It made several key findings about treating 16- and 17-year-olds as juveniles. Some back up Hall’s claim; other’s don’t. The study found it would increase the state’s costs by $49 million per year at the start. That’s a knock against Hall’s claim. But it also found the changes would benefit the state economy (by reducing crime, hospital visits, lost days at work and more) to the tune of $102 million per year due to an expected 10 percent drop in recidivism – certainly a point in Hall’s favor. Overall, the study reached a favorable conclusion: "These results indicate that the benefits of the plan outweigh the costs and that, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the policy change merits consideration." North Carolina might receive other benefits from the law as well. A legislative report in 2013 said the change would create 450 jobs. And Lassiter said the state is currently ineligible for potentially millions in public safety grants because it’s noncompliant with federal rules for dealing with teenage offenders. And Hall said there are also intangible economic benefits to consider. "Kids in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, all around us, they could do the exact same act and not get the (criminal) record," he said. "And that’s going to make it so much easier for them to get into college or get a job than our kids." He's also right that other states have seen substantial savings. A few examples: Connecticut’s juvenile budget decreased $2 million after it passed a "Raise The Age" law. Texas was able to cut $100 million from its prisons – which researchers attributed, in part, to the substantial reduction in recidivism that new juvenile justice reforms were responsible for. University of Arizona researchers found that sending teen drug offenders through special treatment courts rather than the criminal justice system resulted in net benefits of $84,000 per teen. And in Wisconsin, a study found that "for every 1,000 youth returned to the juvenile system there will be $5.8 million in direct savings each year through reduced law enforcement costs, court costs, and losses to victims." Our ruling Rep. Duane Hall said that despite concerns over the cost of moving youthful offenders in North Carolina from the adult justice system to the juvenile justice system, the move could save the state "literally tens of millions of dollars." The state government would actually see increased costs according to one study – although the same study found the economy would reap a net benefit of tens of millions of dollars. Furthermore, the head of the state’s juvenile justice system said while previous reforms did cost millions to implement, they have since led to fewer youths in the system and corresponding savings of more than $40 million. Hall is also right that other states have found juvenile justice reforms including taking teenage offenders out of adult prisons do lead to less crime and long-term savings – possibly as much as $10 for every $1 spent on reform. Yet despite all the evidence about long-term savings, there’s also no denying there would be short-term cost increases for state government. For that reason we rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9a456e6f-a40d-4b4c-be0f-f39fc85aeab2 Share the Facts Politifact 1 6 Politifact Rating: Says North Carolina could save "literally tens of millions of dollars" if it stopped prosecuting 16-year-olds as adults.

pomt-08847	"Police officers in this state have that right," to check the immigration status of people they arrest.	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/09/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-says-florida-police-can-check-immigr/	The red-hot topic of immigration came up again in the Aug. 5, 2010, debate between Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, the Republican candidates for governor. Referencing Rick Scott's May 2010 TV ad about the need for stronger immigration laws, Bill McCollum alleged that Scott doesn't understand the state laws already on the books. "As the next governor of Florida, you're going to pass a law that allows police, when they make an arrest, to be able to find out if somebody has been here illegally. That shows an ignorance of Florida law. Currently, police officers in this state have that right already. What Arizona has is a mandate that says when you're stopped, detained, or arrested, police officers shall check to see whether you're legal or illegal. I favor that law for Florida, I favor the Arizona immigration law," McCollum said. PolitiFact Florida has already reviewed Scott's explanation of the law (Half True) and McCollum's shifting support for it (Full Flop). This time, we want to check the claim that Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of individuals who have been arrested. Turns out, McCollum is right. On June 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that law enforcement officials in all 67 Florida counties will now have access to the biometrics-based immigration records in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), a database maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Police officers will be able to run the fingerprints of individuals they arrest through the database to identify both lawful and unlawful aliens. Previously, police officers were only able to use the fingerprints to check the individuals' criminal history through a database maintained by the FBI. ICE explained the process in a press release: "If any fingerprints match those of someone in the DHS biometric system, the new automated process notifies ICE. ICE evaluates each case to determine the individual's immigration status and takes appropriate enforcement action. This includes aliens who are in lawful status and those who are present without lawful authority. Once identified through fingerprint matching, ICE will respond with a priority placed on aliens convicted of the most serious offenses first -- such as those with convictions for major drug offenses, murder, rape and kidnapping." The program is part of ICE's Secure Communities initiative, a plan that "improves public safety by implementing a comprehensive, integrated approach to identify and remove criminal aliens from the United States," according to the ICE website. As of June 2010, 23 states participated in the program, and ICE plans to make the system available nationwide by 2013. So McCollum is correct. Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. Still, after reviewing McCollum's comment and the Rick Scott ad that he referenced in more detail, we should probably provide some more clarification to our readers. First, the ad. According to the narrator, "Arizona is tackling the problem of illegal immigration, but Bill McCollum rejects the Arizona approach." The ad then goes on to say that "Rick Scott backs Arizona's law. He'll bring it to Florida, and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That's common sense." As we said above, Florida already allows its police officers to "check if the people they arrest are here legally." But the Arizona immigration law actually requires police officers to do much more than that. As we explained in the previous item, Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. In other words, Arizona police officers are required to check an individual's immigration status even if that individual is not under arrest. That is not the case in Florida. Heather Smith, a press representative from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told us in an e-mail that the agency is not aware of any court ruling or a legal opinion issued by the Florida Attorney General's office that "specifically prohibits an inquiry of an individual’s immigration status" during an investigative encounter. In other words, Florida police officers can, in theory, check the immigration status of someone pulled over for a traffic stop, but there is currently nothing in state law that would require them to do so. Implementing Arizona's law in Florida, as Scott and McCollum both favor, would change that. We also considered the counter argument that Scott's ad went up in May of this year, several weeks before the joint ICE and FDLE announcement, so McCollum's implication that Scott does not understand Florida law would not have been valid at the time. Smith told us, however, that Florida police officers have always had the ability to check an arrested individual's immigration record. Before the implementation of the Secure Communities initiative, however, they had to rely on named-based checking. The new ICE program uses "state of the art technology" and allows police officers to use digital fingerprint data for a more accurate determination. Finally, we must note that on July 28, 2010, Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction against parts of the Arizona law -- including the requirement that we discuss above. The injunction prevents certain provisions of the law from going into effect. Bolton wrote in her ruling that immigration falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government and that "there is a substantial likelihood that officers will wrongfully arrest legal resident aliens." To recap. McCollum says that Scott's ad "shows an ignorance of Florida law," because Florida police officers already have the right to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. We found that implementing an Arizona-style mandate would change existing immigration enforcement laws in the state. Currently, there is no law requiring Florida police to check the status of those who are lawfully stopped or detained, but there is nothing that would prevent them from doing so. Still, our focus in this fact-check is McCollum's claim about individuals who are already arrested, and with that, he is on solid ground. We rate this True.

pomt-12771	There were "50 percent more murders" in Orlando and Orange County, Fla., last year "than in all of Sweden."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/22/carl-bildt/former-swedish-pm-says-more-murders-florida-where-/	Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt is taking a card out of President Donald Trump’s playbook: foreign relations in 140 characters or less. At a political rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Feb. 18, Trump wrongly suggested a horrible crime had taken place in Sweden. After media reports, including PolitiFact, noted that no terrorist incident transpired in Sweden Feb. 17, Trump tried to clarify his statement multiple times. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Bildt — unsatisfied with Trump’s latest charge — struck back. "Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad," Bildt wrote in a tweet Feb. 20. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s worth noting that Trump actually spoke at the Orlando Melbourne International airport, which is approximately 65 miles southeast of Orlando and located in Brevard County, not Orange. Still, the shade being thrown was too much to resist, so PolitiFact Florida decided to take a look at Bildt’s claim for ourselves. What we found is that Bildt’s assertion relies on data that isn’t uniformly available yet, and is based on a single point of time. Not only does picking one year make it hard to make meaningful comparisons, it also includes the year with the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Crunching the numbers We never heard back from Bildt’s assistant about where he got his numbers, which made it impossible to verify the specific point he made. Bildt specifically said "last year" in his comparison, but 2016 data regarding homicides won’t be uniformly available in Sweden until March 30. Furthermore, experts said using Orlando’s 2016 murder count inflates the real murder rate because of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. "You can't make meaningful comparisons when you’re using outliers, which is why it’s better to look at long-term trends in crime," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York in Oswego. With these factors in mind, we tried to answer the overarching question Bildt’s point makes: Are there typically more murders in Orange County, which includes Orlando and has a population of about 1.2 million people, than in Sweden, population 9.8 million as of 2015? To get the most accurate picture of the situation, Schildkraut compiled 10 years worth of data (2006-15) from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI Uniform Crime Report and the The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Two important notes before we go on. First, Bildt said murders. The FBI tracks homicides. Murder falls under the larger homicide umbrella, which also includes justifiable or excusable homicides, for example. The statistics that Schildkraut provided are for murder and non-negligent manslaughter, which are still homicides, but eliminate the other justifiable or excusable cases. Second, Sweden, Orange County, Orlando and Melbourne have drastically different populations, so to get the best idea of how the Florida locations compare to Sweden it’s better to calculate the homicide rates and then compare. That rate can be calculated by dividing the number of homicides by the population and then multiplying that total by 100,000. For Orange County, Orlando and Sweden, Schildkraut found the number of homicides, the population and the homicide rate. That data shows that the homicide rate in Orange County and Orlando between 2006 to 2015 was significantly higher than Sweden’s. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com From 2006 to 2015, Sweden’s homicide rate has remained steady, hovering between 0.7 to 1.2 homicides for every 100,000 people. Orlando’s homicide rate has been significantly higher through the years. It peaked in 2006 with 22.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2006. It’s lowest rate was in 2015, when there were 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people. As for Orange County, which pulls in the Orlando suburbs, the homicide rate was still significantly higher than in Sweden. In 2015, the homicide rate in Orange County was roughly 4.3 homicides for every 100,000 people. Even if you check Melbourne, the actual location of Trump’s speech, the pattern holds. Our ruling Bildt said, "Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad." We're not sure where Bildt got his numbers from because data from 2016 is incomplete. But if history is any guide, he will actually have understated the comparison between Orlando, Orange County and Sweden. For almost a decade, homicide rates in those Florida municipalities have far exceeded that of Sweden. His argument also would have been on par for Melbourne too, had Bildt designated that as the city Trump spoke in. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79abc69a-1b6b-43da-8af5-8f86e6eb3fb7	None	Carl Bildt	None	None	None	2017-02-22T16:57:39	2017-02-20	['Sweden', 'Orange_County,_California', 'Orlando,_Florida']
pomt-05149	Says 97 cents of every dollar played "represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/20/oregon-lottery/does-97-cents-every-lottery-dollar-played-go-back-/	Every biennium, about a billion dollars flows into the state’s budget by way of the Oregon Lottery. People who play scratchers and video poker are, in a roundabout way, sending some of their cash to schools and parks and other ventures even as they hope to win the big one. But what piece of the overall Lottery revenues does that represent? Well, according to the Lottery website, billboards, TV spots and print ads, it’s about 97 cents on the dollar. Here’s what the Lottery said in a recent print ad that appeared in the June 17, 2012 Oregonian: "Every time a dollar is played on a Lottery game, think about ninety-seven cents of that dollar helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all. Ninety-seven cents represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds. Ninety-seven cents really adds up." We’d seen this same messaging several times before (some variation of the 97-cent ad has been in circulation since October 2010). And so had at least one of our readers who wrote in asking us to take a look at this claim. We called the Oregon Lottery’s spokesman, Chuck Baumann, to see where they got the figures. He pointed us to a lengthy report on the Lottery’s home page that details the operation’s finances for fiscal year 2011. The pertinent table, he said, was on Page 24 and showed that the Lottery had net sales of some $9.8 billion in 2011. Of that cash, about $300 million -- or 3 percent -- went to administrative expenses, which left 97 percent for the state. The thing is, not all of that leftover 97 percent is going to community development. The same chart shows just $523 million going to the economic development fund -- the pot of money that helps schools and parks and other areas of the state. But, as most any math student can tell you, $523 million is not 97 percent of $9.8 billion -- it’s a bit more than 5 percent. The majority of it -- more than $9 billion -- went to "prizes to the public." After looking through the report, we found another breakdown of expenses that seemed to tell a different story altogether. This one, on Page 14, showed the Lottery’s total operating revenue at just over $1 billion. Of that money, $514 million went to operating expenses -- prizes, salaries and wages, game vendor charges, market research, public information, etc. Another $550 million went to the economic development fund -- about 52 percent of the the total operating revenues. We asked Baumann what the difference was between the two tables. The one he showed us, which has nearly $10 billion in revenues, counts something called "churn," he said. See, the state’s biggest source of income (as far as gambling goes) comes in the form of video Lottery. Let’s say you sit down to play and put $20 into the machine. You play the full $20 dollars and you wind up with $10 in winning credits and you play them and lose. Well, that all gets added up in the chart as $30 of revenues -- even though that subsequent $10 never existed as real cash into the system. Conversely, the operating revenues chart that we looked at only represents the initial $20 that you played -- the actual cash into the system. In the end though, it doesn’t really matter which way you look at it, the Lottery’s ads are clearly misleading. The way the ads read, you’d think 97 cents of each dollar goes to "helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all." Now, the Lottery does note that $500 million dollars is returned "to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds." But, however you slice it, that $500 million is not 97 cents of each dollar played. If you look at the big total, which includes the churn, that $500 million is about 5 percent of the Lottery revenues. With the smaller operating revenues budget, it’s a bit over 50 percent. If the Lottery were really returning 97 percent of every dollar played to those programs, the state’s budget problems would be smaller by at least a billion dollars a biennium. The Lottery argues that the prize money going back to players ultimately benefits the state’s economy -- that’s why some earlier ads simply said "97 cents of every dollar played comes back to Oregon." But even those ads mislead by highlighting state services. And what’s more, winnings don’t necessarily stay here. If you win $1 million in the Oregon Lottery, would you spend it all in Oregon? Baumann defended the earlier version but acknowledged that you could "certainly misconstrue" the meaning of the ad we’re ruling on. We think it’s more than a matter of misconstruing meaning. For nearly two years, the Oregon Lottery has been running a disingenuous ad campaign that tries to paint playing the Lottery as giving back to schools, parks and other economic development projects. Yes, a piece of the revenue goes there -- but not 97 cents of every dollar played. We think a state agency that deals with money in billions -- and spends nearly $13 million a year on advertising, market research and public information -- should know better.

pomt-07577	As a prosecutor, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser did not investigate or file charges in a case involving 30-year pedophile priest, then participated in cover-up.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-supreme-court-jus/	A new TV ad claims that in 1978, when Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser was a district attorney, he didn’t ask police to investigate an abuse case involving a longtime pedophile priest, then refused to file charges and participated in a cover-up. The claims are made by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which frequently runs TV ads critical of Republicans. The group is also running an anti-Prosser ad linking the 13-year justice to Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Both ads were released less than two weeks before Prosser faces challenger assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2011, election. The priest ad quickly sparked controversy partly because two brothers who were the victims in 1978 case repudiated it. Here’s what the narrator says in the ad, which began airing March 24, 2011: "A priest sexually abuses children for 30 years across Wisconsin. A mother tells DA David Prosser her two young sons were sexually assaulted. What does Prosser do? Prosser refuses to prosecute; doesn’t even ask the police to investigate. Instead, Prosser meets with the bishop. To avoid scandal, they send the priest to another community and the assaults continue. Tell David Prosser: Judges should protect our children, not sex offenders." A picture of Prosser is shown throughout the ad. A picture of the priest is shown briefly, along with two newspaper headlines revealing that Prosser had declined to file charges and was questioned about the decision. The priest, the mother and her two sons are not identified by name. But there is no dispute that the ad refers to a May 1978 incident that Sharon Merryfield reported to Prosser, who was the Outagamie County district attorney at the time. Merryfield told Prosser -- who said he attended middle and high school with her -- that Catholic priest John Patrick Feeney improperly touched her sons Todd, then 14, and Troy, then 12, at the family’s home. A court summary in a later matter says Feeney, who worked at a church in Freedom, touched the boys in the chest area and moved his hand downward toward their penises but did not touch them there. Feeney also pinched one of the boys on the buttocks. The incident -- as a result of a later investigation, in 2002 -- helped put Feeney behind bars. Let’s see whether information in the ad backs up the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s central claims -- that Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate the two boys’ accusations against a longtime pedophile priest; that Prosser didn’t file criminal charges; and that he participated in a cover-up of the priest’s actions. We’ll draw from evidence cited by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, news reports, court records and comments Prosser made during a 20-minute discussion of the case with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board on March 24, 2011. The ad essentially makes three sets of claims. We’ll address them one at a time. The incident involved a priest who had abused children for 30 years The ad suggests that when the matter came to Prosser, he was aware Feeney had a long history of molesting boys. But evidence that Feeney molested boys over some 30 years emerged 24 years later, in the 2002 investigation, which was conducted by the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Department. That investigation found Feeney had molested boys dating back to 1969, although no charges were filed in the older incidents because the statute of limitations had expired. So, while the priest may have had an extensive history of sexual abuse, the ad takes it out of context to suggest this was known by Prosser in 1978. Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate and refused to prosecute. Prosser said in the editorial board interview that he interviewed both boys and found another Feeney victim, but that victim refused to testify. He did not ask a police agency -- in this case, the Sheriff’s Department -- to investigate, so the ad is correct on that claim. It is an open question whether the Sheriff’s Department would have investigated the Merryfield boys incident and related cases more vigorously than Prosser did. The ad is also correct that Prosser decided not to file charges against Feeney. But it provides no context as to why they were not pursued. In his comments to the Journal Sentinel, Prosser cited several reasons. Prosser said the case would have been difficult to prove at the time because Feeney had not indecently touched the boys, and because it would pit the credibility of two boys against the credibility of a priest. He also said the case would be hard on the family because it would become sensationalized, given that Feeney’s brother, Joe Feeney, was a regular performer on the Lawrence Welk network television show. And he said his office lacked experienced prosecutors. So, this statement also leaves out key information. Indeed, records show more details came out during the future investigations, which made the case against Feeney stronger. By that point, other victims had emerged. Prosser and a bishop, "to avoid scandal," sent the priest to another community and the assaults continued. Prosser said that as part of his investigation, he told Green Bay Bishop Aloysius Wycislo that Feeney needed to be removed from the Freedom parish and that the bishop replied by saying, "I will take care of it." Prosser said he related that information to the Merryfield family when he told them he had decided not to file charges. "The family didn’t seem to be that upset at the time," told the editorial board. Wycislo wrote a letter in 1978 saying Prosser had come to him "to prevent unnecessary scandal." He also wrote: "I had to agree with the district attorney that the church would prefer to keep this out of court and out of the public eye and I was able to tell (Feeney) of our decision last week, with which he agreed." So, the "avoiding scandal" characterization is attributable to the bishop. Prosser says choosing not to prosecute had nothing to do with avoiding scandal. What’s more, Prosser would not have had any official role in moving Feeney, although it appears he and the bishop agreed that should be done. Prosser said that, to his surprise, Feeney was not moved until more than six months later. By that time, Prosser had won election to the state Assembly and left his district attorney post. He had been campaigning for the job when Sharon Merryfield first came to him. Prosser also noted that in January 1979, Sharon Merryfield filed a report with the Sheriff’s Department about the incident in her home, and that that report also did not result in criminal charges. In 2002, the Sheriff’s Department opened another investigation after another Feeney victim was discovered. News reports said Feeney worked in 18 parishes over 30 years in the Green Bay diocese before he left Wisconsin in 1983. The reports cited church documents in saying that Feeney left amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct with altar boys. Authorities were able to charge Feeney in the 2002 investigation because he had left Wisconsin, which meant the statute of limitations had not expired. That supports the point in the ad that says abuse continued. That’s where the ad ends. But let’s finish the story about how Feeney ended up behind bars. As the case summary shows, Troy Merryfield stated in the 2002 sheriff’s investigation that Feeney had grabbed his penis during a face-to-face confession one or two months before the May 1978 incident in the Merryfield home. Prosser said Troy Merryfield never told him about the earlier incident; and the appeals court noted that the earlier incident was not mentioned in the January 1979 sheriff’s report that had been filed by Sharon Merryfield. So, Prosser did not have that allegation to consider when he decided not to file charges against Feeney. The 2002 sheriff’s investigation produced five felony charges against Feeney for the two incidents involving the Merryfield brothers. The charges included attempting to touch the boy’s penises during the incident in their home. Feeney was convicted of four of the charges and was sentenced in 2004 to 15 years in prison. Now 84, he could be released from prison in November 2011 on extended supervision, according to the state Department of Corrections. Troy Merryfield issued a statement the day after the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s ad was released, calling the ad "offensive, inaccurate and out of context." The statement said the sheriff’s 2002 investigation resulted in charges because he and his brother were able to provide more detailed information about Feeney’s actions than they did when Prosser handled the case in 1978, and that, as adults, they were more comfortable about testifying. In 2008, Troy Merryfield had been critical of Prosser, saying he should step aside when cases involving priest sexual misconduct come before the Supreme Court. "He knows damn well what happened and what was said," Merryfield said about his own case in 2008. "He dropped the ball, and he should recuse himself." Todd Merryfield told PolitiFact Wisconsin he stands by his brother’s statement condemning the ad and agreed it should no longer be aired. So, where does all of this leave us? The Greater Wisconsin Committee claims David Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate a mother’s report that a 30-year pedophile priest had indecently touched her two sons, then refused to file charges him and participated in a cover-up of the priest’s acts. The committee’s TV ad uses generally factual statements to make its case, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. By using information that only became known later, it suggests more information was available to Prosser at the time than really was. For instance, Prosser didn’t know that the priest had a long history of molestation -- that came out 24 years later. And it wasn’t until 24 years later that one of the brothers made the most serious allegation against the priest. Finally, the two brothers have condemned the ad as "offensive, inaccurate and out of context." We rate the committee’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14911	"No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/nov/03/kevin-de-leon/does-california-have-most-ambitious-clean-energy-g/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: California is known for setting lofty clean energy goals. But are its targets the most ambitious on the planet? That’s what state Senate leader Kevin de León claimed in a speech in October after Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 350, a landmark climate change package authored by the senator. The current legislation requires 50 percent of California’s electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030. That’s up from an earlier mandate calling for 33 percent of the state’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Currently, California gets about a quarter of its energy from renewables, thanks to the huge solar and wind farms that have popped up in places like the Mojave Desert in recent years. The bill by the Los Angeles Democrat also calls on the state to double the energy efficiency of its buildings by 2030. "Senate Bill 350 puts us on track to generate half, half of our electricity from renewable sources. And double the energy efficiency of all of our buildings by 2030. No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted targets more ambitious in scale," De León said in a speech at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. We decided to fact-check De León’s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than California, with a focus on renewable energy. Our research At first glance, the senator’s statement seemed headed for a "False" rating or even "Pants on Fire!" That’s because some countries, as well as other U.S. states, and even some cities in California have more aggressive renewable energy goals, at least on a percentage basis. San Francisco’s goal, for example, is to meet 100 percent of its electricity demand with renewable power by 2020 — a decade before California wants to get half of its electricity from renewables. Hawaii’s target is 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045. Vermont’s is 75 percent renewable use by 2032. The percentage threshold is higher for both states but further out than California’s. Internationally, Norway has a goal to produce 67.5 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, which would be a higher rate and earlier timeframe than California’s goal. But looking at De León’s statement closely, he qualifies it by saying California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious "in scale." His office clarified that the senator was referencing California’s large population size, and its potential to consume and produce more clean energy compared with other states and even some countries. California used 261.5 million megawatt hours of electricity two years ago. That was 27 times the amount used in Hawaii that year, and also far more than Vermont or even Norway. Considering that disparity, some clean energy experts said California does have the most ambitious goals, at least nationally. "There are many different ways you can try to quantify this, and ways that you can judge how ambitious something is," said Brian Lips, who manages a national database on renewable energy for the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. "But, I think, in general, this claim was mostly true." More difficult to answer is the question about whether California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious globally. Various rankings place China at or near the top for global production of renewable energy, far beyond what California can produce. But that country’s goal of deriving 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020 lags behind the Golden State’s target of 33 percent by that year. Comparing California’s clean energy targets and with those of countries is difficult because not all goals are measured the same way, said Laura Wisland, a senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists and an expert on California renewable energy. Some countries list goals for future clean energy capacity, or the amount of energy they hope to generate after building wind, solar or other renewable energy projects, Wisland said. California’s goal, on the other hand, is tied to the amount of energy it actually uses each year. The enforcement of clean energy standards is a key factor in judging how aggressive they are. Goals set by about a quarter of the states in the U.S. that have renewable energy goals are non-binding recommendations, Wisland added. That’s not the case in California, said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s California Climate Project. NRDC is an environmental advocacy group. "I think what differentiates California is the degree of specificity and accountability on the main strategies that we are going to be deploying to achieve that target," said Jackson, referring to the goals in SB 350. "We have the goals in place. We also have the roadmap to get there, with the appropriate oversight and enforcement to hold emitters accountable." In 2012, California became the first state to create a comprehensive cap-and-trade program. It effectively puts a price on carbon emissions by imposing a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide industry can release. The state raises money for clean energy projects each year by auctioning emissions permits. Jackson said that model plus the new goals in SB 350 set California apart. "If you add up the combined effect of the targets that are in the bill, they easily represent the most ambitious clean energy roadmap anywhere in the world," he said. Our ruling Senate leader Kevin de León says "no city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale." If we define "ambitious" as setting high goals and being able to follow through on them, then California clearly has some of the strongest clean energy initiatives in the country and on the planet. That doesn’t mean, however, that it has established the only aggressive targets. Prominent examples include Norway, Hawaii and even San Francisco. In terms of producing clean energy, California won’t be able to compete with global leaders such as China or the United States even if those countries have less aggressive renewable energy targets. Their size makes that impossible. But working in California’s favor, it has an enforcement framework in place. Notably, its cap-and-trade system provides an incentive for industry to invest in renewable energy. We rate the claim Mostly True, which we define as "accurate but needs clarification or additional information."	None	Kevin de León	None	None	None	2015-11-03T00:00:00	2015-10-07	['None']
pomt-03751	"Expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-expanding-medicaid-will-worsen-healt/	Editor's note: After we published this report, the staff at Cruz's office gave us more information to consider. We considered that evidence in a separate report, but it did not change our initial findings or our ruling. Our original report remains below. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who is gaining a reputation for bold statements, is backing Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to reject a major expansion of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. Under the new health care law, states can get federal dollars to enroll their uninsured residents in Medicaid. Some politicians, including Cruz and Perry, argue that taking the federal money now leaves the state on the hook for long-term fiscal commitments it can’t afford. Cruz, though, has gone beyond arguing that the expansion is too expensive. He recently said it would also leave the uninsured worse off. "Our friends who are saying they want health care do not realize that expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas," Cruz said at an event with Perry and others in the state capitol in Austin. This struck some observers as illogical: How could moving someone who’s uninsured onto the Medicaid rolls actually worsen someone’s health care options? When we checked with Cruz’s office, they referred us to a floor speech he gave on March 13, 2013. Here’s the relevant portion of that speech: "The data demonstrates Medicaid beneficiaries face worse health outcomes than just about anybody else in the marketplace. In 2010, the Annals of Surgery issued a landmark study which examined the outcomes from nearly 900,000 individuals undergoing surgery from 2003 to 2007. ... Medicaid patients, when compared to people without health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients were 13 percent more likely to die. They stayed in the hospital for 50 percent longer and cost 20 percent more. "In 2011, Johns Hopkins did a study of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Their conclusions were very much the same. They found that Medicaid patients were 8.1 percent less likely to be alive 10 years after the transplant compared with those with private insurance and also compared to those without any insurance at all. Overall, the Johns Hopkins study found that Medicaid patients faced a 29-percent greater risk of death, and yet Obamacare is moving more and more of the economically disadvantaged onto Medicaid, which subjects them to those worse health care outcomes." This is a line of argument that had appeared earlier in a number of conservative outlets, including a Wall Street Journal op-ed and a Manhattan Institute briefing paper. These analyses offered some additional studies with similar findings. Even though Cruz did not specifically mention these other studies, they have been cited so frequently in the debate that we will include them in our analysis. To start, we should note that even many critics of Cruz’s perspective acknowledge some concerns about the Medicaid expansion under the new health care law. First, most experts we contacted agreed that studies, including the two Cruz specifically cited, show that patients on Medicaid tend not to have health outcomes as positive as patients on private insurance (though they add that Medicaid is not necessarily the cause, since it’s hard to disentangle insurance status from socioeconomic and lifestyle factors). Second, experts acknowledge that Medicaid is not a perfect program and that various policy changes could make it more effective. And third, they say that adding millions of additional beneficiaries under the new health care law will impose additional strains on the program. That said, our examination of the medical papers, including interviews with some authors of the studies in question, suggests that Cruz has made too big a leap by arguing that an uninsured patient actually becomes worse off when they sign up for Medicaid. Here are a few of the reasons for caution: • The trends are more mixed than Cruz’s claim suggests. In many of the studies, uninsured patients did end up having better outcomes than Medicaid patients did, such as fewer complications and longer survival. But this trend isn’t universal. For instance, in one study, Medicaid patients had worse outcomes for clogged arteries but better outcomes for abdominal aortic aneurysms. • The authors of the studies do not make the argument Cruz does. Not one of the half-dozen studies we looked at articulated Cruz’s argument that someone will have a worse health outcome if they move from no insurance to Medicaid. The studies generally did not focus on comparing Medicaid patients to uninsured patients. Rather, they focused on the performance of Medicaid and uninsured patients collectively, compared to Medicare and private insurance on the other hand. In addition, most papers inserted extensive language urging caution about the limitations of their research. What Cruz and others have done is "the worst kind of selective reading of the studies," said Michael A. Gaglia Jr., a professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine and the co-author of one of the papers. • The definition of "uninsured" in these studies is too fuzzy to be reliable. In these studies, the term "uninsured" doesn’t just refer to the popular image of someone who’s too economically strapped to afford health insurance. It can also include poor people getting free charity care from world-class hospitals, very wealthy patients who pay their own bills rather than carrying health insurance, and healthy young adults who gambled by not obtaining insurance but got sick anyway. Each of these patient groupings may have advantages in recovering more quickly, which could explain some of the the better outcomes among the uninsured. Meanwhile, the definition of Medicaid is also fuzzy because people can sign up for Medicaid after being diagnosed with a serious ailment at a hospital. The studies didn’t distinguish between patients who have been on Medicaid for years, people who were uninsured for years but suddenly signed up for Medicaid before receiving treatment, and those who remained uninsured all the way through treatment. • The number of both Medicaid patients and the uninsured who were studied was quite small. In many of the studies, private insurance and Medicare patients dominated the pool of those studied. (Medicare is the federal health insurance program for Americans over age 65; because it’s mandatory for seniors, it includes people of all income levels.) Typically, uninsured patients and those on Medicaid represented 3 percent to 5 percent of the individuals studied. Experts say it’s unwise to draw sweeping conclusions from small sample sizes. • The Annals of Surgery study Cruz cited has an important quirk in the results. The study looked at 11 types of surgery and found that in all 11, the outcomes were worse for Medicaid patients than for the uninsured. However, in 10 of those cases, patients on Medicare also had worse outcomes than the uninsured did. As Boston University health economist Austin Frakt has put it, "Any theory to explain what’s going on in Medicaid had better explain Medicare, too." • Other studies have shown a positive health benefit from joining Medicaid. A recent study in Oregon compares Medicaid enrollees who had been chosen by a lottery to uninsured residents who were not enrolled. The study indicated that the new Medicaid enrollees reported better health than those who remained uninsured, though the findings are preliminary. Our ruling Cruz said that "expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas." Not only does this assertion make no logical sense -- some health coverage should always be an improvement over none -- but the evidence Cruz and others have pointed to also doesn’t back up his point. None of the studies make the argument Cruz does, and the small sample sizes of uninsured patients, combined with the challenge of defining the terms "Medicaid" and "uninsured," pose serious questions about whether Cruz’s conclusion is valid. In fact, several authors of the papers we contacted disagreed with Cruz’s interpretation of their research. This sweeping generalization does not hold up. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10031	The omnibus bill has only $3.8 billion in earmarks.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/02/democratic-congressional-leadership/democrats-claim-omnibus-spending-bill-has-only-38-/	Stung by charges that the economic stimulus bill that passed last month was packed with pork, Democrats are claiming the big 2009 spending bill they're now considering has a relatively small number of earmarks. Many news outlets have cited Democratic estimates that there are only $3.8 billion in earmarks in the $410 billion bill, which is known as the Omnibus because it is the product of nine bills that failed to pass last fall. But Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that tracks federal spending, says the number is $7.7 billion. Why the big difference? The Democrats count the number differently. Before we explain, here's a little context. These numbers aren't just a matter of arcane bookkeeping. They are significant because earmarks have become a key political issue. As a candidate, President Obama promised to reduce earmarks to the levels from 1994, the year that Republicans took control of Congress. So it's important to measure them accurately. The Democrats' $3.8 billion figure has been widely reported. We found it in Congressional Quarterly , the New York Times , the Associated Press and USA Today , among others. Most stories attribute the number to the Democratic leadership in Congress, while USA Today specifically cited Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic staff of the House Appropriations Committee. Brost told us that she specified to reporters that the number was for "non-project-based" federal programs, such as water projects for dams, navigational improvements and beach renourishment. These programs have such a high percentage of earmarks that Democrats exclude them from their totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut. But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said they should be included in the definition of earmarks because the projects being excluded meet Congress' own definitition — the funding is requested by lawmakers for specific projects that in most cases are in their districts or home states. (For more on the definition, see this earlier PolitiFact item on White House claims that there were no earmarks in the stimulus bill.) "According to Congress, these are earmarks. So to say there are $3.8 billion in earmarks (in the Omnibus) is misleading at best," Ellis said. Ellis invoked a weight-loss analogy to explain what the Democrats are doing. "It’s easier to make your weight loss goals if you don’t count your rear end," he said. Brost says she has been precise with reporters that she was referring to the "non-project-based" numbers. But judging from the number of times we found the number cited as the Democratic estimate for earmarks, her nuance was not caught by reporters or by Democrats who have cited the figure. Either way, the number is not a fair account of the total earmarks. We find the Taxpayers for Common Sense estimate to be right and we find the statement False.

pomt-10851	"When NAFTA was passed, there was an acceleration of immigration from Mexico because people were in search of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/07/dennis-kucinich/nafta-not-a-big-factor-in-increase/	At the Univision debate in Miami on Sept. 9, 2007, Kucinich said the North American Free Trade Agreement had led to a surge in immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico. He said, "When NAFTA was passed, there was an acceleration of immigration from Mexico because people were in search of jobs." He is correct that migration from Mexico has accelerated since NAFTA took effect in 1994, but it's a stretch to attribute that to the trade agreement. Independent analysis suggests there are several other factors involved besides NAFTA. Experts point out that migration from Mexico in the 1990s was encouraged by the booming economy in the United States. Migration peaked in 2000 and since then has fallen off by more than a quarter following the slowdown in the economy after 2001. Emigration was already high before 1994, especially due to people fleeing the wars in Central America in the 1980s. Poverty, coupled with natural disasters (Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and an earthquake in El Salvador in 2001) continues to draw large numbers of migrants from Central America. In fact, immigration patterns were not substantially affected by NAFTA, according to a February 2004 report by the Congressional Research Service. The report found that while legal and unauthorized worker migration from Mexico to the United States did accelerate after NAFTA was implemented in 1994, the trade agreement was "largely irrelevant." It found that workers were drawn to the United States by Mexico's inability to provide jobs for a burgeoning work force, as well as periodic financial crises that caused huge job losses and undermined confidence in the Mexican economy.

pomt-04454	"Newgard owed more than $13,000 for unpaid taxes on his $1 million Milwaukie apartment complex."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/11/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/did-steve-newgard-owe-13000-back-taxes-1-million-p/	House Democrats have been slamming Republican candidate Steve Newgard pretty hard on his failure to pay property and income taxes over the years. Newgard faces Democrat Brent Barton, a former representative and lawyer, in the race to replace outgoing Rep. Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, for House District 40 in Clackamas County. Democrats have set up a website devoted to Newgard’s tax delinquency. There’s also a TV ad paid for by Friends of Brent Barton, which has been on air for about three weeks. Newgard doesn’t contest that he has failed on multiple occasions to pay his taxes on time -- although he resents the implication that what he’s done is illegal. He did pay up, along with late penalties. But one statement made by Democrats has puzzled him and his children. "Newgard owed more than $13,000 for unpaid taxes on his $1 million Milwaukie apartment complex," says the gloomy voice-over in the bleak ad targeting Newgard. The ad later states that he "won’t pay his taxes." One million dollars? If only he owned the multi-story, Craftsman-style units featured so briefly in the campaign attack ad. Alas, Newgard says, his five-unit complex in Milwaukie is decidedly more modest, "little ramblers built in the 1960s." The single-story units are numbered 9 through 14. (There is no No. 13.) The Clackamas County tax assessor’s office says the property has a real market value of $302,000 for 2012. So how do Democrats go from $300,000 to $1 million? We did some sleuthing with our Scooby nose. Apparently there are four complexes at this address, with three separate owners. Newgard owns one. Another person owns two, with a combined market value of $480,000. The third person owns the most expensive portion, valued at $1.2 million. Newgard doesn’t own the $1.2 million property. And it would seem that House Democrats who set up www.stevenewgardfacts.comunderstand this. Because the only property tax statement they post is the one that shows his property valued last year at $280,000. So what gives? We sent an email to Jared Mason-Gere, spokesman for House Democrats’ political action committee. "We screwed up," he wrote back late Tuesday. "The assessment of the apartment complex is a mistake, plain and simple." "It was never our intent to mislead anyone on this, since the point was never about the building, it's always been about the unpaid taxes. The ad will be down tomorrow, if it's not already down, and it will be corrected with the right figure." We also checked with the Newgards to verify the accuracy of the amount owed on the apartment complex. Linda, Steve Newgard’s wife, said they fell behind on payments but paid the amount due with interest in July. The amount paid was about $13,200, she said. She said they have paid taxes faithfully but fell behind when the economy soured. Her husband runs a masonry business. The commercial, she said, "villainized him, like he had done a crime. Being on top of our taxes is important to us. These are not easy times." Obviously, it’s up to Clackamas County voters to decide whether this is an issue for them. What we can confirm is that Newgard owed more than $13,000 on his apartment complex. And if the Democrats want to make the point that Newgard paid his taxes late, that’s fine. But the complex he owns is nothing like the fat cat pad pictured and claimed as valued at $1 million. "The core argument remains," Mason-Gere said. "Steve Newgard thinks he plays by a different set of rules; voters should not trust Steve Newgard with their taxes when he can't even be trusted to pay his own." We’re not so sure. It’s not cool to get behind on your payments to government, but it’s an option open to others, not just to Newgard. And he did pay, despite the assertion in the ad that he "won’t pay his taxes." The ad, in our view, gives the image of a wealthy candidate wiggling out of rules that apply to the humble rank-and-file. And that’s what turns this into a statement that contains an element of truth -- property taxes were owed -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. A $300,000 rental property doesn’t have the same ring as a $1 million one. Late Wednesday House Democrats shared a new version of the ad. There is no mention of the value of the property and no image of one either. We like how quickly Democrats work. We still rate the statement Mostly False.

That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents. (Where were those headlines?) Perry's backup We decided to put Perry's number to the Texas Truth-O-Meter, starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3, 2014, testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. After saying the "consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico" undermine public safety, McCraw said: "Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non-immigration crimes throughout Texas." He then mentioned "over 3,000 homicides" since 2008. Asked for elaboration, a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, pointed to an agency web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," stating that since January 2012, a monthly average of 5,899 "foreign nationals" -- individuals legally authorized to live in the U.S. or not -- have been arrested in Texas, with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge. Also on the page: "From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults," the agency says. The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants: Source: Web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014) The last line on the page says "these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison." We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges. We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011. Vinger replied by email, "We don’t have any additional information." Outside criminologists Next, we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information. To rehash, the governor told Beck more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by "illegal aliens" since 2008. However, the DPS web page doesn’t say that; it doesn’t even specify when (or where) the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the "alien" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated. Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation. Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said the DPS information doesn’t demonstrate the 3,000-plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008. Rather, Walker said by phone, the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. "Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?" Walker said, his point being such information isn’t on the web page. Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry. Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS. Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said Perry’s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3,070, or 46 percent, of the estimated homicides were committed by "illegal aliens." But, he said, "that makes no sense." He said in a follow-up email: "It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed." The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions. Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande. Neither the DPS or Perry’s office offered more information. Our ruling Perry told Beck over 3,000 homicides were committed "by illegal aliens over the" last six years. This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on, which indicates that since 2008 in Texas, more than 200,000 arrested immigrants -- foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission -- had among them accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. Put another way, for this declaration to hold water, one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state’s homicides since 2008; we found no such data.

pomt-13685	On whether he’s had a relationship with Vladimir Putin.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-gets-full-flop-whether-hes-had-relati/	The intrusion into the Democratic National Committee’s computers, allegedly by Russian hackers, has put a renewed spotlight on Donald Trump’s connections to Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. When Trump sat for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos shortly after the Democratic National Convention, Stephanopoulos brought up the topic. Trump told Stephanopoulos that he didn’t have a relationship with Putin. Stephanopoulos challenged him on this -- and the host was on solid ground. Trump’s denial of a relationship with Putin contradicted what he had said on multiple previous occasions. Prior to early 2016, Trump seemed to tout his ties to the Russian leader. Trump, a lifelong businessman, boasted of foreign policy experience based on his experience hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. For instance, during an interview with Fox News on May 6, 2016, Trump told host Bret Baier, "I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success." But the closeness Trump claims to Putin-era Russia has prompted questions from critics, including foreign policy professionals in both parties. The U.S. government sees Russia as a geopolitical rival and Putin in particular as a sometimes problematic force in international relations. Trump’s seeming fondness for Putin has worried critics in both parties. For instance, Trump took flak a few days before the Stephanopoulos interview after he seemed to encourage Russia to spy on the United States in order to find thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," he said. "I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press," Trump said during a news conference in Florida." So, facing growing questions about the wisdom of attaching his star to Putin’s, has Trump changed his position on whether the two have had a relationship? Here’s a closer look. Trump’s earlier comments suggesting a relationship with Putin Here are four occasions between 2013 and 2015 when Trump touted his ties to Putin. • When Thomas Roberts of MSNBC asked Trump, "Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?" Trump responded, "I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today. He's probably very interested in what you and I am saying today, and I'm sure he's going to be seeing it in some form." -- interview, November, 2013 • "You know, I was in Moscow a couple of months ago. I own the Miss Universe Pageant and they treated me so great. Putin even sent me a present, a beautiful present." -- address at the CPAC conference, March 2014 • "Russia does not respect our country any longer. They see we've been greatly weakened, both militarily and otherwise, and he certainly does not respect President Obama. So what I would do—as an example, I own Miss Universe, I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success. The show was live from Moscow, and we had tremendous success there and it was amazing, but to do well, you have to get the other side to respect you, and he does not respect our president, which is very sad." -- address at the National Press Club, May 2014 • "As far as the Ukraine is concerned … if Putin wants to go in -- and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes. We were stablemates, and we did very well that night." -- portion of an answer at the Fox Business News debate, Nov. 2015. (The notion that the two men appeared together on 60 Minutes has been debunked. As Time magazine put it succinctly, "In fact, they weren’t even on the same continent.") The Stephanopoulos interview Recently, though, Trump has changed his tune. Here are excerpts from the Trump-Stephanopoulos interview, which aired on ABC’s This Week on July 31. Stephanopoulos: "Let's talk about Russia. You made a lot of headlines with Russia this week. What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin?" Trump: "I have no relationship to -- with him. I have no relationship with him." Stephanopoulos: "But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke…" Trump: "Because he has said nice things about me over the years. I remember years ago, he said something -- many years ago, he said something very nice about me. I said something good about him when Larry King was on. This was a long time ago. And I said he is a tough cookie or something to that effect. He said something nice about me. This has been going on. We did 60 Minutes together. By the way, not together-together, meaning he was probably shot in Moscow…." Stephanopoulos: "Well, he was in Moscow…." Trump: "And I was shot in New York." Stephanopoulos: "You were in New York. But that's the thing." Trump: "No, just so you understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have no relationship with him. I don't -- I've never met him. … I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. … I mean if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so. ..." Stephanopoulos: "You've never spoken to him on the phone?" Trump: "I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. … Well, I don't know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don't have a relationship with him. I didn't meet him. I haven't spent time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go hiking with him. I don't know -- and I wouldn't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I would know what he looks like." Also, on July 27, Trump said at a press conference in Florida, "I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin." For the record: Media outlets have said the more accurate translation for what Putin said was "flamboyant," rather than "genius," and Putin subsequently confirmed that he was trying to indicate "flamboyant" when he made his his remark. Our ruling Trump has changed what he’s said about whether he’s had a relationship with Putin. In 2013, he said, "I do have a relationship." In 2014 he said, "I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin" and said the Russian leader had sent him a present. In 2015, he said, "I got to know him very well" due to their joint appearance on 60 Minutes. More recently, though, Trump has said, "I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is" and "I have no relationship with him."

pomt-01817	Says former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that "if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society" because "they'll serve the masters gladly and passively."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/21/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-alan-greenspan-said-insecur/	Amid a stubbornly slow economic recovery, a reader recently forwarded us a social media post taking aim at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for using callous language about worker insecurity. The post features images of Greenspan and says: I am Alan And, I used to run the Federal Reserve. And, I actually said this: If the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society, because if workers are insecure they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations. The reader wondered if the five-time chairman of the United States’ central bank actually said something so dismissive about America’s economically left-behind. So did we. As it turns out, Greenspan didn’t say it. Instead, it's academic Noam Chomsky's take on something Greenspan said. And Greenspan and Chomsky couldn’t be more different ideologically. As a young man, Greenspan was a member of the inner circle of Ayn Rand, the libertarian thinker and novelist. (Rand would eventually stand with Greenspan when he was sworn in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974.) Greenspan was nominated for the Fed chairmanship by three Republican presidents (Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) as well as by Democrat Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, Chomsky is an influential academic linguist who’s at least as well known for his political views. They veer sharply left and are sometimes referred to as "anarcho-syndicalist," a philosophy he’s described as promoting "a very organized society, but organized from below by direct participation at every level, with as little control and domination as is feasible, maybe none." So how did this misattribution happen? It emerged from remarks Chomsky made to the Adjunct Faculty Association of the United Steelworkers on Feb. 4, 2014, reprinted in transcript form in the February-March issue of CounterPunch. Here are excerpts from a section of the transcript where Chomsky discusses the issue of universities hiring non-tenure-track faculty: "That’s part of the business model. It’s the same as hiring temps in industry or what they call ‘associates’ at Walmart -- employees that aren’t owed benefits. It’s a part of a corporate business model designed to reduce labor costs and to increase labor servility. When universities become corporatized ... they want to keep costs down and make sure that labor is docile and obedient. The way to do that is, essentially, temps. … "This idea is sometimes made quite overt. So when Alan Greenspan was testifying before Congress in 1997 on the marvels of the economy he was running, he said straight out that one of the bases for its economic success was imposing what he called ‘greater worker insecurity.’ If workers are more insecure, that’s very ‘healthy’ for the society, because if workers are insecure they won’t ask for wages, they won’t go on strike, they won’t call for benefits; they’ll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that’s optimal for corporations’ economic health. At the time, everyone regarded Greenspan’s comment as very reasonable, judging by the lack of reaction and the great acclaim he enjoyed." We looked at Greenspan’s Feb. 26, 1997, testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Here’s a portion: "The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. … Continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. … Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now, and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably." Greenspan, in his testimony, then suggests technological change and international competition as possible reasons for worker insecurity, before noting that "suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards." Chomsky’s take on the substance of what Greenspan said seems reasonably on target. However, Greenspan’s tone is far different than Chomsky’s. Greenspan’s words are explanatory and analytical, displaying none of the sarcasm that Chomsky, or the creator of the Facebook post, ascribes to them -- especially the part about workers serving their masters "gladly and passively." Reached by email, Chomsky confirmed that he and other economists have periodically pointed to Greenspan’s 1997 testimony, including a reference in his book, Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy. Chomsky added, "Don’t know anything about Facebook. I don’t use it." Our ruling The meme says Greenspan said that "if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society" because "they'll serve the masters gladly and passively." Those words actually come from a sarcastic critique of Greenspan’s words by Noam Chomsky, not from Greenspan himself. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02783	"For the cost of $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/06/cover-oregon/can-health-insurance-plans-be-purchased-cost-5-van/	The success of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act relies heavily on persuading younger people to sign up. While it’s not guaranteed that those in their early 20s are healthier than their older, graying counterparts, they tend to be. Without them, health insurance exchanges are likely to fill with people who need more care, increasing overall risks and sending insurance premiums higher. Still, it may not be an easy sell to get the 75 percent of younger people who lack health care insurance according to a recent Gallup poll, to sign up for coverage. Some may bet they simply don’t need health care coverage. Others may do the math and figure they’d spend less on the federally mandated penalty for not having coverage. So state and federal insurance officials are coming up with novel ways to get the message to their target audience. A group in Colorado, for instance, crafted an Internet-only ad campaign showing a college student doing a handstand on a keg of beer. "Keg stands are crazy," the ad said. "Not having health insurance is crazier." Cover Oregon is now running ads with the same goal of attracting young people. In trying to show that health insurance is more affordable than many think, the tag line is, "For the cost of [a] $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match." That figure caught our eye. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check whether Cover Oregon has the grounds to say coverage can be obtained for the cost of a daily coffee drink. We called Michael Cox, a Cover Oregon media contact. He passed along charts showing the cost for monthly insurance premiums in the seven coverage areas around the state: Portland, Bend, Eugene, Salem, Medford, Pendleton-Hermiston and the coast. Each chart contains rates of the 14 companies expected to offer plans through Cover Oregon for people ages 21, 40 and 60. The rates assume that those applying for insurance are single, non-tobacco users. The chart includes prices for three levels of coverage: Bronze (pays an estimated 60 percent of medical costs), Silver (70 percent), and Gold (80 percent). As noted later, catastrophic-only plans will also be available. All amounts represent costs before financial help in the form of tax credits. When asked about the $5-a-day claim, Cox directed us to a plan offered by Moda Health. It charges a 21-year-old unmarried non-tobacco-user $130 a month for bronze-level coverage. That comes out to $1,560 annually. Divide that by 365 days, and you get just over $4.27 per day. "So really," Cox said, "you’d get a little change back for that $5 bill." (And, yes, the costs are roughly in line with a vanilla soy latte. At Portland-area Starbucks, the drink runs $3.85 to $4.85, depending on size.) A 40-year-old, by comparison, would pay $166 a month for the same Moda Health coverage, and a 60-year-old would see premiums of $352. But the claim holds up if applied only to the younger demographic Cover Oregon is targeting. Of the 12 companies that have published rates, four offer plans for that age group for less than $5 a day. Six more offer coverage ranging from $5.06 to $5.95. The others cost $6.08 and $6.96. It’s also important to note that, at this point, nine of the companies offer catastrophic-only plans that, for the most part, are well below the $130 per month premiums charged by Moda Health. So is the question that simple? We wanted a little more context, so we asked Cox how the campaign came about. It is, indeed, aimed at younger people, he said in a telephone interview. That’s why the ads, showing the image of a steaming cup of coffee with "$5" stamped on the front, appear only on Internet sites likely to be viewed by so-called Millennials. And bringing "vanilla soy latte" into the discussion? "It’s more of an appeal to younger people," Cox said. "Plus, Portland is known for its coffee. We thought it was relevant both to the geography and the demographic." Jesse Ellis O’Brien, a health care advocate with the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said Cover Oregon’s campaign makes sense. "For Cover Oregon to succeed, it has to have a balanced risk pool so people buying coverage in the marketplace aren’t just unhealthy folks buying coverage to take care of their immediate expensive medical needs," O’Brien said. "This is certainly one way for them to try to balance out who is buying insurance on the exchange." The ad is aimed at Millennials, and the ones who see it are likely to know their way around a fancy cup of coffee well enough to get the comparison to insurance coverage. In addition, one-third of the plans with published rates on Cover Oregon offer coverage to this group for less than the cost of a "$5 vanilla soy latte." But words matter, and the ad’s message wouldn’t be accurate for many. Most older people will need to shell out considerably more than $5 a day to buy insurance through Cover Oregon.

pomt-15016	"100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/oct/06/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-all-crime-estimate-committed-15-p/	Urging a positive view of law officers "that you and your family depend on every day," Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on to say the vast majority of citizens are law-abiding. He put precise numbers on that. "You know," Patrick said during a Sept. 2, 2015, interview with David Brown of the Texas Standard, a statewide news affairs program based at KUT, the NPR affiliate in Austin, "100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population." (We have regularly talked about our fact checks on the program.) A curious listener emailed us. Could Patrick's 100/15 statement be so? Patrick’s backup Asked how Patrick reached his figures, his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by email that Patrick "uses 15% as the number of citizens that commit 100% of crime as an indicator of the number of criminals in the total population to make the point that most citizens are law-abiding. That is higher than statistics would indicate," Garcia said, writing that according to law enforcement data, "we have approximately 2.2 million people in jail in America and another 5 million on probation and parole. That is roughly 2.5% of the total population that has been convicted of a crime including non-violent drug offenses." Garcia declined to elaborate on how that 2.5 percent justified Patrick’s 15 percent figure. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the Justice Department, said in a December 2014 report that in 2013, 2.2 million people were incarcerated and more than 4.7 million people were under community supervision (on probation or parole). The report further says those counts (which roll in some people not convicted of crimes) equate to 2,830 people per 100,000 U.S. adults, meaning 2.8 percent of U.S. adults were under correctional supervision. That ratio was the lowest since at least 2005, when there were 3,160 people per 100,000 U.S. adults in the "correctional population," the report said. A pair of criminologists told us the numbers offered by Patrick didn’t make a case for the unfamiliar 100/15 formulation. "Gibberish," Candace McCoy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, commented by email, elaborating that the attempt to account for U.S. residents behind bars doesn’t necessarily support what Patrick declared on the air. "I don't know how the two statistics supposedly relate to each other, if at all," McCoy said. Robert Brame, a University of South Carolina professor who has led research into young Americans arrested for non-traffic offenses, said by phone he didn’t see how the backup offered by Patrick "addresses the fraction of the population that’s responsible for the crime problem in the United States.That’s not clear to me." Broadly, Brame and other criminologists we reached said they weren’t aware of a factual way to get to an accurate statement that ‘x’ percent of the population commits all the crime. But there have been studies suggesting a subset of residents commit about half of crimes. Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, said by email: "A routine finding in the criminological literature is that about half of the crime is committed by a very small fraction of the population, around 5-8 percent depending on the sample and methodology used. This finding has been replicated in many different studies around the world. The bottom line is that a small fraction of the offending population is responsible for a great majority of crime." Piquero said most of the studies tracked residents only into late adolescence or early adulthood. The Philadelphia studies and others Since the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for around half of the crimes reported to police. In the seminal "Crime in a Birth Cohort" and a followup study, a team led by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Marvin Wolfgang tracked nearly 10,000 boys born in 1945 and living in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17; they ultimately gauged how often each boy came in contact with police for an offense. One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent of the group, each accounted for five or more offenses, according to police reports. Those boys, Wolfgang wrote, were collectively identified as responsible for 52 percent of all the offenses recorded in the study and, he said, about two-thirds of all violent crimes believed to have been committed by the juveniles. In Patrick-speak, Wolfgang found that 6 percent of juvenile boys accounted for about half of alleged juvenile crimes. The follow-up study, presented in progress in 1982, tracked more than 28,000 boys and girls born in 1958 who lived in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17. Among males, the study found, 61 percent of reported offenses were committed by 1,030 "chronic recidivists," comprising 7 percent of males in the study. That is, 7 percent of the boys accounted for 61 percent of the juvenile offenses. David Farrington, a University of Cambridge professor of psychological criminology reported in 2006 on criminal offenses by 411 South London boys occasionally interviewed by the team starting when the subjects were 8 years old in 1961. The researchers, who also checked criminal records, found that a "small proportion of the study males (7%) were defined as ‘chronic offenders’ because they accounted for about half of all officially recorded offenses" in the study. The most common offenses, they wrote, included thefts, burglaries and car thefts followed by violence, vandalism, fraud and drug abuse. In 2014, Swedish researchers drawing on records accounting for the experiences of 2.5 million people born in that country from 1958 to 1980 reported that from 1973 to 2004, some 1 percent of the population accounted for 63 percent of all violent crime convictions. Researcher Örjan Falk added: "Psychotic disorders are twice as common among repeat offenders as in the general population, but despite this fact they constitute a very small proportion of the repeat offenders." In the United States, Brame in 2011 reported that based on interviews of a representative sample of residents aged 12 to 16 at the end of 1996, some 25 percent to 41 percent of participants had been arrested by the time they turned 23. Brame told us a widely quoted takeaway from the study was that by age 23, around 1 in 3 of people in that age group would have been arrested for a non-traffic offense at least once. Then again, it’s not a good idea, Brame told us, to assume the same figure would apply to young residents nowadays because teen crime and arrest rates were higher in the mid-1990s. Brame said another vital consideration in mulling how much of the population is responsible for all crime is that many crimes go unreported to police. In 2014, according to the 2014 National Crime Victimization Survey, only 37 percent of U.S. property victimizations and only 46 percent of violent victimizations were reported to police. To our inquiry, William Kelly, director of the University of Texas Center for Criminology and Criminal Justice Research, noted that according to the U.S. Sentencing Project, as many as 100 million U.S. residents, which in 2014 would have been equal to 41 percent of the adult population, had a criminal conviction.

pomt-08754	The sales tax increase, if approved, will cost taxpayers "up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/27/sam-rashid/hillsborough-county-sales-tax/	On Nov. 2, voters will be asked to decide a number of ballot questions. One of the most important ones asks Hillsborough County voters if they support raising the sales tax by a penny to pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and road building. If the primary election was any indication, the transit tax question will color the debate in other political contests. One recurring assertion from tax opponents was that the proposed increase will cost taxpayers $300 million a year. It was often infused with the suggestion that all of that money will go toward rail and benefit only Tampa. We decided to test one such statement. It came in the context of Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe’s successful re-election bid. Sharpe has been a leading advocate of the referendum. He had faced a challenge in the Republican primary from former county party leader Josh Burgin, who opposed the tax. Sam Rashid, a conservative activist and transit tax opponent, put out a mid-summer mailer that claimed Sharpe, a previously avowed opponent of new taxes, was seeking to "impose" a huge one. "Up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa," Rashid wrote. Burgin used the $300 million figure repeatedly in his own campaign material. We decided to look at whether $300 million, and the way Rashid couched its use, was accurate. We started with the number itself, asking Rashid where he got it. He told PolitiFact Florida that it was based on his recollection of what existing Hillsborough County sales taxes have produced at their peak, and that he simply tacked on a bit more to account for anticipated growth and inflation. The county has two sales taxes it assesses, both a half-cent charged on goods and some services. One pays for health care for the poor. The other funds such things as roads, jails and the construction of Raymond James Stadium. County records show that revenues from the two sales taxes peaked in 2006 at $107.1 million each. Double that figure to get what a full penny tax would have raised: $214.2 million – quite a bit shy of $300 million. Since then, sales tax revenues have dropped off considerably. Through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the tax was projected to bring in $64.8 million, making Rashid’s figure look like an even greater exaggeration. Rashid gives himself some cover by using the qualifier "up to." He says he was trying to project what the tax will cost annually over its lifetime, and his word choice in the mailer gives that sense. So we asked Kevin Brickey, the economist for Hillsborough County government, when sales tax receipts might reasonably be expected to reach $300 million. Brickey noted such predictions can be debated during stable economic times. The current recession makes it more of a dicey proposition. But Brickey prepared just such an analysis for the county’s transit agency, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, in July. HART would oversee the rail and bus system if the referendum is approved. His analysis was based on a conservative annual growth rate assumption of 4 percent. It estimated that sales tax revenues from a full penny tax will not reach $300 million until fiscal year 2022 – more than a decade after the tax goes into effect. Brickey performed a second analysis for PolitiFact using a 6 percent growth rate, still considered conservative, but one forecasters might typically use under normal circumstances. It shows the $300 million threshold getting crossed in fiscal year 2019. Due to compounding, Brickey predicts that even under a growth scenario of approximately 4 percent, the sales tax would approach $600 million by its 30th year. So under reasonably conservative projections, Rashid’s number is certainly in the ballpark, and arguably understates the long-term cost to taxpayers. But there are problems with Rashid’s assertion because he contends that all the money will go toward rail in Tampa. For one, 25 percent of sales tax revenues would be obligated toward road work. That means that by the second year of the tax, when Brickey estimates it should bring in nearly $200 million, $50 million will go toward road projects that have nothing to do with rail. They are spread throughout the county and are concentrated outside of Tampa by design, particularly in early years. Figuring out how much of the rest will go toward rail, as opposed to buses, presents a greater challenge. Estimates vary from year to year as construction of the rail system progresses and trains start rolling. HART has prepared an analysis of where all the money will go over the next 30 years. But it combines sales tax revenues and money local officials hope to get from the state and federal government in matching dollars, plus property tax revenues, in one pot. Based on those numbers, HART expects to spend about 52 percent of all of its future revenue on rail. Working with Brickey and HART, the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization has prepared a detailed analysis of how the sales tax would be spent through 2035. It shows that, of the 75 percent of the penny tax that would be spent on transit, 57 percent would go toward rail. That represents 43 percent of all projected sales tax expenditures. Even adding in a significant "oops" factor, about half the money would go toward rail. The rest would go toward buses, roads and trails, much if not most of it outside Tampa city limits. These numbers are subject to change. HART is still doing an analysis to determine if rail makes sense along the corridors identified for it. And they’re still determining what specific paths the rail lines would take, which they won’t finish until after the election. That all affects the bottom line. Finally, while it is true that the first two legs of the train system would be within Tampa city limits, there are plans for later expansion outside the city, including a line to Brandon. If Rashid had confined his statement to asserting that the proposed hike would cost taxpayers $300 million a year, we probably would have rated that Mostly True, since it will be soon enough. But he said that it was all going for trains in the city of Tampa. It is true that this whole exercise was largely initiated by Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio, who made building a commuter rail system a top goal. But the discussion ended up in the hands of the County Commission, which ultimately put the question on the ballot. After months of study initiated by Commission Chairman Ken Hagan, a task force recommended that a significant portion of the money go to roads and buses. And that’s the position the County Commission took in crafting the ballot language. So while critics want to label the initiative a rail tax for the city of Tampa that will not benefit suburban residents, PolitiFact finds Rashid’s attempt to frame the issue as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03884	The United States gives $8 million a day to Israel and gives that country a blank check.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/06/council-national-interest/billboards-question-aid-israel/	A message on an electronic billboard in Gwinnett County caught our eye one evening. "$8 million a day to Israel just doesn’t make sense!" it read. Underneath those words, it read: "STOP The Blank Check.org." Does the United States give Israel $8 million a day? Is there a "blank check" for Israel? Since we’ve seen the same message on other billboards in the Atlanta region, PolitiFact Georgia thought it’d be worthwhile to figure out whether the claim is accurate or are the thousands of motorists who’ve seen this billboard being told misleading information. The Council for the National Interest paid for the billboard. The nonprofit organization’s goal, according to its website, is support of a just resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It has claimed, for example, that the news media devotes more coverage to Israeli deaths rather than Palestinian deaths in Middle East violence. Some groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, say the council is anti-Israel and claims some leaders of its educational arm have met in recent years with terrorist leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. The council’s executive director, Phil Giraldi, said the group, based in northern Virginia, has about 12,000 members. The group is paying for 10 billboards in the Atlanta area and six others nationwide, he said. Giraldi said he got a good deal on billboards in Atlanta. "We wanted to make the public aware at a time that budgets are being cut, aid to Israel is not," said Giraldi, who added that Israel has a "booming" economy. "Whenever Israel needs more money, Congress appropriates it," he said. The council’s website describes Giraldi as a former CIA counterterrorism specialist. Giraldi recently wrote a column called "Why I Dislike Israel" that criticized the U.S.-Israel relationship as too cozy and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was meddling in the 2012 U.S. presidential race. The nonpartisan, federal Congressional Research Service released a report in 2012 on U.S. foreign aid to Israel. Most of what the United States gives Israel is military aid. The report found the U.S. gave more aid to Israel than any other nation between 1976 and 2004. Afghanistan is currently at the top of the list, the report said. Israel uses almost 75 percent of those funds to buy U.S. defense equipment. By law, Congress must be notified of most new purchase agreements. Over the years, the two nations have had occasional disputes over which weapons that contain U.S. materials can be sold to other nations. In the mid-1990s, the CRS noted, following efforts in Congress to reduce foreign aid funding, Israel proposed (and Congress agreed) to phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel entirely. As Congress phased out economic aid to Israel from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, military aid gradually increased, according to the CRS. President Barack Obama proposed spending $3.1 billion in military financing for Israel and an additional $15 million on refugee resettlement for fiscal year 2013, a 12-month period that will end Sept. 30. That’s nearly $8.5 million a day. It’s unclear what impact the sequester may have on aid to Israel. End of story? Not yet. We were still curious about whether the United States has written a blank check to Israel, since "STOP The Blank Check.org" is mentioned so prominently on the billboard. Israel is considered one of America’s closest allies, and politicians who do not strongly support that relationship do so at their own peril. A Pew Research Center poll in December found about 50 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians, while just 10 percent side with the Palestinians. For much of Obama’s first term, Republicans accused the president of damaging ties with Israel because of disagreements between his administration and the Israeli government over issues such as Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Obama’s critics also complained he hadn’t visited Israel since he took office. The president may visit Israel as soon as this month, according to some Israeli news accounts. Some say there is no willingness in Washington to question Israel or America’s funding for it. "There is no debate," said M.J. Rosenberg, director of the Washington office of the Israel Policy Forum, a left-wing organization that pushes for peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Then, according to the Jerusalem Post, he corrected himself, saying, "The debate is like this: ‘I like Israel.’ ‘Well, I like Israel more.’ " Philip Wilcox, president of the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace, said he has seen the $8 million a day claim and agreed "it’s in the ballpark." As for whether there is a "blank check" for Israel, Wilcox told us that the U.S. generally accepts Israeli military actions in the region. Wilcox spent years working in the federal government on Middle East affairs. He noted, though, that the U.S. has conducted inquiries into Israeli use of weapons. "This is really a matter of interpretation," Wilcox said of whether there is a blank check. Giraldi cited Obama’s decision to fund Israel’s "Iron Dome" missile defense program as part of the blank check to Israel claim. In fiscal year 2011, the White House approved $205 million for the program. In July, the president provided an additional $70 million for the program. "The United States being one-sided to Israel is not beneficial to the United States," Giraldi said. Our conclusion: The council’s billboard says the U.S. gives $8 million a day to Israel. In essence, that’s an accurate estimate. The billboard may leave the impression that there is a blank check to Israel. That’s a matter of interpretation. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-05783	"It’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is now to buy a gun..."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/27/janet-howell/sen-janet-howell-says-its-easier-guns-virginia-vot/	State Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, recently complained about socially conservative bills being approved this winter by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. During a Feb. 10 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation, Howell called the GOP majority "a steamroller" in passing legislation to ease gun control laws and strengthen voter identification requirements. "What’s really ironic with what’s happening is it’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they’re doing on gun control issues," she said. Is it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in Virginia? Howell told us her statement was a "rhetorical slur." She cited some of bills that have been approved by the General Assembly this year but did not offer a point-by-point comparison of the requirements to buy a gun or cast a vote. So we looked at Virginia’s laws overseeing firearm purchases and voting. You have to be at least 18 for either activity. You have to be a state resident to vote in Virginia. But you don’t have to live in Virginia to buy a gun here. Let’s examine the other requirements. Identification To register to vote, you must present a document that shows your name and address. It can be a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document. To cast a ballot, you must show identification or sign a statement -- subject to felony conviction for false information -- that you are the registered voter you represent yourself to be. This requirement is being altered by the General Assembly this year, a point we’ll address later. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in Virginia, you must show primary and secondary forms of identification. The primary document must be a state-issued photo ID. The secondary identification just needs to contain your current address and can be a utility bill, voter registration card, bank check or hunting or fishing license. But in the case of private guns sales -- if you buy a firearm from an individual who is not a licensed dealer -- the identification requirements go away. Application To register to vote, you must fill out and submit an application 22 days before a general or primary election. The form can be submitted at variety of locations or by mail. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer, you have to submit to a computerized background check run by the state police. It’s usually completed in a matter of minutes, but can take as long as four days. The background check does not apply to private gun sales, and such transactions can occur instantly. Disqualification You can’t vote if you are a felon and have not had your rights restored, or if you have been judged mentally incapacitated. Many things could turn up on a background check that would bar someone from buying a gun from a licensed dealer. They include conviction or indictment on felony charges, an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor or felony, outstanding protective or restraining orders, use of illegal drugs, mental incompetency judgement, orders for mental health treatment, dishonorable discharge from military, and conviction on domestic violence charges. In private sales, it is a felony to knowingly sell a gun to a person who would be disqualified under the instant background check. But there is no onus on a private seller to inquire about a buyer’s background, and no requirement that a purchaser disclose whether he or she is legally qualified to buy a firearm in Virginia. What could change As Howell noted in her interview with Sharpton, the General Assembly has passed several bills this year affecting voting and gun purchases. The major change in voting concerns what happens if voters don’t have identification when they show up at the polls on Election Day. Instead of signing an affidavit and having their vote counted immediately, anyone who can’t present ID would turn in a provisional ballot. Local electoral boards meet the day after the election to determine which of the votes are valid. But this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun. You would have no hope of buying a gun from a licensed dealer if you did not present identification. And you still won’t need ID to buy a gun for a private dealer. So the comparison doesn’t change. Legislators have also repealed a law limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Many exceptions have been put in the law since passed in 1993. But the repeal would not change the requirements for buying a gun in the first place, it will allow you to buy more each time you clear the hurdles. Our ruling Howell said it is becoming harder to vote in Virginia than buy a gun.. There are more restrictions on buying a gun from a licensed dealer than voting. The firearm purchase requires more identification. The gun buyer has to go through a background check that the voter does not. And you can be more easily disqualified from buying a gun than you can be from voting. But there are fewer barriers to buying a gun privately than there are to voting. The private gun sale requires no wait, no identification, and no easily enforceable disqualifications. We rate Howell’s statement Half True.

pomt-02759	"Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/13/generation-opportunity/will-affordable-care-act-close-down-volunteer-fire/	Editor's note: Almost two months after we published this report, the Obama administration clarified guidelines on volunteer fire departments. The new rules specifically exempt volunteer fire and rescue units. Read our story that details the new guidelines. Our original report from December is below. Few things tug on the heart strings, or put fear in people’s minds, like the image of a small town losing its volunteer fire station. So you can imagine why a number of readers alerted us to a Facebook post making the rounds that alleged just that. According to a graphic posted by Generation Opportunity, an organization that opposes the Affordable Care Act through outreach to young people, the health care law will have an adverse effect on volunteer emergency services. "Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service," the post alleges, "or close entirely!" As of Dec. 12, the post had nearly 4,000 shares, 2,500 "Likes," and dozens of comments. We’ve heard plenty of claims about the Affordable Care Act and its effect on employers, but hadn’t looked into how it treats volunteer fire stations. Ask and you shall receive, readers. What’s at issue There actually is quite a bit of uncertainty regarding the health care law and how it addresses local volunteer emergency services. The employer mandate in the law states that employers with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees must provide health insurance to their workers. If not, they face a stiff penalty of $2,000 for every worker after 30. There are 783,300 volunteer firefighters in the United States and nearly 25,500 stations are either entirely or mostly made up of volunteers, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Some of them are small, serve rural areas, and are made up of a handful of volunteers. They’re not likely to be affected by the law. Then there’s the question of hours worked. The law specifies that a full-time employee works at least 30 hours a week. Many volunteers wouldn’t hit that threshold, though it is unclear how hours would be counted. Does it include time spent on call or fundraising for the department? The National Volunteer Fire Council is concerned that the employer mandate will still apply to many stations. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Service considers a volunteer an employee for tax purposes. "It does not matter whether firefighters are termed ‘volunteers,’ are considered employees, or are identified by any other name, if the work they do is subject to the will and control of the payer, under the common-law rules, they are employees for federal tax purposes," according to the IRS. That allows any benefits a volunteer firefighter receives to be taxed. And while the U.S. Department of Labor has tight restrictions on the benefits (mostly awarded to cover the costs of travel and equipment for the job) a volunteer can receive, so far the IRS has not said whether it will treat them as employees or volunteers under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released draft regulations last year for the employer mandate. There was no mention of volunteer fire services. "The more we looked at the law we saw there’s nothing in this that says the IRS has to listen to the Department of Labor," said Dave Finger, director of government relations for the National Volunteer Fire Council, an organization representing volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. "Around the spring we realized this could be a significant problem for our folks. Finger added that most volunteer fire stations serve sparsely populated areas that don’t have a large tax base. Some even get their revenue from pancake breakfast fundraisers. Finding the resources to suddenly pay for health insurance or the fee would be very difficult. Some stations employ more than 50 volunteers, some volunteers lend their time to stations operated by county or municipal governments with more than 50 employees, and others band together and can surpass the mandate threshold that way. Under any of these scenarios, volunteer departments are worried they could be required to offer health insurance. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, and both sides of the aisle, agree that the law is vague and could potentially affect volunteer units. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., has introduced a bill in the House that would exempt volunteer forces from the employer mandate, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has asked the Senate to do the same. "(The Treasury) put out regulations that didn’t include this," said Elizabeth Falcone, a legislative assistant in Warner’s office. "It wasn’t clear it was going to be dealt with and revised. There’s a history of showing why strong force is important (to get action from IRS). "When there’s ambiguity you need to create certainty," she added. "And that’s the issue. That’s what we’re trying to fix." How big is the problem? But let’s get back to what the graphic said: The Affordable Care Act could "force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!" We reached out to Generation Opportunity to get clarity on the severity of the accusation. They didn’t reply to our call. But both Warner’s office and the National Volunteer Fire Council felt that was a big leap. "That sounds like the predictable messaging you would hear about these issues," said Kevin Hall, spokesman for Warner. "In Virginia, we have a highly organized and professional volunteer fire team in Virginia Beach, and they sniff at this as being a nonissue. But there is concern in some communities and they’re seeking help in getting more definitive guidance." It’s also worth noting that most volunteers have other full-time jobs, Finger said, and would receive health benefits from their employer or the government. Additionally, many stations don’t come close to reaching the 50-employee threshold, no matter how the IRS chooses to count them. It would also require the IRS to go out and enforce the law and target volunteer fire stations. While "it’s a worst-case scenario that you can’t rule out," Finger said he thought department closures were "unlikely" and thousands of closures were "very unlikely." There’s no doubt that if the employer mandate is applied to volunteer fire departments it would mean additional costs for those that qualify. But it’s more likely departments will decrease their workforce or cut and cap other benefits volunteer forces receive, before slashing services or closing stations, Finger said. For their part, the Treasury Department said it was taking the concerns of volunteer firefighters and other emergency services into account as it works toward the final employer mandate regulations, though they could not say when that would be. President Barack Obama has also delayed the employer mandate for a year, so it won’t go into effect until 2015. And Warner’s office said the cast of support he has recruited for his bill, including two Democrats, two Republicans and an independent, "was noteworthy to people in White House," and they expected action sooner than later. Finger echoed those sentiments. "We’re telling our members: ‘One, we think it’s going to be fixed,’" he said. "‘And two, no penalties are coming until 2015, so it’s still a long way off. Don’t do anything drastic now.’" Our ruling The Facebook post said "Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!" "Could" is a dangerous word that allows rabble rousers to generate hysteria without being completely false, but we think it’s somewhat inflated. There certainly is cause for concern, but even those looking to change the status quo see this as an exaggeration. Furthermore, it sounds like those in the know expect the issue to be resolved now that pressure is mounting. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it as Half True.	None	Generation Opportunity	None	None	None	2013-12-13T16:17:43	2013-12-10	['None']
pomt-07624	Says "for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/19/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-says-portlands-spent-its-/	Portland’s biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, we’re Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget. You’d think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure. But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back. "You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America," he says. "Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure." Could that be true? We checked it out. Our first stop was the mayor’s office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the city’s bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the city’s bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars. When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Here’s how they arrived at that figure: "We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed. "For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment." To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: "The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all." We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects. He confirmed it did, adding: "I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates." The one thing Geller said it didn’t include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said. Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky. The cost of a mile of freeway isn’t easy to pin down. The mayor’s office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the city’s data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors. They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. "Of course," Geller wrote in the original e-mail, "it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million." Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range. According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such: -Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile. -Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile. -Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile; $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile. We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation. So, where does that put us with our ruling? It seems to us that Geller’s estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didn’t make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway. That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When you’re talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost. The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny. We’ll give this one a Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2011-03-19T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['None']
pomt-03420	Says unsuccessful Texas abortion legislation "was supported by a majority of" Texans.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/27/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-majority-texans-support-faile/	A Republican official declared that abortion legislation that perished amid shouting from the Texas Senate gallery was nevertheless popular across Texas. After a special legislative session ended without Senate Bill 5 advancing from the Texas Senate to Gov. Rick Perry, Jerry Patterson said in an email blast: "Late last night, a bill supported by a majority of the Texas Legislature and a majority of Texans, was shouted down by a rude, unruly mob who decided that the legislative process is only worthwhile when it produces something they support." Patterson, the state land commissioner, sent the June 26, 2013, blast on behalf of his 2014 campaign for lieutenant governor. Other expected candidates include the incumbent, David Dewhurst, and Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, both Republicans. In the email, Patterson followed up his reference to the legislation’s popularity by suggesting the current lieutenant governor, who typically presides over the Senate, deserves blame for the "breakdown of decorum and procedure." That’s an opinion; we focused the Truth-O-Meter on whether the legislation, which was backed by a majority of the Republican-dominated Legislature, had the support of a majority of Texans. As summarized in a June 24, 2013, Associated Press news article, the measure would require all abortions to take place in surgical centers, facilities designed to cope with major surgeries that could lead to life-threatening complications. As it stands, the story said, the majority of abortions are not surgical procedures, and 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics do not meet the intended standard. The bill also would require abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they work, the AP said. Finally, the proposal as amended by the Texas House would restrict abortions after 20 weeks, shaving four weeks off current law. By email, Patterson told us that a recent poll by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune showed 62 percent of Texans supporting or strongly supporting the prospect of limiting abortions that occur after the 20th week of pregnancy. According to a June 20, 2013, Tribune news article on the poll, 62 percent said they would support "prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks." The poll, taken from May 30, 2013, through June 13, 2013, with help from California-based YouGov, sampled 1,200 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent. The Tribune reported that nearly half — 47 percent — said they would strongly support those prohibition. Its article continued: "It’s a strongly partisan issue, however, with 85 percent of Republicans in favor of the ban and nearly half of the Democrats against it. Fewer than 10 percent of Republicans oppose the 20-week ban; fewer than two in five Democrats support it." More broadly, the Tribune said, the poll indicated a general divide on abortion that it described as evident in past polls. "Some 46 percent of Texas voters say it should never be permitted or permitted only in cases involving incest, rape or when the woman's life is in danger," the article said, while "49 percent say it should be allowed after the need for an abortion has been clearly established, or that the choice should be completely left to the woman. Within those numbers, 16 percent said abortion should never be allowed, and 36 percent said that a woman should always be able to get an abortion as a matter of personal choice." By telephone, UT’s Jim Henson, the poll’s co-director, said the poll did not ask respondents directly about the proposal that ultimately fell short of final approval in the Senate. Nor, Henson said, were there questions touching on the bill’s provisions for abortion clinics to meet surgical hospital standards and for each provider physician to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital. "There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban," Henson said. We searched for other recent polls of Texans about abortion or the legislation, finding only a survey by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Washington-based firm whose leaders include Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. In the poll of 601 registered voters, some 52 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the firm said in a June 20, 2013, summary, with 39 percent saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The survey, taken June 17-19, 2013, had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. And the poll included a query about whether respondents would favor or oppose a proposal described as introduced by Perry and under consideration in the special session. The survey said: "This proposal would put in place new restrictions and regulations on abortion providers that would likely result in the closure of all but five abortion clinics in the state of Texas, all of which are located along the I-35 corridor, and would ban most abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy." In response, 42 percent somewhat or strongly favored the proposal with 51 percent somewhat or strongly opposing it, the firm said, while 7 percent did not know or did not respond. We noticed, though, that the question was preceded by inquiries arguably intended to stir respondents' concerns. For instance, the poll's first opinion question spoke to whether respondents thought women’s access to health care is "being threatened in Texas." The next query asked if the special session should focus on issues like education, jobs and the economy "instead of bringing up social issues like abortion that were already addressed" in the 2013 regular session. Farther along, the questions immediately before the one about the abortion proposal asked if the person trusted or didn’t trust Perry and the Legislature to "make decisions" about women’s health care; 57 percent said not. By email and telephone, Patterson told us he has seen no poll of Texans on anything but the 20-week provision. "The pro-choice folks focus solely on the ‘access’ issue," Patterson said, referring to criticism that the stepped-up medical standards will lead to clinics closing. But, he said, the 20-weeks’ provision became the most salient part of the legislation after it was restored to the measure in the House. "Ask anyone you know if they're ‘comfortable’ with abortions after 20 weeks," he said. He later added that a majority of voters might favor the measure’s required hospital standards. "But that’s conjecture," he said. Our ruling Patterson said the majority of Texans supported the abortion measure that died. Yet he did not offer nor did we find public polls covering every element of the legislation, though the GQR poll stretched to two elements of the legislation, seemingly finding a majority of Texans in opposition--though the poll struck us as laden with phrasing likely to encourage qualms about anti-abortion measures. Patterson’s statement has an element of truth in that 62 percent of respondents in the UT/Texas Tribune poll specifically supported barring abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the proposal angled to do. But the lack of other backup evidence leaves the overall claim Mostly False.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2013-06-27T06:00:00	2013-06-26	['Texas']
pomt-09278	"Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/28/allen-west/west-says-nearly-half-americans-pay-no-taxes/	Allen West, a Republican candidate for Congress for the South Florida seat now held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, claims that close to half of Americans aren't paying "any taxes." On a page about the economy on his Web site, West claims, "Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes." That's a strong claim -- that nearly half of Americans aren't paying "any taxes." We wondered, could that be true? First, a look at the context in which West made this claim. He made it in a section that focuses on income taxes -- though he said "any taxes": "If we are serious about restoring the American economy then suspend payroll taxes until the situation improves. I would begin with a 3 month suspension and willingly extend that to 6 months if necessary. In order to inspire investment, innovation, ingenuity, and real growth we must end capital gains, dividend, and death taxes, just abolish immediately. We should begin to redefine our tax code, no more progressive tax system; we need to go to a flat tax system. Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes; a (flat tax) rate of around 15-17% would be adequate. A twist I recommend is to have a flat tax up to an income level of $2 Million, then institute a progressive system. My intent is to inspire Americans to earn and develop their wealth.: The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes federal income tax issues, found the number was actually 36.3 percent based on tax year 2008 filed in 2009. The figure refers to federal income taxes. "We found that out of the 142 million tax returns filed, roughly 51.6 million paid no income taxes or had negative income tax liability,'' said spokesperson Natasha Altamirano in an interview April 26, 2010. That equals 36.3 percent "who paid no income taxes or got additional money through refundable tax credits" and she added the 2008 numbers are actually the record high. Altamirano said that it's important be precise in describing that group. "One of the problems is when people say 'half of everyone, one-third of everyone does not pay taxes' -- that's not true,'' she said, because it omits other types of taxes such as property and sales taxes that those people still pay. "This is just federal income tax. Unless they are saying 'federal income taxes' it's just not true.'' Another measure: According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, 46.9 percent of Americans paid no federal income taxes for 2009, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. We read him Allen West's quote about 40 to 45 percent of Americans not paying "any taxes," and Williams said: "That's not true at all." People who don't pay income taxes probably pay taxes in many other ways such as state and local sales tax and state and federal taxes on gasoline and alcohol. To avoid paying taxes entirely, "you couldn't drink, you couldn't smoke, you couldn't drive a car, you couldn't live in a house,'' Williams said. "It's hard to avoid them. We are very careful when we say 47 percent pay no federal income tax." West campaign spokeswoman Valentina Weis said West was referring to federal income tax. "This paragraph refers to Allen's position on the federal income tax, and it has been well documented that the mentioned percentage (actually quoted higher in some instances, 47 percent) do not pay any federal income taxes,'' she wrote in an e-mail. We spoke to West, who also told us that his claim referred to federal income taxes. When asked why he didn't state "federal income taxes" rather than "any tax" he said: "I presume people are smart enough to know what I'm talking about because I'm running for federal office,'' he said in an interview. West's campaign provided links to an editorial in USA Today and articles from CNN, the AP and Business Insider which cite the 47 percent figure. West's statement was made within a paragraph in which he discussed taxes, including several aspects of the income tax, but it appeared on a page about the economy that covered a range of financial issues including the "death tax," sub-prime mortgages and foreign aid. If West meant to say 40 to 45 percent of Americans don't pay "federal income taxes," he could have been more specific. As it is currently worded, the sentence is not specific and can lead people to believe he was referring to all types of taxes. So for the lack of important context, we rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09854	AARP is "endorsing" the health care reform bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/barack-obama/obama-goes-too-far-when-he-says-health-reform-bill/	With polls showing seniors are the most skeptical about the health care reform bills working their way through Congress, President Barack Obama sought to ease some of their concerns during a town hall meeting with a little high-powered name-dropping. The name: AARP. Several times at the town hall in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, Obama specifically mentioned AARP's support for health care reform. It's little wonder why: The AARP is the country's largest and most powerful advocate for seniors. "We have the AARP on board because they know this is a good deal for our seniors," Obama said at one point. And later, in response to a question about whether the health care plan would reduce the availability of medications through Medicare, Obama said, "Well, first of all, another myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits. We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay?" It was that last comment that caught the attention of AARP executives. Not the part that AARP would not support a bill that undermines Medicare benefits. That's true. It was the suggestion that AARP had formally endorsed any particular version of the still-evolving health care plan working its way through Congress. AARP chief operating officer Tom Nelson immediately fired off a press release saying that "indications that we have endorsed any of the major health care reform bills currently under consideration in Congress are inaccurate." The rebuke likely confused a lot of AARP members who have read or heard numerous AARP statements in recent weeks that have supported various aspects of the health care plan. Just a few weeks ago, on July 14, the AARP issued a press release gushing about the introduction of the House health care reform bill saying, "This bill would make great strides for all of our members and their families." The group said it was pleased with the legislation for giving "every American has access to affordable, quality health care choices." Specifically, the release said the bill would make prescription drugs less expensive for seniors, would block insurance companies from denying coverage based on age, and for capping out-of-pocket expenses for some insurance plans. AARP did not explicitly say it was endorsing the bill, but there was not a single negative comment in the statement. In a July 14 ad sponsored by Healthy Economy Now — a coalition including AARP, the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry, among others — the tone was decidedly upbeat. "The president and Congress have a plan to lower costs and stop denials for pre-existing conditions," the ad says. "It's time to act." The following day, AARP released a statement about the version of the bill being debated in the Senate. This time, the group was slightly less complimentary; while it said most parts of the legislation were good, AARP remained concerned about a provision in the bill that would prevent some generic drugs from entering the market faster. Since then, the climate in the health care debate has taken a decided nasty turn, with a deep and clear divide between Republicans and Democrats. But AARP spokesman Jim Dau said AARP was not reacting by tempering its stance. He said AARP supports a lot of changes that both the House and Senate bills would make, such as making drugs cheaper for seniors and ending discriminatory practices against the elderly, but the group has been clear all along that it has not endorsed any of the big bills. "We have endorsed specific measures," Dau said. "We're praising the pieces that we think are good for members." Dau pointed to a statement made by AARP CEO Barry Rand during a July 28 town hall meeting with Obama. "I want to make it clear that AARP has not endorsed any particular bill, any of the bills that are being circulated around Congress today and debated in Congress today," Rand said. "We continue to work with the members on both sides of the aisle, and we continue to work with the administration to achieve what is right for health care reform." Nelson echoed that bipartisan tone in his statement after Obama's town hall this week. "AARP has been working with Democrats and Republicans to fix our broken health care system," Nelson stated. "AARP supports specific measures that would help older Americans and their families – including bipartisan proposals to create a new follow-up care benefit in Medicare that would help prevent hospital readmissions, as well as to address the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the ‘doughnut hole.’ We also support the need for lawmakers and the administration to act this year to fix what doesn’t work in the health care system." So was Obama incorrect to say the AARP had endorsed the bill? The July 14 statement sure sounds to us like an endorsement, even if it didn't specifically contain that word. But in Washington, the word "endorse" means you have put the weight of your name behind an official stamp of approval for a bill, candidate or policy. And the fact is, AARP has not formally endorsed any specific bill. It strongly supports some aspects of the bills. But that's not a formal endorsement. And in fact, Obama was present two weeks ago when AARP's CEO said the group "has not endorsed any particular bill." So we rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09324	"The permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/julian-assange/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-tells-colbert-per/	In an April 12, 2010, interview on The Colbert Report, one of the WikiLeaks founders was pressed to explain why "Collateral Murder" was an accurate title for a leaked military video of a 3-year-old deadly encounter between a U.S. Apache helicopter gun crew and a cluster of men on a Baghdad street corner, two of whom were journalists for Reuters. Host Stephen Colbert called the title "emotional manipulation." He noted that while soldiers in the Apache did mistake cameras with long telephoto lenses slung over the shoulders of the two journalists for weapons, there were, in fact, two other men in the group with weapons. "How can you call it 'Collateral Murder?' " Colbert asked guest Julian Assange of Wikileaks, referring to the controversial and widely-viewed video. "So it appears there are possibly two men, one carrying an AK-47 and one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade -- although we're not 100 percent sure of that -- in the crowd," Assange answered. "However, the permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used and before the Reuters cameraman, Namir Noor-Eldeen, ever pulled up his camera and went around the corner." Assange is referring to a moment in the video when a Reuters cameraman peers from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. A soldier on the Apache yells "He's got an RPG!" According to a military investigation several days later, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and "due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers." It's true that that's the first time the word "RPG" is uttered by the Apache crew in the unedited 40-minute version of the video. And it's also true that the permission to engage was given prior to that. But that doesn't mean the group of men on the street was believed to be unarmed prior to that, or that U.S. troops were given permission to shoot at a group of what they believed to be unarmed men. Let's walk through some of the early minutes of the the video, and accompanying audio, that comes via an Apache gun camera, to check Assange's claim. When the soldiers spot the group, the gun camera zeroes in on Noor-Eldeen, with the camera slung over his right shoulder. "There's one, yeah," says one of the crew members on the Apache. "Oh yeah," says another. "That's a weapon," the soldier says. "Yeah." Behind Noor-Eldeen is the other Reuters journalist, also with a camera. But then the cross-hairs in the camera pan to a couple of the other men farther back in the group. "Yep, he's got a weapon too," the soldier says. The soldier radios back, "Have 5 to 6 individuals with AK-47s. Request permission to engage." "Roger that...You are free to engage. Over." At that point, however, the helicopter has apparently circled around, and the group is no longer visible behind a wall. That's when we see the crouching journalist peek around the corner, pointing the camera. "He's got an RPG!" a soldier in the Apache yells. Moments later, the Apache circles back around the building, getting the men in full view, and the shooting begins. An investigative report prepared by the military includes several still photos taken from the gun camera video. One shows the two journalists with the cameras, and the report concludes they "could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press." In addition, the report includes a still photo of the men a little father back, the ones who appeared to have prompted the comments "Yep, he's got a weapon, too." Entered as Exhibit B, the investigator placed red circles around what he concluded was two men "openly displaying an RPG and an AKM, while a third individual carries what appears to be an RPG round." Assange agreed on The Colbert Report that it appears one of the men was carrying an RPG launcher, and another an AK-47, but that the video is not entirely conclusive. The military investigative report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies. In an interview with PolitiFact, Assange correctly pointed out that military investigators state definitively that the Apache soldiers had identified men with weapons, "AK-47s and a RPG," though the crew had not actually said the word RPG prior to asking for permission to engage. The report states that men on the street were observed with "weapons consistent with reports of hostile acts conducted against friendly forces" and that they had "satisfied all requirements to initiate an engagement." The report also mentions that the man peering around the side of the building (with what turned out to be a camera) appeared to be a sign of "hostile intent." Again, that happened after permission to engage had already been granted. Assange called that "retrospective justification." When Assange points out in the context of justifying the title "Collateral Murder" that the word "RPG" was not used until after the permission to engage was given, he leaves the impression that the soldiers were given the okay to open fire on a group of unarmed men, or men believed to be unarmed. But the video and accompanying audio make clear that the soldiers in the helicopter said they spotted "weapons" among those in the group -- later identified by an army investigator as an AK-47 and an RPG -- and that they mistook two cameras with telephoto lenses as weapons as well. Assange said he does not accept that his comment makes that implication, that introductory text in the video clearly states, "Although some of the men appear to have been armed, the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed." Who can say whether those in the Apache meant RPG when the crosshairs turned to two of the other men in the group -- not journalists -- and they said "he's got a weapon, too." Photographs suggest that it probably was a man with an RPG, and another with an AK-47 rifle. Still, the soldiers in the Apache reported, "Five to six individuals with AK-47s." That's what the permission to engage appears to have been based upon. RPG's were not specifically referred to by that point, but other "weapons" were. And so while Assange's statement is technically accurate, we think it leaves out critical context. And we rule it Half True.	None	Julian Assange	None	None	None	2010-04-14T19:55:17	2010-04-12	['None']
pomt-01114	"There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ "	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/08/craig-melvin/msnbc-host/	We admit to feeling like we’ve heard it all before when it comes to debate on long-stalled immigration reform in Congress. Recently, though, we heard something new -- and if true, shocking -- in a little-noticed segment after the winter holidays. NBC News correspondent Craig Melvin was talking about the implications of the House speaker’s race for immigration policy and federal funding of immigration enforcement during the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of The Rundown with Jose Diaz-Balart (Melvin was filling in as host). The border is more secure since President Barack Obama took over, Melvin said, adding that some Republicans have actually conceded that things are going well in that department. "There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ Is that not accurate?" Melvin asked his guests. We decided to check if it was. Did GOP members, who have made securing the border a priority over any type of amnesty, actually say they wouldn’t know where to place more Border Patrol agents if they approved the money? Melvin referred us to a Dec. 26 interview he conducted for MSNBC with Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky. Yarmuth is a Democrat, not a Republican, and a member of the House’s "gang" of eight who worked on a bipartisan immigration solution in 2013. The Senate had its own gang of eight; neither resulted in a law. Yarmuth told Melvin that Obama had done much to secure the border, and there were guards aplenty. Key to this fact-check, he relayed what he said were the words of two Texas Republicans. "Illegal border crossings are about half what they were before the Obama administration took over. We have as many Border Patrol people on guard as we can possibly need. I was part of the group of eight in the House, the bipartisan group that worked on immigration reform during the last Congress, and our Texas members basically said we would not know where to put more border guards right now." So Melvin’s comments come from Yarmuth, who says they came from two Texas members serving on the House’s gang of eight -- Republican Reps. John Carter and Sam Johnson. PunditFact reached out to Carter and Johnson several times and heard nothing back from their staff. Yarmuth’s office, meanwhile, didn’t offer us more details behind his comments. So we have very little to go on other than one congressman’s word, which was then repeated by an MSNBC host. But that doesn’t quite put us at a dead end. We can say we found no record of Carter or Johnson making the type of comment Yarmuth said they did in public. In fact, we found evidence of the opposite. Carter and Johnson left the immigration policy group in September 2013, announcing in a joint press release that they had "a lack of faith" in Obama’s enforcement approach and would support their GOP colleagues’ approach that "starts with a genuinely secure border." In an Aug. 11, 2014, interview with Fox Business Network, Carter made the case for additional border patrol agents along the Southern border. "We have to put resources on the border," Carter said. "Fencing, experience along the Rio Grande, is a very difficult issue because that's a very windy river, awfully hard to build. And remember, in Texas, we have private property that borders on our border in Texas. So all that fencing would have to be done on private property. "We need to put the resources, the human resources, out there. I'm proud of our governor for sending our Texas Department of Public Safety down there, and a massive amount, and also, the willingness to use the Texas National Guard, both of which will assist an overwhelmed and very dedicated border patrol." And a month earlier, Johnson issued a July 2014 statement calling on additional border patrol agents. "As it is the responsibility of the federal government to secure our borders, Washington must do so now and send more border patrol agents to Texas. I will continue working to ensure Texas has the resources and manpower it needs to secure the border. It can and must be done." We should note that both of these comments came at a time when many were upset by the influx of children crossing the border from Central America. The comments, however, came months before Yarmuth and then Melvin said the opposite. Victor Manjarrez, associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he never heard Carter or Johnson say the border didn’t need more manpower. "Quite honestly that would be a little shocking to hear members of Congress from Texas saying that," Manjarrez said. "You typically have members of Congress want to throw resources at you." On the other hand, members of the federal enforcement community deemed a proposal to double the number of Border Patrol agents to about 39,000 unnecessary, said Manjarrez, who retired from the Border Patrol in May 2011 as a sector chief in Tucson, Ariz. After the Sept. 11 attacks, when border enforcement was moved to the newly created Department of Homeland Security, the number of border patrol agents doubled from about 2,000 in the 2002 fiscal year to more than 20,800 as of the 2014 fiscal year (a small decrease from 2013). Another doubling of resources within a year or so would be drastic, he said. "When they talk about doubling the size of Border Patrol last year ... just from my previous experience and my peers that won’t be allowed to talk, that was really overkill," Manjarrez said. Our ruling Melvin said, "There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ " Melvin got his information from an interview he conducted with a Democratic congressman who quoted two Texas Republicans as saying as much. But there is no public record of the two Texas Republicans, Reps. Carter and Johnson, saying remarks along those lines that we could find. While it may have transpired behind closed doors, we have no evidence that it did. What we do know is that both Texas congressmen have more recently advocated for additional border patrol agents, a fact that neither Yarmuth or Melvin mentioned. For Melvin, he accurately recounted what he heard. But in this game of telephone, all we get is a busy signal at the other end. Because of a lack of evidence, and the public comments of Carter and Johnson, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03217	Says President Barack Obama could "basically" legalize all immigrants here illegally "by the sign of a pen."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fears-obama-could-basically-legalize-a/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has a dire message for conservatives who oppose immigration reform: Do something to improve the status quo, or President Barack Obama could make the situation much worse. "I’ve been saying now I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen," Rubio said in a recent interview with Tallahassee talk radio host Preston Scott. Rubio, an author of the immigration proposal that passed the Senate this summer, said such a move could doom GOP immigration priorities of stepped-up border security and E-Verify checks in the Senate proposal. We cannot fact-check the future, but we thought it appropriate to examine whether Rubio’s worst-case scenario could actually happen. Could Obama essentially legalize "11 million people by the sign of a pen" like the DREAM Act population? No blanket citizenship It’s easy to interpret Rubio’s statement as Obama conceivably granting all-out citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order. That could not happen. Doing so would violate the country’s separation of powers. Congress determined the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. He does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. "Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time," said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. "Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act." But all-out citizenship is not exactly what Rubio warned against. Rubio is very familiar with this subject, having tried to craft a proposal similar to the DREAM Act, a law that would have provided legal residency to immigrants brought to the country by their parents. But in June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 430,000 people for this form of deferred action. An angry Rubio said Obama made it harder for any legislation to pass. To Rubio, Obama’s policy "basically legalized" this group of illegal immigrants and was improper -- and he’s not alone in this perspective. Giving someone a renewable status with work authorization and other benefits without punishment is de facto legalization, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that opposes the Senate bill and is for stricter immigration control. Others say deferred action does not amount to legal status because the classification is temporary. The action puts an individual in legal limbo while allowing them to possibly apply for a driver’s license and work without fear of immediate deportation, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a professor at the Pennsylvania State Dickinson School of Law and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights. The Department of Homeland Security justified the policy by saying it was within the "prosecutorial discretion" of the executive branch. Obama: ‘I’m not a king’ We’ve arrived at a significant part of our fact-check: Could Obama grant deferred action to the entire population of illegal immigrants, not just Dreamers? Obama has shot down that possibility, stressing the need for a comprehensive bill. "I’m not a king," Obama said in January to Telemundo. "You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law." Still, the administration has considered the pros and cons of a broad-based legalization program that excludes people who are a security risk, according to a leaked 2010 DHS memo. The draft memo detailed many risks for such a move, including blowback from Congress and the impression the department secretary is abdicating "her charge to enforce immigration laws." Rubio spokesman Alex Conant pointed us to a National Journal piece that examined an idea among immigration activists that involves persuading Obama "to freeze the current undocumented population in place through an administrative order, give them work permits, and hope for a better deal under the next president, with the hope that he or she is a Democrat," according to the story. They want Obama to expand the deferred action program to other immigrants here illegally, such as those who work, are caregivers, or are immigrant parents of children who are citizens. "It’s not an empty threat," Frank Sharry of America’s Voice told POLITICO. "If Republicans block reform with a path to citizenship, immigration reform activists will look at all their options, including broad executive action." Deferred action for all? Experts told us Obama indeed has broad executive power over deportations and granting temporary work permits. But it’s a stretch to say he could legally offer all undocumented immigrants that deal. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. "But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I’d consider pretty extreme circumstances," Delahunty said. On the other hand, the country’s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be "a crazy scenario," he said. Even some of Obama’s loudest critics on immigration policy don’t think he would go that far. "It could be done. Obama’s gotten away with as much, but I don’t think he’d do it," Krikorian said. "That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress." Experts thought it more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. "It would be the mother of all political battles," said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. "As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes." There’s also an argument that halting deportations alone would do little to offer relief to the country’s millions of unauthorized immigrants. They would still be in a legal limbo because most of the 400,000 or so people currently being deported are those who’ve committed crimes, said Lynden Melmed, who served as former chief counsel of the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the George W. Bush administration. Our ruling Rubio said that absent immigration reform from Congress, Obama "will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen." Could Obama offer deferred action for the entire population of undocumented immigrants? His executive powers over deportations are strong, but most experts say that’s an extreme scenario and susceptible to legal challenges, not to mention political fallout. More likely is that Obama could extend deferred action to more subsets of the undocumented population, pushing them lower on the priority list and into a deal-with-you-later category. That might be relief for them, but it’s also a legal limbo that falls short of legalization. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02200	Says Al Franken "voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in (the Affordable Care Act marketplaces)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/24/mike-mcfadden/gop-challenger-says-al-franken-voted-exempt-himsel/	Republican Mike McFadden claims his midterm opponent, incumbent Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., wanted to excuse himself from the health care reform’s requirement to buy insurance on the marketplace. "What’s Minnesota gotten from Al Franken?" the narrator asks in McFadden’s April 17 TV ad "Miss," a $9,800 buy. In the background, a hockey player misses each shot he takes. "Record spending, over 40 votes for higher taxes and Franken voted for Obamacare. Then voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in it. For Minnesota, it was miss after miss after miss." McFadden’s argument gets it wrong and hinges on a technicality. PolitiFact wanted to address the topic of a congressional exemption, one we’ve taken a look at already from other Republican lawmakers. How Congress gets its health plans Prior to the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress chose their plans from the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. They had an employer subsidy, similar to the one an average American usually gets from a large employer. But as the health care reform was drafted, Republicans wanted to make sure Democratic members of Congress would get a taste of their own medicine, so to speak. McFadden’s office pointed us to a 2009 amendment to the Affordable Care Act proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that called for members of Congress to buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces. Like most Democrats, Franken voted against that amendment. Around the same time, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., put forward a similar provision. The main difference was that Coburn’s didn’t indicate that legislators could put their employer-provided subsidies toward marketplace plans. Franken and other Democrats actually became sponsors on Coburn’s bill. When asked on the Senate floor if he was serious about purchasing insurance on the marketplace, Franken responded: "I talked to my wife, Franni. We have been married 34 years now. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said if this passed, we should do the public option. She said, 'Absolutely.' Yes, I am perfectly serious about this.'' The public option, envisioned as a government-backed insurance plan, didn’t make it into the final law. But Franken’s clear support of it shows he himself favored buying insurance under the new law. When Al Franken and 59 others voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, they approved the following text: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are— (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." In 2013, because Grassley’s exact wording hadn’t all been transferred to the law, there was confusion as to whether members of Congress would still receive their employer-provided subsidies when they switched plans. This is a special case, because most Americans who receive insurance from their employers were not affected by healthcare.gov’s launch. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management cleared things up in August 2013, a couple of months before the online marketplaces opened. They confirmed that legislators would be able to use their subsidies toward their marketplace premiums if they purchased through the District of Columbia’s marketplace. Franken purchased insurance using Minnesota’s state marketplace, MNsure, according to the Star Tribune. In doing so, he declined the employer subsidy the law allotted him and other legislators. Our ruling McFadden’s ad claimed Franken voted to exempt himself from enrolling in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The senator did vote against one amendment. However, he supported a different amendment that required Congress to buy marketplace insurance, and he clearly articulated his support for the idea on the Senate floor. Now he's buying his own insurance through the Minnesota exchange and voluntarily forgoing a subsidy. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10033	The stimulus bill includes "$8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a 'magnetic levitation' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/bobby-jindal/Jindal-on-high-speed-rail/	Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a moment in the national spotlight to claim the stimulus bill was "larded with wasteful spending," including money for what sounded like a theme-park ride. "It includes $300 million to buy new cars for the government, $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a 'magnetic levitation' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland, and $140 million for something called 'volcano monitoring,'" Jindal said of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, responding on national television to President Obama's first speech to Congress on Feb. 24, 2009. Critics questioned the premise that any of these was a waste of money, and some, including a few news organizations , suggested the high-speed rail claim was a well-worn lie. Republicans had been blasting the $8 billion expenditure — and playing fast and loose with the facts at times — ever since the House-Senate conference committee stuck it in the final version of the bill. Neither the House nor Senate versions had anything close to $8 billion for rail funding, and Republicans alleged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid added the money in conference specifically for a high-speed rail line from Anaheim, Calif., to Las Vegas, in Reid's home state. That proposed project would be powered by magnetic levitation, a technology in which opposing magnetic fields along the track and in the train's undercarriage levitate the train a quarter-inch and propel it forward. "Maglev" trains, currently in use in China and Japan, are frictionless and fast. Proponents say the proposed Anaheim-to-Vegas train would reach 310 mph, zipping passengers between the cities in 80.5 minutes. Reid has backed the project for years, and critics such as Rep. Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan and Sen. John McCain of Arizona alleged that's where all $8 billion was headed. That charge was widely, and appropriately, criticized as false. The money is not an "earmark." Nothing in the bill stipulates that it has to go to the Anaheim-to-Vegas project. In fact, it's all but certain dozens of other projects — such as in the Northeast corridor, where key Republican supporters of the stimulus bill reside, or in the Chicago area, hometown of another influential individual — will compete and win a share of the money. Now back to Jindal. It's not quite fair to lump his comment in with the prior claims. He was more careful than some of the other Republican critics. Though he may have left some listeners with the incorrect impression that the Vegas-Anaheim project would definitely get some or all of the money — and he may have done so intentionally — technicially he did not say that. He said it would go to projects "such as" Reid's project. Indeed, that project is an example of the sort that the $8 billion may fund, as proponents of it have pointed out repeatedly. "It would be great if this was one of those projects that would happen to benefit from it," Reid spokesman Jon Summers said in an interview. (He was vague about Reid's role in getting the $8 billion in the bill, saying "it was something that President Obama wanted and Senator Reid as a conferee supported.") Other boosters of the project also expressed optimism that they'll get some of the $8 billion. Anaheim-to-Vegas is not a federally designated high-speed rail corridor, but that doesn't mean it's out of the running. The Senate version of the bill, which had $2 billion for high speed rail, limited the money to such corridors, but the conference committee removed that requirement. That's not to say that Jindal's claim didn't have some problems. For one, the train would not stop at Disneyland. The plan is for it to stop 2 miles away at a proposed new transportation hub called the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center. Jindal may have said Disneyland rather than Anaheim to make the project sound recreational or frivolous — but in doing so he stretched the truth a tad. We also want to point out that although Jindal and just about everyone else who has talked about the $8 billion has said it's for high-speed rail, it's not just for high-speed rail. It's for high-speed rail and conventional "intercity" rail service. States and agencies all over the country can apply for a share of the money for all sorts of expenses related to city-to-city rail service, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. So Jindal was imprecise on a couple of counts — the train won't go to Disneyland and all $8 billion is not for high-speed rail. But he was not out of bounds in employing the Anaheim-to-Vegas train as an example of the sort of project that may be funded by the $8 billion. We find his claim Half True.

pomt-02286	"EPA officials have commended (Koch Industries) for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/charles-koch/epa-koch-brothers-business-environment/	For several weeks now, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has taken to the chamber floor to malign David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who contribute heavily to libertarian causes and bankroll ads critical of Democrats. On April 2, 2014, Charles Koch fired back in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, arguing that Reid’s comments were disrespectful and a bad sign for democracy. And he defended Koch Industries and their subsidiaries against attacks, including claims that they oppose environmental protections. "Koch employees have earned well over 700 awards for environmental, health and safety excellence since 2009, many of them from the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration," Koch wrote. "EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ " Subsidiaries of Koch Industries include manufacturers like paper maker Georgia Pacific and INVISTA, a textile fiber producer. It also owns companies that deal with excavation of natural resources like Flint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline. As you can imagine, these are industries that are heavily regulated by federal agencies like the EPA. So does the EPA think Koch Industries is a model environmentalist? We decided to explore that claim. Tracking down the quotes Quotes can often be taken out of context, so we thought it would be useful to understand exactly what the EPA said about Koch Industries and their subsidiaries. A spokesman for Koch Industries was able to provide a pair of press releases with the full quotes. So did the EPA call Koch Industries a "model for other companies"? Kinda, but not really. The EPA was complimentary of one specific agreement reached in 2010 with Koch subsidiary Flint Hills Resources after the agency raised concerns about permits for a refinery in Texas. "The process we have agreed to with Flint Hills Resources is an excellent one, and we look forward to working with the company to complete the work to transition their permits," stated Al Armendariz, Regional Administrator for EPA Region 6. "It is our hope that the FHR process will serve as a model for other companies seeking to transition to federally-approved permits." As you can see, they were very complimentary of the process in this one instance for this refinery in Texas. But it wasn’t really a blanket statement of the company or Koch Industries. Let’s move on to whether the EPA has commended Koch Industries for their "commitment to a cleaner environment." This one has more truth to it, but again, in a limited context. In 2009, Georgia Pacific was named a SmartWay Excellence Award recipient by the EPA. SmartWay is a private-public program run by the EPA that links up manufacturers and retailers with transportation services to "improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance ... of the goods movement supply chains." Georgia Pacific was given the award because the company increased its partnership with SmartWay-approved carriers and grew more efficient in their distribution models. According to a Georgia Pacific press release, here’s the full quote from the EPA official: "I commend Georgia-Pacific for its leadership in promoting sustainable transportation practices through the SmartWay Transport Partnership," said Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA. "These actions demonstrate a commitment to a cleaner environment and more secure energy supply." An EPA spokeswoman told PolitiFact that the statement was solely "about GP’s transportation practices as a member of SmartWay," and not an assessment of the entire company. Interestingly, the EPA used identical language in 2000 after reaching a clean air agreement with Koch Petroleum Group and BP Amoco. But the accord was only finalized after Koch was forced to pay a $4.5 million penalty and spend $80 million to improve emissions in three refineries. "BP Amoco and Koch took the initiative to begin talks with EPA earlier this spring rather than wait for possible EPA enforcement action," the EPA said in a press release. "In return for the company’s cooperation and ambitious commitment to a cleaner environment, EPA has offered a ‘clean slate’ for certain past violations, and greater flexibility and incentives for new technology." So in this case, "commitment to a cleaner environment" only came after the EPA threatened enforcement actions. What else has EPA said about Koch Industries? While those positive quotes about Koch Industries and their subsidies are at least partially accurate, it’s a lopsided picture of the EPA’s dealings with the company in the last two decades. Since the late 1990s, Koch companies have repeatedly found themselves in the crosshairs of the EPA for various environmental violations. On numerous occasions they were forced to pay hefty fines and settlements and change their practices as a result of EPA and Justice Department action. The bulk of the more serious violations occurred years ago, but there have been other actions taken recently as well. Here’s a sampling: In 1999, Koch Industries was found guilty of negligence and malice after two teens in Texas died as a result of an underground pipe leaking butane, according to reports. In January 2000, Koch Industries was forced to pay a $30 million civil penalty, "the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law" and $5 million in cleanup efforts to resolve claims of more than 300 spills from oil pipelines in six states. "This record civil penalty sends a clear message to those who transport hazardous materials: You cannot endanger public health or the environment," said Attorney General Janet Reno. "We will not let you foul our water and spoil our land by breaking the law." In March 2000, the Koch Petroleum Group was sentenced to pay $6 million in criminal fines and $2 million in remediation costs — the largest federal fine ever paid in Minnesota at the time — after it was found that one of their refineries polluted waterways and wetlands in Minnesota before 1997. According to a press release, "Koch admitted that it negligently discharged aviation fuel into a wetland and an adjoining waterway. Even though Koch was aware of the problem, it did not develop a comprehensive plan to recover between 200,000-600,000 gallons of released fuel until June 1997." In September 2000, Koch Industries was indicted for environmental crimes at a refinery the company owned in Texas. They eventually paid a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to one criminal charge. "Companies that produce dangerous pollutants simply cannot focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of a community's health," said Lois Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the environment at the Justice Department. "We will continue to find and prosecute those who would flout our environmental laws." In February 2013, Koch Nitrogen Company paid a $380,000 fine for failing to create a risk management program for facilities producing and storing ammonia products in Iowa and Kansas. In March 2014, Flint Hills Resources paid a $350,000 fine for leaky equipment at a Texas chemical plant that allowed hazardous air pollutants into the atmosphere. Though the EPA also credited the company for implementing what it described as "innovative technologies" in the plant to capture pollutants. Our ruling In his op-ed, Charles Koch wrote that "EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ " Actually, the EPA was focusing on very limited aspects of Koch Industries and not the company as a whole. Further, Koch Industries has a history with the EPA that was completely glossed over, and it includes multiple violations of rules. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11479	"Electrolux, Sweden's largest appliance maker, has just abandoned a $250 million investment in the United States because of the steel tariffs. That is retaliation."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/05/stuart-varney/fox-business-host-makes-2-errors-steel-tariffs-and/	A fair bit of uncertainty surrounds President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Trump said he wanted a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but the White House gave no additional details, such as whether any countries might be exempted. It’s also unclear how other countries might respond. Fox Business host Stuart Varney discussed the potential for retaliation, saying American producers of corn or beef might see new tariffs imposed overseas for their products. That all remained to be seen, but Varney ended with one immediate example he had just learned about. "Electrolux, Sweden's largest appliance maker, has just abandoned a $250 million investment in the United States because of the steel tariffs," Varney said. "That is retaliation." We looked at two questions: Did Electrolux cancel plans to expand its plant in Springfield, Tenn.? And does its decision amount to retaliation? Electrolux said Varney got it wrong. It hasn’t canceled anything. "It’s not accurate to say that we have abandoned the investment," said Daniel Frykholm, the top spokesman for Electrolux. "We are concerned about the negative impact, financially and on the overall competitiveness of our U.S. operations. Until we have the final order and can understand the details, we are putting our commitment to invest $250 million in Tennessee on hold." Electrolux buys only American steel for the Frigidaire-brand refrigerators, dishwashers and other home appliances it makes in the United States. The trade experts we reached said they wouldn’t call Electrolux’s move retaliation precisely because its operations are exposed to changes in the price of steel. "If steel in the United States is now much more expensive because of Trump’s national security tariffs, then it would be cheaper to make the appliances in another country," said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade Washington think tank. "That is a business decision, not retaliation." Frederick Abbott, law professor at the Florida State University College of Law, said legally, Electrolux’s announcement doesn’t fit the definition of retaliation. Exactly as Varney was saying before he mentioned Electrolux, nations retaliate, not companies. "Action by a privately owned company would not be considered ‘retaliation’, which would generally be understood to refer to a governmental measure, such as the imposition of tariffs or quotas," Abbott said. The only gray zone in trade law, Abbott said, is in the case of state-owned industry, for example in China. But Electrolux is owned by a broad range of investors, including American retirement funds such as Vanguard and TIAA, and many others. Electrolux doesn’t fall into any gray zone, Abbott said. "The decision by Electrolux would not be considered retaliation by knowledgeable trade lawyers and economists," Abbott said. We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back. Our ruling Varney said that Electrolux had abandoned a $250 million investment in an American plant in "retaliation" for steel tariffs announced by Trump. The statement errs on two points. Electrolux said it had put its plans on hold until it better understood the impact on the price of steel, a key input in the home appliances it makes. Trade experts said that pause is a business decision, not retaliation. In trade, retaliation is the province of governments that might choose to slap their own tariffs on another country’s goods to get even for new tariffs their companies face. Electrolux did put its investment on hold, but beyond that basic fact, Varney was off the mark. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12952	In New York, "Average college debt - $30,000 per student."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/05/andrew-cuomo/college-graduates-new-york-owe-about-30000-average/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said high levels of student loan debt motivated his proposal for free tuition at any public university or community college in New York state for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. "It is incredibly expensive, and the debt is so high it’s like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg," Cuomo said of paying for college. "Average college debt -- $30,000 per student." The governor’s office projected 210,000 students would seek the benefit. If so, the program would cost the state $163 million annually by 2019. So is Cuomo right about the average student debt load in New York state? The average debt load The Federal Reserve Bank of New York collected 2015 data on student loan debt in the state. The Fed reports 17.9 percent of consumers in New York state have a student loan, and their average college debt is $32,200. That’s higher than the national average of $29,700, the Fed said. The debt steadily increased for a decade. According to a September report from the State Comptroller’s office, the average student debt load in New York State increased by more than 47 percent between 2005 and 2015. The national average grew by 56 percent. Total student debt statewide more than doubled during that time period. The Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, non-profit organization, pegged the average debt of the state’s college graduates in 2015 at $29,320. That ranked 18th highest among the states. Fifty-nine percent of the students graduated with debt, the organization said. The average debt among graduates of State University of New York campuses was generally lower than their private college counterparts. The average debt for University at Buffalo graduates was $26,165, followed by those at Binghamton University, $25,844; SUNY Albany, $25,727; and Stony Brook University, $23,542. The average debt for graduates fluctuated among private colleges in New York state. Among the higher averages were incurred by graduates of Ithaca College, $39,771; Rochester Institute of Technology, $38,198; St. Bonaventure University, $38,073; Fordham University, $37,607; and Syracuse University, $36,500, according to the institute. The average debt was lower - but still significant - for graduates at other private universities: Colgate University, $20,859; Cornell University, $24,394; Clarkson University, $29,000; New York University, $30,480; St. John’s University, $33,179. Our ruling Cuomo said the average college debt for those who borrowed for college in New York state is "$30,000 per student." Cuomo gets it right, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, which analyzed debt for 2015 graduates in New York State. And his claim is about what the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculates for all New York state consumers with college debt.

pomt-07496	There was "some sort of informal commitment to build a (psychiatric) building in downtown Cleveland."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/12/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-there-was-informal-agreement-/	Gov. John Kasich announced in his State of the State address his decision to not build a psychiatric hospital on Euclid Avenue in the Midtown area of Cleveland. The Ohio Department of Mental Health, he said, would scrap "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland," and instead would renovate Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's "dilapidated" facility in Northfield. Kasich said he broke the news to Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson in a phone call and that Jackson responded that he understood. The result, Kasich said, will be reduced operating expenses, money saved on capital improvements and better care for the mentally ill. Jackson subsequently said he did not acquiesce as Kasich implied. Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman, said Jackson told Kasich he understood the rationale but that he didn’t agree with the decision. Other local officials argue that the project was not intended as a building development for Cleveland but as a service for patients and their families, most of whom are from Cuyahoga County. PolitiFact Ohio is not weighing the merits of the two sites and plans. This item will just consider Kasich's statement about "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland." We asked the governor's office for supporting details, and got them from Trudy Sharp, communications director for the Department of Mental Health. The mayor's office connected us with Chris Warren, Jackson's chief of regional development. Both sides -- if they can be called sides -- gave essentially the same accounting of events: As far back as 2003, the state began looking to replace Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's facility on West 25th Street in Cleveland. By 2007, the plan expanded to include replacement of the Northfield facility on a single site in Cuyahoga County. In 2008, without designating a site, the General Assembly budgeted $83.7 million "to replace the Cleveland facility, with consideration for expansion that will allow for the merger of the Cleveland and Northfield facilities." After considering at least 10 sites, the city and state signed a letter of intent in June 2009 to use property on Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue in the Midtown Corridor, with various conditions. Both had the right to end the agreement without penalty. To meet conditions, Warren said, the city spent $4 million assembling and preparing the 14-acre site. The state would have paid the city $2.1 million for it. Sharp said the letter expired at the end of 2009, and the city did not extend it. Warren said the letter did not expire but would have had to be actively terminated. He noted that correspondence and meetings between the city and state continued through 2010, and that the city's work on the hospital site continued. Warren and Taylor said the city learned of Kasich's decision to instead renovate the Northfield facility, without a chance for discussion, 48 hours before it was announced. "Legally they're within their rights," Warren said. He said the city had accepted a risk in acquiring and preparing the property, which now is "very marketable." But developing the property "is not what it (the agreement) was to do," he said. "It was to provide mental health services, to keep services in Cleveland. That was the intent of the appropriation." Of the $83.7 million allocated for construction, $60 million will go to renovation in Northfield, Sharp said. The rest will go to other facilities around the state. She said the department would save money because the projected cost of a new facility in Cleveland had climbed to $100 million. Where does that leave us? It is true that a letter of intent is not a binding, irrevocable agreement. But the letter of intent is also more than just a wink and a nod. A letter of intent is an understanding that often is preliminary to a formal contract. A story March 19 in The Plain Dealer bought into Kasich’s terminology, describing site work Cleveland did as "part of an informal agreement with the state." But is that what an average person would think knowing all the details? Characterizing the arrangement as "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland" suggests vagueness about the plans. That’s not the case. People in Cleveland and Columbus worked for years on this project. We think a listener hearing Kasich's description would be surprised by these details: The evaluation of facilities dated back eight years The General Assembly included $83.7 million in its 2008 budget for a new clinic to replace the antiquated facility in Cleveland The city did lengthy work on site search, acquisition and preparation and a price had been determined for how much the state would pay the city for the property. The city and state put their intentions to use the Midtown site in writing. Given those details, we think characterizing the effort as some sort of an informal commitment is not just misleading, but also inaccurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as False.

pomt-07185	"We've seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/09/brian-deese/economics-adviser-brian-deese-says-auto-industry-h/	As President Barack Obama prepared to go to Toledo on June 3 to laud the American auto industry’s comeback, the White House as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown were prepping the press. Brian Deese, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, joined Brown, an Ohio Democrat, June 2 on a telephone news conference call to hail the industry’s resurgence following Chrysler’s and General Motors’ bankruptcies and $62 billion worth of government bailouts. "We've seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy," said Deese, a point man on the auto recovery for the Obama administration. "More than 8,000 jobs in Ohio," he continued. "That's the best case of job growth in this country since the late '90s in the auto industry." These numbers made us pause, because of something The Plain Dealer had published that very day: The two automakers employ 16,500 fewer people nationwide than they did in 2009. Just looking at Ohio plants, Chrysler downsized its workforce since 2009 while General Motors had an increase. Put together, these resulted in a net gain of 1,496 jobs in the state. These numbers are very different from what the administration cited. How could that be? Deese said it’s because he was talking about the overall industry -- U.S. workers at Chrysler and General Motors and also at every other company in the industry. That includes auto parts makers and people employed in car dealerships and parts stores, because parts makers often supply multiple manufacturers and each component of the industry relies on the other. Deese said his numbers came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the White House provided us with the data.. We also went to BLS’ databases independently. Deese’s numbers checked out, both nationally and for Ohio, but his starting point left us with some questions. We found that from June 2009 to April 2011, the most recent month reported, the auto industry rebounded with 115,400 jobs nationwide and 8,200 in Ohio. These were the months Deese used for his measurement.. Why June? Because that’s when Chrysler’s strongest operations emerged from bankruptcy with a new life -- on June 10 -- after filing in April that year. But General Motors didn’t file for bankruptcy until June 1, 2009, and the bankruptcy didn’t end until July 10. What would the rebound look like, then, if we didn’t start counting until July? By waiting to count until the month GM exited bankruptcy, the industry’s nationwide comeback would come to 84,300 jobs, which would put Deese’s claim off by 27 percent nationally. In Ohio, however, he’d still be awfully close, at 7,900. We bring this up not to nit-pick. Calculations for both time frames show a rebound. But Deese specifically said his numbers showed the success "since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy," and "emerge" means to rise from. GM was still engaged in its reorganization when the turnaround started. The dates Deese chose also happen to show the greatest level of rebound. Would it have been more accurate for him to start his counting a month later, when GM exited bankruptcy? We asked the Center for Automotive Research, in Ann Arbor, Mich., which analyzes the auto industry and studies its employment trends closely. We also asked Susan Helper, chair of economics at Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management. Both of these sources looked at the BLS data, too. Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research labor and research group, told us she thought it was fair for the White House to pick June, even though General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July. "June is the low point," she said, and that’s a good point to start when measuring a comeback. Plant closings and layoffs had spread for months before then, and by June the government was involved heavily in GM’s restructuring. In the three months before June 2009, the number of workers in auto plants had dropped by 20,300, according to the BLS. "I think it’s a fair assessment," Dziczek said of Deese’s statement. Helper, of CWRU, agreed, noting that while Chrysler’s bankruptcy and the government’s role were surrounded by questions about the legality and propriety of such intervention, the GM bankruptcy was swift and it was apparent from the filing in June that the company would emerge quickly. And, she asserted, the phrase "since emerging from bankruptcy" could be interpreted to include not only these government-aided bankruptcies but also the start of the Cash for Clunkers auto buyback program that Congress passed in June 2009; White House economic policies at the time that were aimed at the broader U.S. economy, and general economic conditions that threatened everything from jobs to car sales. Considering the economic risks at the time, she said, "conceivably you could argue that the 115,000 figure is an under-estimate" when measuring the success. Before we give Deese’s claim a rating, we’ll note two last things. First, a day after Deese spoke, BLS updated its data, giving figures for May, 2011. Doing a calculation with these figures, we found that had Deese waited a day, he would have had to say 113,200 instead of 115,000. This difference is so minor, but we include it for the sake of accuracy -- and to note that the White House, too, was aware of this slight change. By the time Obama spoke in Toledo that day, he said, "So far the auto industry has added 113,000 jobs over the past two years." Second, some critics still say the administration overstepped its bounds with the bailouts. Taxpayers are expected to lose $14 billion in the end. That’s less than the $48 billion loss that was projected earlier, and much less than it would have cost in pension bailouts and other economy-wide expenses had the automakers failed. But skeptics say the free market -- and outside companies -- might have picked up the pieces without the government needing to intervene. We’ll never know, although Dziczek and Helper say the bailouts helped avoid economic catastrophe. So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter. Deese was correct if we measure his statement against job figures for June 2009, when Chrysler left bankruptcy. But General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July 2009, and that produces a lower number. The Center for Automotive Research’s Dzieczek says it was nevertheless reasonable to start counting at that date, and so does CRWU’s economics chair, Helper. The Obama administration was heavily involved by then, they said, and it’s fair for it to claim all those job gains. But while the June date may be a reasonable starting point for Deese to have chosen, PolitiFact also is guided by the principles of the Truth-O-Meter. A key one is that words matter. We pay close attention to the specific wording of a claim. So we go back to Deese’s words: "since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy." GM had not yet climbed out of bankruptcy when Deese starts his count. And that’s important to know because had he started after GM emerged from bankruptcy, the figure for total number of jobs created would have been more than 30,000 fewer. So Deese’s notion is accurate -- but a listener needs that important detail for a full understanding of his claim. That is exactly how the Truth-O-Meter defines Half True.

pomt-07725	"We’re broke. We don’t have any more money."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke/	Republicans from Washington to Madison have adopted a new expression when it comes to describing the state of government finances: "We’re broke." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker started using the "broke" description as he unveiled his controversial budget-repair bill, which would force state employees to pay more for health care and pensions and curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees. "I don't have anything to negotiate," Walker said Feb. 11, 2011, the day he unveiled his budget-repair bill, aimed at closing a $137 million gap in the budget that ends June 30, 2011. "We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years." Since then, he’s repeated the phrase many times. "The bottom line is we are trying to balance our budget and there really is no room to negotiate on that because we’re broke," Walker said Feb. 21, 2011 on ABC’s "Good Morning America." " At a news conference that day, he said: "We’re broke. We don’t have any more money." He added: "We have a $3.6 billion budget deficit (for the next two years). You can’t really negotiate if you don’t have any money to negotiate with." In his March 1, 2011 budget speech, the governor said: "The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it’s time to start paying our bills today – so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow." Walker, of course, has promised not to turn to one conventional tool the state has available to make ends meet -- raising taxes. That’s a political decision and one we are not focused on in this item. Rather, we’re focusing on the language Walker and supporters are using to describe the state’s finances and to persuade taxpayers that his solutions are best. Since the "broke" description has become so common, we decided to look at exactly what it means and whether it is an accurate description of Wisconsin’s financial state. Let’s start with some dictionary definitions: Broke: having no money; bankrupt. Broke: without money; penniless. Broke: Synonyms: bankrupt, beggared, bust, cleaned out, destitute, dirt poor, flat broke , impoverished, in Chapter 11, in debt, indebted, indigent, insolvent, needy, penniless, penurious, poor, ruined, stone broke, strapped, tapped out. We’ll add a more conversational use: "I’m broke. Can you buy this round of beers?" Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patients Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision said former Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration illegally tapped into the fund. Werwie also cited the "Medicaid deficit", the "corrections deficit" and "other things out there." The state, he said, has been running "massive structural deficits for years." in earlier items, we found the deficit in the budget ending June 30, 2011, is real and rated False a claim that the $3.6 billion deficit projected for the next two fiscal years is a "bogus" number. Walker wants to close the current deficit with a combination of debt restructuring and changes that would affect most public employees -- including limiting collective bargaining rights to only wages, and then only within limits. The outcry over that provision stirred the huge protests in Madison, the walkout by Democrats in the state Senate, and numerous efforts by Walker and Republicans to explain their position. The Republican explanation has been that Walker’s "budget-repair bill" includes modest requests of state employees and brings their benefit contributions in line with private sector workers. And it’s continued: The state has no choice....because we’re broke. To be sure, some local governments have gone belly up, but not many. The Wall Street Journal’s David Wessel reported in fall of 2010 that fewer than 250 of the nation’s 89,000 government units have filed for bankruptcy since 1980. "Recent close calls in Harrisburg, Pa., and Central Falls, R.I., spark predictions that the next phase of the financial crisis will be a tsunami of municipal bankruptcies and defaults," Wessel wrote. "Muni-bond experts at rating agencies and bankruptcy lawyers assure us that isn't likely." He added: "After Vallejo, Calif., won a federal judge's OK to use Chapter 9 in 2008 to extricate itself from union contracts, there were widespread predictions that other cities would follow. ‘Two and a half years later that hasn't been the case,’ says Robert Kurtter, who oversees state and local government ratings at Moody's Investors Service." In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kurtter said few municipalities have filed for bankruptcy because it’s a long, complicated and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. In addition, states are prohibited from filing bankruptcy under federal law. A columnist for Governing magazine addressed the issue in fall of 2010. "There may be talk about governments being bankrupt and insolvent when what is meant is, ‘We don't want to raise taxes and don't want to spend so we have to cut.’" Penelope Lemov wrote in the article. Meanwhile, in January 2011, Moody’s issued a national report that combined state debt and pension liabilities. Moody’s studies and rates debt issued by governments and corporations, and its ratings can affect how much those issuing bonds will have to pay in interest. The report says that combining those obligations makes it easier to compare the fiscal health of states. Those with the highest ratings have the most serious debt burdens, which makes them less appealing to investors. Wisconsin’s rating was 37th as measured by the amount of debt per capita, 38th (debt by GDP) 39 (by personal income) and 41 (by revenue). "States’ liability rankings versus revenue or economic measures tend to be indicative of the nature of risks these states carry in funding their obligations over the long term," the report says. So according to the Moody’s debt ranking, Wisconsin fares well when compared with other states. That’s one measure of the state’s fiscal health. We asked a few local experts about the use of the term "broke" to describe the state of Madison’s finances: Andrew Reschovsky, a UW-Madison professor of public affairs and finance, said use of the term didn’t make sense when it comes to the state’s financial situation. "That’s obviously absurd," Reschovsky said. "We obviously aren’t broke. The analogy to a household is really a fallacious one." He said the government has powerful tools at its disposal to make ends meet: taxes or manipulating fees. You could also put off some spending or shift some debt into the next fiscal year -- tricks that state budget offices have routinely used. Walker has taken tax increases off of the table. He proposed in his budget-repair bill to restructure the state’s debt, pushing some payments off into the future. "For the amount of money that we’re talking about there’s a wide range of things that could be done," Reschovsky said. The $137 million deficit in the budget year ending June 30 represents about 0.456 percent of the $30 billion state budget, or less than half of 1 percent. The projected $3.6 billion deficit for the next two-year budget is more serious: about 12 percent of the overall budget. Connie Kilmark, owner of a Madison firm that consults people in financial trouble, said of Walker’s "broke" rhetoric: "It’s just not true. He’s trying to scare us all." The state has taxing power, and revenue is continuing to flow in -- both key factors in making ends meet, she said. As the economic recovery continues, tax revenue is expected to actually rise $1.5 billion in the next two-year period, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Claire Ann Resop, a Madison attorney who handles bankruptcies and reviews other bankruptcy cases filed in that part of the state, said "broke" is measured by whether or not you can pay your bills. Said Resop: "I haven’t heard that they’ve been defaulting." That said, some of the bills are due. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, for instance, has expressed impatience with Wisconsin’s delays on repayment, saying in January that Wisconsin should pay up immediately. Ken King, of the Family Service Association in Sheboygan, which runs a consumer credit counseling center, said, "When you have nothing to draw on anymore, you’re broke." Ralph Anzivino, a Marquette University Law School professor who teaches bankruptcy law, said, "Broke is a lay term, a street term." He said it would be more accurate to say that the state was insolvent but has options at its disposal to put its house in order. They include: raising taxes, laying off workers and cutting costs or finding other savings. Then there is this perspective from within state government itself. "The state is no more broke than it was two, four or 10 years ago," said Frank Hoadley, capital finance director with the state Department of Administration. "There’s always a huge gap" as budget deliberations begin, he said. "And it always gets hammered out." In unveiling his two-year budget, Walker cut aid to local schools and government by about $1 billion. But the proposal, which now goes to the Legislature, included new spending in some areas, including adding $1 million in raises for prosecutors, $993,800 for additional public defenders and $1.04 million to investigate Internet crimes against children. On the opposite side of the ledger, the budget reduced revenue by some $140 million through a variety of tax cuts, including ones aimed at businesses and individuals with Health Savings Accounts. Finally, we took the question to Wall Street and the experts at Moody’s, who are hired by the state to study and rate its debt. A Moody’s panel, including Kurtter, one of the most respected municipal finance experts in the country, discussed Wisconsin’s dilemma and Walker’s assertion and made these observations: The state’s debt has a very high credit rating of AA2 and that has not changed in years. That compares favorably with other states, including Illinois, that face far more severe budget crunches. Wisconsin is in the same boat as numerous other states face unprecedented economic pressures due to the effects of the recession, said Kurtter, who added that budget pressures will continue to mount. "This is not a problem that’s isolated in Wisconsin," said Kimberly Lyons, a Moody’s analyst. Kurtter noted that Wisconsin faces unique challenges because the state does not have a reserve or "rainy day" fund. The state’s "budget stabilization fund" had an average balance of $1.685 million in January, according to Robert Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That supports a budget that has a $14 billion in general fund spending. Kurtter said Wall Street will look at several factors when deciding how much risk Wisconsin presents to future investors. They include: whether or not a budget is adopted, whether it closes the shortfall, and whether it does it in a "structural way," that is long-term. So, let’s review. Walker and other Republicans say the state is broke, so broke that there’s no money, and because there’s no money, they are unwilling to negotiate over the terms of the budget-repair bill. Experts agree the state faces financial challenges in the form of deficits. But they also agree the state isn’t broke. Employees and bills are being paid. Services are continuing to be performed. Revenue continues to roll in. A variety of tools -- taxes, layoffs, spending cuts, debt shifting -- is available to make ends meet. Walker has promised not to increase taxes. That takes one tool off the table. Another tool was never there: declaring bankruptcy. We’re not broke or bankrupt in part because under federal law we can’t be. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-10537	"I want to freeze interest rates for five years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/26/hillary-clinton/clinton-at-times-forgets-major-caveats/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has a detailed plan to deal with the foreclosure crisis in the housing market — so detailed that she sometimes leaves out crucial caveats when she explains it. Most of Clinton's plan centers on subprime loans. A subprime loan is a home loan at a higher-than-normal interest rate to a borrower who is perceived to be a higher credit risk. It is typically issued to homeowners with poor credit, and sometimes to investors who are taking on higher-than-normal debt loads. Clinton's plan has several elements: She wants lenders to freeze foreclosures for 90 days on owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages. She wants lenders to freeze interest rates on subprime loans for owner-occupied homes for five years, or until homeowners can refinance. She wants to create a $30-billion fund for states to deal with the effects of foreclosures, everything from helping individual homeowners pay their bills to making up lost property tax revenues for police and firefighters. Clinton believes lenders should voluntarily embrace the freezes she suggests as a means of preventing widespread defaults. She would not impose the freezes through the force of law. Got all that? It's a detailed policy, and she has criticized Obama for having a less substantive position. Obama does not advocate the freezes Clinton suggests, but offers a similar fund for states and reforms for the lending process designed to increase transparency for home buyers. The problem Clinton is running into on the campaign trail is that she regularly shorthands her terminology, giving the impression that her plan is broader than it is. Instead of saying she wants to freeze interest rates for subprime loans on owner-occupied homes, she has said only that she wants to freeze interest rates. Anyone with an adjustable rate mortgage might think her plan applies to them, when it doesn't. For example, at a debate on Jan. 31, 2008, in California, Clinton said: "I think it's imperative that we approach this mortgage crisis with the seriousness that it is presenting. There are 95,000 homes in foreclosure in California right now. I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes, and I want to freeze interest rates for five years." Well, lots of homeowners have adjustable rate mortgages, and not all of them are subprime borrowers. Nowhere did Clinton mention that the freezes only apply to owner-occupied homes bought with subprime loans. Some of her direct-mail pieces also elide these caveats; check out examinations from Factcheck.org here and from the Atlantic Monthly here . That vagueness has prompted criticism. Two economists wrote in the New Republic recently that they weren't clear what Clinton was proposing, and that some of her language suggested an interest rate freeze for every adjustable rate mortgage in the country. Such a widespread change to the mortgage industry would be foolhardy, argued economists Richard Thaler and Susan Woodward. "Promising the American people that you can fix things by just lowering their interest rates is dishonest, a fairy tale that won't come true," they wrote. Economist Laura Tyson, who served as Bill Clinton's national economic adviser, responded in defense of Clinton's plan, reiterating its details and saying that Thaler and Woodward distorted Clinton's proposal to make points. "Her recommendations deserve serious discussion, not unsubstantiated attacks by scholars who should read her words more carefully than they apparently have," Tyson said. Thaler and Woodward wrote again, saying that Clinton was the one who needed to be more careful in her public remarks. They also said that Clinton has offered a frustrating lack of specifics on how she would implement a largely voluntary plan. We agree with Thaler and Woodward that Clinton has omitted details of her plan, most notably at the California debate. Yes, it is easier to say "freeze interest rates" than "freeze interest rates in owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages." But that doesn't mean the short version is accurate. We find her overly broad synopsis of her plan to be Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-26T00:00:00	2008-01-31	['None']
pomt-00940	"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’"	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/23/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-22-times-barack-obama-said-he-cou/	After a federal judge in Texas ruled against President Barack Obama’s actions potentially shielding thousands of unauthorized residents from deportation, the Texan who led the court challenge described Obama as a key helper for the states challenging the Democratic president’s authority. Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who in 2014 launched the legal challenge joined by more than 20 other states when he was still the attorney general of Texas, told Sean Hannity of Fox News: "I think we will win all the way for one simple reason, and that is: The man you just had on the screen, Barack Obama, is our star witness." Abbott added in the Feb. 17, 2015, interview: "22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’ Those words alone show that he violated the Constitution and violated federal law." We learned of Abbott’s quotation of Obama and his "22 times" count from a Breitbart.com news story, which also noted the president’s exact wording had previously been, "I just took an action to change the law," and that Obama made that comment five days after the adminstration’s action was announced, not the next day. We looked into Abbott’s count of 22 and his quotation, ultimately finding his statement close to completely so. But we started by revisiting recent history. Obama and Abbott announcements In November 2014, Obama declared the administration’s plans to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions, telling the American people: "If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes — you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law." Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a "deferred action" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. Fast-forward to Dec. 3, 2014; that’s when Abbott announced Texas and other states were challenging the latest Obama move in federal court. And what the state filed that day included a version of the Obama quotation we’re looking into: "What you’re not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law." Speaking to reporters, Abbott commented: "The president’s job is to execute the laws, not de facto make law by suspending parts of laws that are passed by Congress." We asked Abbott to elaborate on his claim to Fox News and didn’t hear back. But we recognized he’d echoed another Texan’s criticism. In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, drew a Mostly True from us after saying Obama had previously "said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority" to act as he did on immigration. McCaul had relied on a list of Obama quotations posted online by House Speaker John Boehner, which we found partly flawed, making McCaul’s count too high. In the end, still, we confirmed nearly 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 of Obama saying he couldn’t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action. White House response Asked about McCaul's claim at the time, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded by email, pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. It’s a challenge to characterize the president’s remarks. For instance, Abbott’s legal filing included Obama’s Sept. 28, 2011, response to a law student’s request that he do his part to enable students who immigrated to the U.S. with their parents to become legal residents. As noted in the legal filing, Obama replied: "I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce." The legal filing ends the quotation there, yet Obama continued talking and said he retained enforcement discretion. "Now, what we can do is to prioritize enforcement," the president said, "since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we’re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who’s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status," if laws were changed. We counted 15 Obama quotations--not 22--in the Texas-led legal filing supportive of Abbott’s point, with nearly all of them previously tick-tocked in our check of McCaul. For more analysis of relevant details, see our rundown here. Did Obama say he personally ‘changed the law?’ Next, we searched the White House website and isolated what Obama said in a Chicago speech Nov. 25, 2014 after at least one audience member interrupted his remarks to urge a complete end to deportations. Here’s what Obama replied, according to the government transcript: "I've heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right? Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law. (Applause.) So that's point, number one." Obama went on: "Point number two, the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody." Our ruling Abbott said that 22 times, Obama "said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’" Like McCaul, Abbott overstates the number of confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn’t independently do more to prevent deportations. He also left out some of what Obama said about changing the law and was slightly off on the president’s timing. With these clarifications, though, Abbott’s statement is spot-on. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02031	"Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/04/rick-scott/charlie-crist-allowed-college-tuition-increase-15-/	Education spending is a weapon of choice for both sides of the battle lines in this year’s Florida gubernatorial election. This time around, Gov. Rick Scott is again lobbing an incendiary charge at his presumptive Democratic challenger. "Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year," Scott’s political committee Let’s Get to Work said in a statewide campaign ad, which launched June 2, 2014. It then goes on to say Scott repealed the increase. This attack is worded a bit differently from a claim we checked a couple months ago and found Mostly False. Let’s check the report card on this one again. Calculating costs Scott for Florida told us the commercial refers to the 2009 plan to set tuition rates for Florida universities. Before Crist took office in 2007, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. The university system’s Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, capped at 15 percent. That system changed later that year, when the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, and vetoed a 5 percent increase set by lawmakers. He reversed himself later that year, and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature’s increase was 6 percent in 2008, with the state’s five largest universities getting additional tuition bumps. Crist signed that year’s budget without challenging the changes. But in 2009, the Legislature approved a new plan that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved. As long as the total increase didn’t exceed 15 percent per year, they were allowed to do this until tuition reached the national average, which was $8,893 in 2012-13. Crist advocated for this plan, and signed off on it when the Legislature approved it. That’s the basis of the ad’s attack. At the time, universities argued the system needed to raise tuition to pay for scholarships, keep top professors and compete with other states. (Florida was 45th in tuition costs in 2011, and 43rd by 2013.) The need only increased after the Legislature starting slashing post-secondary education funding following the Great Recession, some university officials argued. How did the process work? Stick with us here. It’s a little complicated, because under tuition differential rules, both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition. The Legislature set its base tuition increase each year (it would go up by the rate of inflation if no budget action was taken). Then individual universities would ask the Board of Governors for another increase, called tuition differential. Those two numbers, the base increase and the differential, couldn’t add up to more than 15 percent. It can be less, but has been 15 percent a few times -- notably when both Crist and Scott were governor. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase, but not the Board of Governors increase. He appoints the Board’s members, but has no official say in their decisions. Here’s how the tuition increases played out under both Crist and Scott: Year (Governor in office) Legislative increase Board of Governors increase Total 2007 (Crist) 5 percent N/A 5 percent 2008 (Crist) 6 percent N/A 6 percent 2009 (Crist)* 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2010 (Crist) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2011 (Scott) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2012 (Scott) 0 percent Varied by university Varied by university 2013 (Scott) 3 percent (vetoed) 0 percent 1.7 percent (indexed to inflation) * Tuition differential law takes effect Scott definitely used his veto power to stop the Legislature in 2013, but it was his influence on the Board of Governors that kept last year’s hike so low. The governor may not be able to veto the board, but he certainly can express an opinion to its members, which he did. Now that we’ve gone through all this for purposes of fact-checking the ad, you can forget about it for future tuition increases: The entire tuition differential process was scrapped by the Legislature during the 2014 session as part of a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition. Now automatic tuition increases are gone, even for inflation; the Legislature can vote for one, and only the University of Florida and Florida State can lobby the Board for a differential increase, up to a maximum of 6 percent. Our ruling Scott for Florida’s new ad about education costs said, "Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year." Tuition did go up 15 percent in 2009 and 2010. But the ad downplays the fact that tuition increased 5 and 6 percent the two years prior to that. (It also neglects to mention it went up 15 percent under Gov. Scott one year, as well.) We should also note that Crist wasn’t the only actor here. The Legislature approved increases, as did the state Board of Governors. Still, tuition did go up each year, and as high as 15 percent for two years. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-06-04T16:23:09	2014-06-02	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-09652	"We're going to have more troops (in Afghanistan) . . . than the Russians had."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/04/john-murtha/murtha-claims-us-will-have-more-troops-afghanistan/	Rep. John Murtha, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who chairs its defense subcommittee, is one of the Democrats concerned about President Barack Obama's plan to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. On Hardball With Chris Matthew s on Dec. 2, 2009, Murtha said he was worried about the cost and complexity of Obama's strategy. "This is a very complicated thing and very costly operation," said Murtha, D-Pa. "So you know, we got a lot of problems facing us, 104,000 contractors already in Afghanistan, in addition to the 68,000 troops. We're going to have more troops, Chris, than the Russians had in Afghanistan." Murtha said "Russians," but it was clear that he was referring to the Soviet Union, which was still intact when its troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Murtha's comments got us wondering whether the United States would have more troops stationed in the country than the Soviet Union did after it invaded. First, Murtha's claim deserves a little background on Afghanistan's stormy relationship with the Soviet Union. It all started in April 1978, when Afghanistan's communist People's Democratic Party staged a coup and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In the following months, the U.S.S.R. sent troops to Afghanistan to help fend off Islamic insurgents there. What started out as an aid operation turned into a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The Soviet-Afghan war lasted nine years. Estimates of the Soviet troops vary. In 1989, when the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan, the New York Times reported that there had been 115,000 troops at the height of the war. Other estimates peg the number at 118,000 and 120,000. Currently, the United States has approximately 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, and is planning to send 30,000 more, bringing the total number to about 100,000. So, Murtha is off by at least 15,000 troops. The Soviets had more. We asked Murtha's office about his statement, and his spokesman, Matt Mazonkey, said the congressman is right if NATO allies are included. Indeed, including foreign troops would bring the number up to 140,000. Murtha did not make this clear on Hardball; we believe most viewers would interpret his "we" to mean the United States. But since the United States is directing the effort, it's conceivable that some might include the total force with NATO allies, in which case Murtha would be correct. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04714	U.S. military uniforms are manufactured in China.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/02/anthony-gemma/anthony-gemma-asks-why-us-military-uniforms-are-ma/	The revelation that uniforms for the U.S. Olympic team were made in China caused quite a stir in July. A similar issue came up Aug. 28 during the last half-hour of the 90-minute Providence Journal - WPRI-TV debate between Democrats Anthony Gemma and David Cicilline. The two will face off in the Sept. 11 primary as Gemma tries to take over Cicilline's seat in the 1st Congressional District. When the candidates were asked whether they would consider an increased tax on Chinese imports, Cicilline went in another direction, expressing outrage over the foreign-made Olympic garments. He had jumped on the issue when the controversy broke out, staging a photo-op at Northwest Woolen Mills in Woonsocket, which already makes berets for the U.S. military. The Olympic berets, he argued, could have easily been made there. Then it was Gemma's turn. "Mr. Cicilline refers to the Olympic clothing that happened, but how about uniforms?" he said. "How about our servicemen and women's uniforms that are manufactured in China?" Just the thought of that happening put our knickers in a twist, so we set out on a not-so-covert mission to find out if it was true. We e-mailed Gemma spokesman Alex Morash Thursday morning. When we didn't hear from him for several hours, we called him; the voicemail said he wasn't accepting calls or messages. We e-mailed him again Friday afternoon. We also called the Pentagon and heard back from two other agencies. One was the Air Force, whose spokeswoman Capt. Shannon Stoneking said in an e-mail, "All of our AF uniforms are made in the USA." The other was the Defense Logistics Agency, which is responsible for procuring dress and utility uniforms, along with footwear, headgear, medals and insignia for all four branches of the U.S. military and the Coast Guard. Spokeswoman Mikia Muhammad told us that "DLA is mandated to buy 100-percent domestic material with all manufacturing completed in the United States." It's not a policy. It's federal law. The source is the Berry Amendment, USC, Title 10, Section 2533a, originally passed in 1941 to require a buy-American policy for the military. The latest version, which took effect Nov. 16, 2006, prohibits the Department of Defense from buying items of clothing "unless they are wholly of U.S. origin." There are exceptions for small purchases and for cases in which supplies are urgently needed for troops in the field -- uniforms are unlikely to fall into that category. But even in such cases, it must be demonstrated that the items cannot be acquired in sufficient quantity from U.S. manufacturers. One reason for the amendment: If the military were to use manufacturers in a foreign country, supplies could be cut off if problems arose between the two nations. The Air Force addressed the issue in a 2009 news release examining why the United States didn't save money by letting major clothing companies provide uniforms. It quotes Maj. Michael Perry, clothing program manager for the Air Force: "All of the uniform items -- service dress, PT, utility, flight suits -- must be manufactured in the U.S. The [Berry] amendment holds us to this in order to preserve not only American business, but national security." The only exception we could find in searching the Internet came in the wake of a 2000 decision to make black berets standard headgear for the Army. To issue them by the fall of 2001, a waiver was granted to allow several foreign firms, including some with facilities in China, to make 4.7 million berets. (But the first contract went to an Arkansas-based company that, according to a Congressional Research Service report, had been making military headgear since World War I.) Because of the controversy that erupted, the Department of Defense decided not to distribute 618,000 berets made by a United Kingdom company operating in China, according to an undated story in Army Times. But 240,000 berets made in Sri Lanka were shipped. The Gemma campaign never did respond to our inquiry. Our ruling Anthony Gemma, raising a question during an Aug. 28 debate appearance, said uniforms for U.S. soldiers "are manufactured in China." But federal law prohibits the military from buying foreign-made uniforms without special authorization, stemming from the Berry Amendment of more than 70 years ago. We could find no evidence that any U.S. military uniforms are currently being made outside the United States. Even a search of the Internet, where you can usually find "support" for just about any idea, uncovered only one instance, involving the Army berets, and that was more than a decade ago. Perhaps some knockoff uniforms sold to the public come from foreign countries. But those aren't uniforms for our soldiers. We don't know where Gemma buys his clothing, but regardless of its origin, we hope he has flame-retardant undies because the Truth-O-Meter rules this ridiculous claim a Pants On Fire!

pomt-01237	"Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/18/barack-obama/obama-us-has-put-more-people-back-work-all-other-a/	By key measures, America’s labor market has crept back to pre-recession levels, leading President Barack Obama to repeat a talking point in recent days -- that the American economy has outperformed that of other advanced countries. On Nov. 16, 2014, Obama spoke with reporters in Brisbane, Australia, following the ninth G20 summit -- a gathering of leaders from 20 of the world’s major economies. The G20 summit followed a high-profile tour to meet leaders of major Asian countries. Obama said the gatherings "came against the backdrop of America’s renewed economic strength." "The United States is in the longest stretch of uninterrupted private-sector job growth in its history," he said. "Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined." We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that "we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." The new version Obama offered at the G20 summit was slightly better, since it uses a more flexible time frame -- "over the last few years" -- rather than the more specific "since I came into office." If you start counting the day he came into office -- a period when the United States economy was still several months away from hitting rock bottom -- the statement is incorrect. At the G20, Obama changed his language from "created more jobs" to "we’ve put more people back to work." This makes it sound as if the specific people put out of work by the recession (or at least, the general types of people who lost their jobs in the recession) are now working again. It would seem like the evidence for this is equivocal at best. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? First, we’ll recap what we found out about job creation in advanced economies in our previous fact-check, using International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as "advanced economies" and seven of those as "major advanced economies." We looked at total average annual employment from 2009 -- Obama’s first year in office -- through 2014. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or group 2009 employment 2014 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.9 million 145.9 million 5.98 million 4.27 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.5 million 332.8 million 6.28 million 1.92 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.1 million 200.8 million 4.72 million 2.41 percent (For the full data, check out this Google spreadsheet.) According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by just shy of 6 million people. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure at about 5.7 million.) Obama had said this number was more than all advanced economies combined, but that’s not the case -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 6.28 million. That does make it fairly close, and it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is close, but not exact. What about if you change the wording to putting "more people back to work," as Obama said? To support its claim, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis "finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)." The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share "vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)." However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people "back to work," as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009. Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office. If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that "the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat." This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that "we’ve put more people back to work" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. "Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?" Sinclair said. "This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph." Our ruling Obama said, "Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined." From publicly available data, we know that since 2009, the United States has created roughly the same number of jobs as the 35 other advanced economies combined, and more than the other six biggest economies. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting "more people back to work," as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-11-18T11:00:20	2014-11-16	['None']
pomt-05380	Says Ohio law gives tax breaks "to rich people who own private jets."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/08/mike-foley/mike-foley-says-ohio-gives-tax-breaks-rich-people-/	Ohio law contains 128 tax breaks that cost the state about $7 billion per year in lost revenue it otherwise would collect, according to the Department of Taxation. State Rep. Mike Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants to close some of these loopholes so the state has more money for schools, safety forces and other local government services. Foley co-sponsored a bill in February to establish a committee that would review the state’s tax exemptions every two years. More recently, he tried to get approval for his plan by adding it to a broadly supported general tax bill, House Bill 508, under consideration in the House of Representatives on April 25. Foley said during a floor speech that tax exemptions need to be reviewed because some of them are "fairly silly," such as a sales tax exemption related to private jets. "I don’t think we need to be giving exemptions to rich people who own private jets," Foley said. "We’re giving tax breaks to guys that own private jets – that doesn’t make any sense." Foley’s statement hits on individual tax burdens, a frequently discussed political topic that resonates with many voters. So PolitiFact Ohio decided dig into Foley’s claim. Foley’s office provided us with a handful of documents to back up his claim, including a tax expenditure report presented in March 2011 by the Ohio Department of Taxation. But before we examine the report and whether it supports Foley’s claim, let’s look into how these tax breaks work. Here is the Taxation Department’s explanation: "Tax expenditures represent tax dollars that are foregone through deductions, exemptions, credits, and other provisions in tax laws," the tax expenditure report says. "Tax expenditures result in a loss of tax revenue to state government, thereby reducing the funds available for other government programs. In essence, a tax expenditure has the same fiscal impact as a direct government expenditure." Among the tax exemptions in the report is one for people who buy a share of a private jet, or what is called a "fractionally-owned aircraft." This particular tax break was passed in 2003 as part of the state budget. It does have some limitations. It was crafted to apply only to those who do business with qualified companies that provide fractional ownership of private jets. Qualified companies would operate at least 100 aircraft and meet other criteria. The tax break does not apply to individuals who buy their own private jet. Foley did mention fractional ownership at another point during his floor speech: "If you won a fractional or some other sort of ownership of a private jet, then we’re giving you an exemption on your taxes." The tax loophole caps sales tax at $800 for the sum of shares of a fractionally owned jet. Fractional owners are charged a fraction of the $800 that corresponds with their ownership stake. So if somebody owns one-eighth of the jet, he would pay $100 in sales tax. There are only two companies in Ohio that fit the requirements as a qualified company for this exemption, according to the Department of Taxation. That means only people who buy their fractional ownership from one of these two companies qualify for the tax break. The department, however, would not disclose those companies because "the law prohibits disclosure of almost all information on specific taxpayers," taxation department spokesman Gary Gudmundson said in an e-mail. Although the state would not say which two companies qualify for the exemption, NetJets and Flight Options are two prominent fractionally owned aircraft companies based in Ohio. When lawmakers debated the merits of the tax break in 2003, a fractional-ownership company reported that its average share cost was $1.2 million, according to a Department of Taxation analysis of this tax expenditure produced in Jan. 2011. The analysis did not name the company. The taxation department last year estimated in its tax expenditure report that the tax break for fractionally owned aircraft costs the state about $1 million a year. So what does all this mean for Foley’s claim? There is no doubt that a tax loophole exists for people who buy a stake in a private jet. A listener hearing Foley’s quip about tax breaks for rich people buying private jets could believe he was referring to anyone who buys a private plane. The tax break, however, only applies to fractional ownership programs. That’s additional information that provides clarity. And to his credit, Foley did mention fractional ownership at a different point in his speech on the House floor. And the average share price previously reported -- $1.2 million – suggests the tax exemption would be available wealthy people, just as Foley claimed. On the Truth-O-Meter, Foley’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Mike Foley	None	None	None	2012-05-08T06:00:00	2012-04-25	['Ohio']
pomt-08173	"Over half of the foreign-born population in Rhode Island is white."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/01/steven-brown/ri-aclu-director-says-more-half-states-foreign-bor/	Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's promise to rescind the executive order on immigration enacted by his predecessor, Donald Carcieri, has brought Rhode Island's simmering immigration debate back to life. Supporters of the 2008 order say it has given the state new tools to curb illegal immigration, but critics, the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union among them, say it hasn't worked and has marginalized the Hispanic community. One of the order's eight directives requires the state police to work with federal authorities to help enforce immigration laws. In a Nov. 20 Providence Journal story and in a subsequent letter to Chafee, ACLU Director Steven Brown decried the fact that 77 percent of the people investigated by the state police for suspected immigration violations were born in Latin American countries, despite the fact that "over half of the foreign-born population in Rhode Island is white." That statistic about the foreign-born population caught our attention, so we decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter. Brown directed us to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 2006-2008, which includes three-year estimates of foreign-born populations in the United States. Specifically, he said he was citing the figures showing that 45.2 percent of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white. That's not more than half. The ACLU director conceded that he misread the data and meant to say "'almost half' not ''over half.' " Fair enough. But things get more complicated when you dig deeper into census figures to examine the point behind Brown's statement -- that Hispanics are being investigated more often than non-Hispanics. The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey is an ongoing statistical analysis that's conducted through questionnaires on various demographic topics mailed monthly to homes; the bureau produces reports as often as once a year. The survey asks respondents to identify their race. Among the choices: white, black or African American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska native, native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander. There is no option to select Hispanic. That's because, according to the U.S. Census, "Hispanic" is an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics and Latinos have the option of checking off one of the above races or a final box labeled "some other race," according to Arthur Bakis, information services specialist at the bureau's Boston regional office. The race standards are defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and have been in place for decades, according to Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, D.C. Typically, about half of foreign-born Hispanic respondents across the United States identify themselves as white and about 40 percent answer "some other race," said Charles A. Gallagher, chairman of the sociology department at La Salle University in Philadelphia. The 45.2 percent statistic that Brown cited for Rhode Island was the total percentage of foreign-born people here who identified their race as white. So on its face, Brown's "more than half" statement was not too far off. But there is a broader context to consider. The more relevant statistic to Brown's point comes from the previous question on the same survey. It asks respondents whether they are of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, or not. Drawing from data in the 2006-2008 survey, the census said that 32 percent of foreign-born people, about one third, are white alone, not Hispanic or Latino. Bakis of the Census Bureau and Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center agree that is the data that Brown should have used if he wanted to properly quantify the size of Rhode Island's foreign born, non-Hispanic white population. "It's a mistake that people who are not familiar with the data might make," said Passel. (It's worth noting that Brown cites figures from the 2006-2008, three-year American Community Survey. A one-year report from 2009 showed that 30 percent of Rhode Island respondents identified themselves as "white alone, not Hispanic or Latino." But Census officials say the three-year survey is more accurate, so that's the one we relied on.) In the end, Brown's underlying claim that the state police investigate Hispanics more often than non-Hispanics for immigration violations is supported by the department's own numbers. Of the 92 people investigated, 71 were from Latin American countries. But that's not what we were checking. Instead, we examined the assertion Brown made to support his argument: that more than half of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white. And in that claim, he misstated the percentage -- by a small amount if you count all who said they were white, but a larger amount if you count those who consider themselves white alone, not Hispanic or Latino. We rate this Half True.	None	Steven Brown	None	None	None	2010-12-01T00:01:00	2010-11-20	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-08791	"Mark Sharpe has lowered property taxes by 17 percent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/mark-sharpe/hillsborough-commission-candidate-mark-sharpe-clai/	The District 7 at-large Republican primary race for Hillsborough County commissioner has focused a great deal on taxes, mostly a proposed sales tax increase. That’s because challenger Josh Burgin has consistently bashed incumbent Mark Sharpe for backing a ballot question that asks voters if they support raising the sales tax by 1 cent. The proceeds would pay for new commuter rail, expanded bus service and roads. Sharpe has tried to shore up his image as a fiscal conservative, claiming in a July 20 mailer that he’s a tax cutter. "Mark Sharpe has lowered property taxes by 17 percent," his piece claims. His number seemed a bit generous to the skeptical eye, so PolitiFact Florida dusted off its copies of Hillsborough County’s budget. First, we parsed his word choice and immediately puckered. Sharpe claims he lowered property taxes. That struck us as overly boastful, since it takes a majority vote of commissioners to approve county spending plans. Sharpe has voted on five final annual budgets, and each vote was unanimous. If property taxes were indeed cut, Sharpe can’t take all the credit. We also immediately seized on the assertion that he cut property taxes, period. We wondered if he meant that he supported cutting the tax rate. It’s an important distinction. Hillsborough commissioners regularly brag about the number of consecutive years they have lowered the tax rate. But, as the St. Petersburg Times has shown in the past, tax revenue soared in the early and middle part of this decade at a pace that far outstripped population growth and inflation. (See "The Money Vat" here.) That’s because the generally modest annual tax rate cuts didn’t come close to offsetting the money brought in by escalating property values and a building boom. If you didn’t own a house with a homestead exemption that capped annual tax increase in those years, your property tax bill skyrocketed. Of course, the market has tanked since then. So perhaps it’s possible that Sharpe can claim commissioners cut the tax rate — and taxes. We checked with Sharpe’s campaign, which said it got the base numbers from one of his aides. The aide provided the figures used and a percentage-change calculation. As suspected, his calculation was based on tax-rate figures, not actual tax bills or county tax revenues. The aide compared only the portion of the tax rate that applies to all county property owners, not the extra amount tacked on in unincorporated areas for such things as police and fire protection. Fair enough, perhaps, as long as he was using consistent figures. However, the aide used the wrong budget figure from the year before Sharpe took office. If he had used the correct starting number and year, his boss might have legitimately claimed a role in reducing the countywide property tax rate by 20 percent. PolitiFact decided to start from scratch, comparing the combined rate for all property taxes commissioners control from the time Sharpe took office until now. Then we looked at how much money that brought in annually through the same time period. Sharpe took office in November 2004. The county’s fiscal year runs from October through September. That means Sharpe began working in fiscal year 2005, and his first budget vote in September 2005 set spending levels for fiscal year 2006. When he took office, the county’s overall tax rate was 13.0164 mills. That means that for every $1,000 of property owned, Hillsborough County taxes were roughly $13.02. Commissioners voted each year since to lower the millage. It currently stands at 10.7614 mills. Do the math, and it turns out that the tax rate is indeed currently 17 percent lower than when Sharpe took office. Yet there’s still one problem with that. In 2007, the state legislature took action forcing most local governments across Florida to sharply roll back their property tax rates to compensate for their failure to do so aggressively in the boom years. While the tax rate has fallen by 2.2550 mills while Sharpe has been in office, well more than half of that — nearly 1.5 mills — came in the budget that immediately followed the state order. In other words, it was a direct response to what the legislature did. Legislators gave local governments the option of ignoring their edict if commissioners could muster a super-majority vote of five of the seven commissioners. While Hillsborough commissioners opted not to do that, the impetus for the 2007 tax cut further undermines Sharpe’s assertion that he reduced taxes by 17 percent. Then there is the question of whether, in fact, taxes have fallen that much. The county’s combined property taxes brought in $610.8 million during Sharpe’s first year in office, budget records show. They are projected to bring in $659.8 million this year. That’s an 8 percent increase. A good part of that is new construction. But it’s also a reflection that tax rate cuts, combined with plummeting property values, still haven’t quite offset the boom years that included the early part of Sharpe’s tenure. It’s why your tax bill may still be higher than when you purchased in 2005, despite politicians’ claims of tax cuts. With another modest tax reduction tentatively approved for next year and property values still falling, tax receipts are finally projected to be 4 percent less than when Sharpe got elected. Sharpe told PolitiFact that it’s difficult to capture all the nuances in a short sentence aimed at grabbing voters’ attention. We understand that. But with a couple of slight word adjustments — Mark Sharpe supported a 17 percent cut in the tax rate — he could have easily earned a better rating. There is obviously a grain of truth in Sharpe’s claim. But he claimed full responsibility for cuts enabled by others and largely mandated by the state. And those cuts still have not produced an overall drop in tax revenues. So we must rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mark Sharpe	None	None	None	2010-08-19T18:13:01	2010-07-20	['None']
pomt-10250	Three years ago, John McCain said, "Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/28/joe-biden/biden-digs-back-on-afghanistan-to-dig-mccain/	Speaking to the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 27, 2008, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden questioned John McCain's judgment on U.S. progress in Afghanistan — cherry-picking a comment McCain made three years ago. Biden used McCain's assessment to nip at the Republican on his decisionmaking compared to Barack Obama's. "Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only three years ago, 'Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded?' " Biden said. The McCain comment stems from an Oct. 31, 2005, appearance on the Charlie Rose talk show on PBS. He was asked about winning in Iraq. After discussing issues confronting that country, McCain concluded: "Afghanistan, we don't read about anymore, because it's succeeded. And by the way, there's several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is." It wasn't the first time that year McCain lauded "success" in Afghanistan — but it was more unqualified than other assessments. A couple of weeks later, on Nov. 10, 2005, McCain told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, "One of the reasons why we don't see a lot about Afghanistan is because many of the successes — although we still have a long way to go through — that we have." He added he would "love to see more troops there." In February 2005, McCain suggested permanent military bases were needed, according to the Associated Press. His office later clarified that permanent bases were not necessarily required, but noted America had to remain in the country to remove the "last vestiges" of the Taliban and al-Qaida. This year, McCain said he would support adding more U.S. and Afghan soldiers, strengthening the government there. He promised it would "turn around the war in Afghanistan," where the Taliban have expanded attacks recently and American troops in July rose to 36,000, their highest level. Although Biden was selective in his choice of McCain's words, he correctly quotes what McCain said three years ago. We rule his statement True.

pomt-12880	"A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. … People loved it. Loved and liked."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trumps-inaugural-speech-polled-well-not-wel/	During an interview with ABC News’ David Muir, President Donald Trump -- as he has been known to do -- took the opportunity to tout some of his poll numbers. "A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it," Trump said Jan. 25, 2017. "Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll." So, is he right? We took a closer look. When we contacted the White House, they told us that the poll in question was the Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Jan. 25, five days after the inauguration. The poll surveyed 1,922 registered voters, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. The relevant question was, "Based on what you have seen, read or heard recently about Donald Trump’s inauguration speech, would you say it was excellent, good, only fair or poor?" The question was only asked of the 1,762 people who said they watched the address, which the pollster said was "a sample that’s slightly more Republican than the overall poll, although (it) still skews Democratic." The results? A plurality -- 49 percent -- thought Trump’s speech was "excellent" or "good." By comparison, 39 percent thought the speech was either fair or poor. So, Trump has a point: In isolation, at least, that’s a pretty good score. It’s also a similar result to another poll that asked essentially the same question. Gallup asked, "Based on what you have heard or read, how would you rate Donald Trump's inauguration speech? Would you rate it as -- excellent, good, just okay, poor or terrible?" Gallup surveyed 508 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The poll found that 53 percent thought the speech was "excellent" or "good," while 42 percent thought it was "just okay," "poor," or "terrible." So both surveys found positive responses outpacing negative responses by about 10 percentage points, with positive responses accounting for either a majority or nearly a majority. The one caveat we’ll mention is that Trump’s showing wasn’t as positive as that of other recent presidents. Gallup has asked this question for the previous three inaugural addresses -- George W. Bush’s in 2005 and Barack Obama’s in 2009 and 2013. Trump’s "excellent plus good" score of 53 percent trailed all three. The score for Bush in 2005 was 62 percent, while Obama received 81 percent in 2009 and 65 percent in 2013. In addition, Trump got the worst-ever "terrible" score -- 14 percent, which was twice as high as the previous record, for Obama’s second inaugural speech. Our ruling Trump said, "A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. … People loved it. Loved and liked." He has a point that in both the Politico/Morning Consult poll and the Gallup poll, favorable opinions outpaced unfavorable opinions by double-digit margins. However, it’s worth noting that Trump’s positive score in the Gallup poll was between 9 and 28 points lower than the scores in the previous three inaugural addresses.

pomt-02039	"Qataris don't really work."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/02/jeremy-schaap/espns-schaap-qataris-dont-need-work/	File this under the category of be careful what you wish for. Four years ago, Qatar emerged triumphant when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, better known as FIFA, voted to hold the 2022 World Cup in the oil and gas rich emirate. Qatar’s bid involved massive construction plans for new stadiums, rail lines and virtually an entire new city. It would be the marquee event for a country that aims to transform itself into an intercontinental crossroads. But controversy followed almost as soon as the decision was announced. With daytime temperatures hitting 120 degrees there has been talk of shifting the games from the summer to the winter. Then last year, a newspaper exposé led to an official investigation that Qatar paid million dollar bribes to win FIFA approval. A member of the FIFA Executive Committee called the Qatar pick a "blatant mistake." Qatar’s treatment of foreign workers also has come into the spotlight. Amnesty International and other human rights groups report rampant abuse in the construction industry. ESPN host Jeremy Schaap went to Doha to investigate allegations of laborers from India, Nepal and elsewhere who find themselves toiling in brutal heat, dying in accidents and locked into jobs with no way to get back home because their passports had been confiscated. "We're talking about a country that can afford to do better," Schaap said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. Schaap noted that per capita, Qatar is the richest nation in the world. "Qataris don't really work. They don't have to work," Schaap said, claiming that the Qatari government offers generous benefits for the unemployed. Schaap’s statement that Qataris "don’t really work" struck us as worth learning more about. We asked Schaap to clarify. In his response, he dialed down his rhetoric. "I should have said as laborers on construction sites," Schaap told PunditFact. He added that 94 percent of those workers are foreign -- a fact that came up during his MSNBC interview. This led to a further qualification of the more sweeping statement he made on air. "It's not quite ‘no Qataris’," he said. Indeed, official statistics show that most Qataris 15 years old and up are employed. According to the CIA’s World Factbook, the country has the second lowest unemployment rate in the world, about 0.3 percent. (Definitions of employment might matter here. Cambodia comes in first and its economy is hardly as robust as Qatar’s.) According to the latest figures from the government of Qatar itself, a total of 82,000 Qataris are working out of a total population estimated at 278,000. (Oddly, the government doesn’t provide population data by nationality.) That represents 68 percent of men over the age of 15 and 35 percent of women. A large fraction of women are listed as "homemakers" and thus not employed. The most common job for men is clerk. The most common job for women is professional. Schaap does have a point that the government takes good care of its ciitizens. In 2008, nearly 90 percent of Qataris worked in public-sector jobs. A huge factor here is the state-owned petroleum industry. Oil exports netted the government over $55 billion in 2012 and hydrocarbons represent about 60 percent of the nation's GDP. A new college graduate with no experience can expect a job paying $65,000 or more. The country has more than 1.25 million foreign workers. About 700,000 of them are men working in trades or industrial facilities. On average, they work about 50 hours per week. That’s 10 hours more each week than the average Qatari worker. All this in a country the size of Connecticut. Following a tough assessment from the UN’s International Labor Organization, Qatari officials proposed a number of labor reforms. There would be higher penalties for employers who confiscate the passports of foreign workers and an end to a system of exit permits that gave employers control over who could leave the country. International advocacy groups called this a step in the right direction but said the proposed changes didn’t go far enough and violators might never be punished. Our ruling Schaap said Qataris "don’t really work." Schaap later clarified his statement, saying he should have specified that he was thinking of work on construction sites, and even with that caveat, his claim went a bit too far. We rate statements based on what was said on air. In that regard, official reports show that most Qataris of working age do work and hold a variety of jobs. In one way or another, the government provides nearly all these jobs but people still need to show up to get paid. A small fraction of the construction workforce is Qatari. The risks for foreign workers are real, but that is separate from Schaap’s assertion. We rate the claim False.	None	Jeremy Schaap	None	None	None	2014-06-02T11:45:38	2014-05-28	['None']
pomt-14779	"There is a federal criminal law that says it's a crime to transport dentures across state lines."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/07/bob-goodlatte/goodlattes-says-clim/	Our jaws dropped when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte called for the repeal of a federal law banning the transport of dentures across state lines. Does such a law really exist? Goodlatte, R-6th, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made the statement during a Nov. 24 radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show" in Portsmouth. He was touting a bill his committee passed Nov. 18 that would strike a number of what he considers to be superfluous laws. "There is a federal criminal law that says it’s a crime to transport dentures across state lines," he said. "So we’re getting rid of that." Seeking more information, we contacted Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s communications director. She pointed us to a section of the U.S. code called the Federal Denture Act of 1942. It’s a murky law, and we had trouble finding experts who know about it. It turns out that some states have laws that only dentures provided by licensed dentists can be sold within their borders, and other states don’t have that mandate. The federal law says its purpose is to protect the integrity of state laws requiring dentist-made false teeth and to promote good oral health. Those who violate the law can be charged criminally or reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We wondered how often people have been charged with the federal crime. Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, told us his department looked back over the past decade, starting in 2004, and could not find records of any charges being filed under the provision. If no one is being prosecuted, is there still any value in having the law? The answer depends on who makes the dentures. Maria Lopez Howell, a consumer adviser with the American Dental Association, said the law protects people by making sure their dentures are provided by someone "who has been trained to do this very customized work." On the other side of the fence are denturists - technicians who have been trained in making dentures but do not have medical degrees. Paul M. Levasseur, secretary of the National Denturist Association, called the restriction on interstate transport of false teeth "a strange law." "While I've never heard of anyone being prosecuted, it is probably a case of protectionism by organized dentistry," Levasseur said in an email. The New York Times documented the dispute between dentists and denturists in 2007. Denturists said they were highly trained and sometimes work under the supervision of a dentist. The ADA said the technicians aren’t trained to diagnose mouth diseases or to spot broken roots of teeth, which can cause harm if not corrected before dentures are inserted. All of this debate, however, ignores a more basic question: Can grandpa wear his false teeth across state lines without the risk of prosecution? The answer is yes. "If you have a family member who has dentures, they can still travel across the United States without any consequences," Howell said. Levasseur told us, "I believe this deals with commerce not individuals." Our ruling Goodlatte said it’s a federal crime "to transport dentures across state lines." He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws. A 73-year-old federal law does make it a crime for non-dentists who make false teeth to ship their wares out of state. But it doesn’t restrict citizens from wearing their dentures wherever they go. The congressman didn’t mention that. So Goodlatte’s claim is accurate but needs a clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2015-12-07T00:00:00	2015-11-24	['None']
pomt-14336	Says Barack Obama was happily photographed holding a T-shirt with revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara’s face on it.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/mar/25/sid-miller/miller-posts-fake-photo-obama-holding-che-guevara-/	During President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba, he took in a baseball game, met with leader Raul Castro and attended a wreath ceremony for a Cuban journalist and poet. In the background of the ceremony was a mural of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara several stories high on the side of a building. Guevara, who met exiled brothers Fidel and Raul Castro in Mexico in 1955, and was a key figure in the Cuban Revolution that overthrew the dictator Fulgencio Batista. Obama’s photo in front of the mural drew criticism, but according to one Republican politician, it wasn’t the only such picture. Back in Texas, Sid Miller, the state’s agriculture commissioner, posted a photo to his Facebook fan page that provided a rare, if unseen, glimpse into Obama’s Havana trip from 1,000 miles away. In a March 22, 2016 post on his Facebook fan page, Miller shared a photo of the president holding a blue T-shirt adorned with the face of Guevara, with the caption: "President Obama refuses to return to the United States in order to meet with European leaders to discuss a response to today's terror attacks in Brussels -- attacks that severely injured a number of Americans. Instead, he remains in Cuba holding a shirt depicting the image of Che Guevara--one of the most reviled terrorists of the modern age -- a murdering thug who was responsible for thousands of innocent deaths. President Obama is laughing at us. He understands the symbolism of this picture and yet he doesn't care. I believe his actions are disgraceful. Do you agree?" First, a little background. As Texas' agriculture commissioner, Miller is charged with running the national school breakfast and lunch programs, protecting crops from pests and disease and regulating all fuel pumps in the state, among other duties. He also has a flair for newsworthy behavior. In his first act as commissioner, he granted amnesty to cupcakes as an approved dessert and got national attention for lifting a ban to allow deep fat fryers back in public schools. His Facebook presence shares headline-grabbing material. In one example, a photo on his Facebook page showed a detonated atom bomb with a caption that read, "Japan has been at peace with the US since August 9, 1945. It’s time we made peace with the Muslim world." The photo was taken down less than 24 hours later. Miller’s team said a staffer posted the photo, not him. Recently, he’s drawn attention for taking a taxpayer-funded trip to Oklahoma to get a supposed cure-all injection known as the "Jesus Shot." Back to the images. It’s clear a photo captured Obama in front of a Guevara mural. But Miller claimed he went further and picked up a shirt on his oft-criticized Cuba trip. Standing in front of an image that’s permanently there and voluntarily holding up that same image are different things. We had to know if the leader of the free world knowingly posed with an image of the revolutionary, as Miller claimed. We called Miller’s office and emailed the White House; neither immediately replied. But we quickly came across several news articles declaring the photo a fake -- including a Houston Chronicle story that found an image believed to be the original from a 2009 presidential visit to a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the original photo, Obama is holding a T-shirt emblazoned with lengthy equations, which an online thread describes as the "Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the conservation-of-mass equation." Next, we did a reverse Google image search to determine if similar images exist. The Chronicle article read through comments on Miller’s Facebook post alleging the photo was fake, and found a Reddit thread from 2009 that explained the science on the original T-shirt in question. Our results brought up "visually similar images" of Obama holding up a blue T-shirt with a series of equations on them, as well as links to pages that included matching images. Most links were from Getty Images, showing Obama in 2009 also wearing the same pink dotted tie. Another link went to a San Antonio Current article debunking the photo. The photo caption: "US President Barack Obama holds a T-shirt given to him as he toured a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an institution that has been developing cutting-edge clean energy technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 23, 2009." Even in the background of the Miller Facebook photo, behind Obama’s head, there is a poster labeled "Center for Excitonics." In the Getty image picture, the poster is in the same position. An online search for the center landed us on the center’s MIT web page. So, we wondered, did Obama drop in at some time and did he smile while holding a blue T shirt? We called and emailed the lab to ask if the supposed original Getty image was taken there, and if Obama visited in 2009. Kimberly Allen, MIT’s media relations director, replied to our email and confirmed the Getty image link we included in the email was in fact taken in their lab, and the president visited in October 2009. Allen said MIT did not own the original photo of Obama holding up the T-shirt, but she provided a web link to a photo of the president dressed in the same suit exploring a lab with a poster in the background reading "Center for Excitonics." Also, in the reverse Google image search, some of the "visually similar images" showed Obama holding the T-shirt in the lab with a man with a beard in a colorful printed shirt. In the link Allen sent over, the header image showed Obama watching the same man, Professor Alex Slocum, do a demonstration. As of March 25, the post and photo remained on Miller's Facebook page despite several comments below it linking to news articles such as the Chronicle’s claiming the picture is fake. Our ruling Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a picture on Facebook showing President Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary figure Che Guevara’s face on it. The photo accompanies a mini-rant from Miller complaining that the president was rubbing elbows with Cuba’s communist leaders instead of flying back to Washington in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. The pic is a doctored version of a photo from Obama’s 2009 visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Excitonics Lab. The T-shirt in the original photo read "And Moses said " followed by equations that govern the flow of fluids, concluding "and the waters parted." Get it? (A lot of nerds weren’t impressed either, questioning why Moses saying the equations out loud would cause the Red Sea to part, a scene more reminiscent of witchcraft than the invisible hand of God.)

pomt-07231	"Some neighborhood schools are closing."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/02/texas-house-democratic-caucus/house-democrats-say-neighborhood-schools-are-closi/	Urging fellow lawmakers to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to give more money to public schools, a press release distributed by the Texas House Democratic Caucus paints a gloomy picture of the future of education in Texas. "Make no mistake," says the May 18 statement, attributed to six House members, including caucus leader Jessica Farrar of Houston. "Some neighborhood schools are closing. Pre-kindergarten for 100,000 kids, programs that teach kids music and art, Advanced Placement courses in math and science — they’re all under threat. Voting for a budget that leaves out the rainy day fund is a vote to kill these programs." It’s been widely reported that school districts across the state have been making plans to lay off teachers, trim programs and take other measures in anticipation of expected cuts in state education aid. But are districts also shuttering campuses? Texas has more than 8,000 public schools. To our request for specifics on neighborhood school closures, the executive director of the caucus, Roger Garza, sent us a list of more than 90 schools categorized in various ways, including "grade realignment," "announced closure" and "possible closure/consolidation." We sought clarification on some of the entries but received no response. And when we asked the Texas Education Agency for information on schools being closed, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the agency’s database only shows actual — not anticipated — closures, which are typically reported to the state in the summer. "That’s when I would expect any school closed for budget reasons to show up," she said. So we went ahead with our own research, combing through the list sent by the caucus, reading news reports and talking to school districts to find neighborhood schools that are being shuttered because of the coming reductions in state funding. We found seven in all: ** Four elementary schools (serving a total of 1,300 students) in the Houston district. District spokesman Jason Spencer told us that because of proposed state budget cuts, the administration determined that these small schools could no longer afford to provide some key services — for example, have a librarian or a nurse — so they will not open in the fall, saving the district $1.6 million. The Democrats’ list of possible closures includes dozens of other Houston schools that are not facing imminent closure. That may be because in December, the district superintendent, Terry Grier, initiated a review of 66 underutilized campuses, all with low student enrollment. However, he ultimately recommended closing only the four schools. ** An elementary school (490 students) in the Hutto district north of Austin. According to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article, Superintendent Doug Killian said, "Our hope was that if we closed the school and reduced our overhead, that we could keep more jobs overall." District spokeswoman Emily Boswell told us that the closure of Veterans’ Hill Elementary will save the district $1 million next year. ** An elementary school (500 students) in San Antonio’s Edgewood district. An April 19 San Antonio Express-News story describes the school board’s vote to shutter Coronado/Escobar Elementary as "the first school closure in Bexar County related to anticipated state budget cuts." In an April 18 story on KSAT-TV’s website, Superintendent Elizabeth Garza is quoted as saying: "We had to come up with different options to cut our budget by about 10 percent." The closure is projected to save $1.5 million in operating costs, district spokesman Maclovio Perez said. ** An intermediate school (340 students) in the Cedar Hill district, southwest of Dallas. District Chief Financial Officer Mike McSwain told us that the school board voted to close Beltline Intermediate School because of the upcoming reductions in state funding, saving the district $550,000. We also identified four other schools — two in Abilene and two in Little Elm, north of Dallas — that are set to close. However, we did not include them on this list because officials from those districts told us that the closures were in the works before the districts began to plan for the state budget reductions. Finally, we found at least five other districts that have discussed shuttering schools to help solve their budget problems and either decided against it or have yet to make a final decision. Among them is the Austin school district, with more than a dozen campuses identified as "possible" closures on the caucus’s list. According to American-Statesman articles, district officials are now developing a proposal that will take into consideration a task force report recommending that nine schools be closed over the next several years. The school board is not expected to take action on closures until the fall. To the Truth-O-Meter: In their statement, the Democratic legislators indicated that some neighborhood schools would close as a result of state budget cuts. Guess that depends on your definition of "some." The House Democratic caucus sent us a list of more than 90 schools, but we could find only seven — out of thousands across the state — that will shut their doors because the Legislature is reducing education aid. We rate the Democrats’ statement Mostly True.	None	Texas House Democratic Caucus	None	None	None	2011-06-02T06:00:00	2011-05-18	['None']
pomt-05680	Obama's secretary of energy, Dr. Steven Chu, "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels (for gasoline), and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/14/newt-gingrich/gingrich-said-energy-secretary-advocated-raising-g/	Newt Gingrich, who has promised gasoline at $2.50 a gallon if he’s elected president, frequently blames the Obama administration for rising prices at the pump. He recently called President Barack Obama’s energy plan "outrageously anti-American." And in an interview on Fox News Sunday on March 11, 2012, Gingrich said Obama is leading the nation toward "greater dependency and much more expensive gasoline, maybe ultimately as high as $9 or $10 a gallon, which is what his secretary of energy, Dr. Chu, says he wants it to be. "He has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels, and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon." That sounds like it could ruin a lot of road trips. We decided to check that claim about Steven Chu, and while we’re at it -- are Europeans really paying that much to fuel their Fiats? What Chu said Chu is a a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who served as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal energy research center. His quote about European gas prices has become somewhat notorious since he uttered it almost four years ago. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late 2008 -- before Obama was elected and at a point when Chu had no ties to Obama -- Chu told the newspaper that he favored raising gasoline taxes gradually over 15 years to coax consumers into buying fuel-efficient cars and discouraging sprawl. "Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe," Chu said in an interview with the Journal in September 2008. The quote did not appear in print until December, when the Journal ran a story after news emerged that Chu was being tapped as energy secretary. It has been a target of criticism numerous times since then. "The popularity of Chu’s now-infamous quotation tends to track the rise and fall of gas prices: It enjoyed a huge surge of attention last spring and summer (2011) before largely vanishing from view in the fall, leading up to this month’s renaissance," reporter Bob King wrote in a story in POLITICO. As it happens, after Gingrich's comment, Chu backed away from what he said. At a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 13, 2012, Chu said, "Since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I’ve been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to … reduce those prices." Chu added, according to POLITICO, that the "most important tool in DOE’s tool chest is moving off oil." "So are you saying you no longer share the view that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America?" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked him. "I no longer share that view," Chu said. "When I became secretary of Energy, I represented the U.S. government," Chu added. "Of course we don’t want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down." Getting back to Gingrich’s portrayal of Chu’s 2008 remark -- that he "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels" -- Chu’s statement was indeed public. He said it to a newspaper. And he did express a desire to raise domestic gas prices closer to those in Europe. About that $10 gas Gingrich pegged the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Europe at between $9 and $10. We contacted the European Union, which provided this chart showing gasoline prices in various countries as of March 5, 2012. The chart (on page 2 of the document) shows prices in Euros per liter. We converted that into dollars per gallon and came up with these figures: France: $7.07 per gallon Portugal: $7.24 per gallon Italy came in highest at $8.48 per gallon. We also received information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to the chart on page 3 of this document, which shows prices in January 2012, a gallon of gasoline cost $7.54 per gallon in France, $8.07 in Germany and $6.68 in the United Kingdom. The travel website mytravelcost.com reports even higher prices. The site, which says it updates prices monthly, puts a liter of unleaded in France at 1.64 euros. Converted to dollars per gallon, that’s $8.10 per gallon. In Spain, it’s $7.06 per gallon, and in the Netherlands it’s $8.90, according to the website. Our ruling Gingrich said that Chu, the energy secretary, "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels [for gasoline] and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon." Chu’s statement, made to the the Wall Street Journal in 2008, was "somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe." Gingrich’s paraphrase was accurate. As for the price, he aimed a little high. We found examples of gasoline near $9 a gallon in Europe, but none approaching $10. Gasoline prices fluctuate, however, and so does the exchange rate between dollars and euros. But, because of the discrepancy, we rate his statement Mostly True. This story originally provided an incorrect date for the Fox News Sunday program on which Gingrich appeared. It has been corrected to say March 11, 2012. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cab7a2a-1eab-49c8-8bf0-54f9628d4bf2	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-03-14T14:08:36	2012-03-11	['Europe', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01702	Says George Soros and Bill Gates are funding a bioweapons lab in Sierra Leone that caused the Ebola outbreak.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/11/blog-posting/bloggers-bill-and-melinda-gates-george-soros-funde/	The underbelly of the Internet is no place to find credible information about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Last week we brought you example No. 1. Example No. 2 is as follows: Several conspiracy websites have raised questions lately about a "bioweapons lab" in Sierra Leone being the source of the virus. Questions like, "What's behind the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone? Could it possibly be a U.S. bioweapons project gone amuck?" Some of the websites tie the "bioweapons lab" to billionaires George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. "At the epicentre of the current Ebola epidemic is the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which houses a U.S. a (sic) biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation," reads an excerpt shared on sites like RumorMillsNews.com and BeforeItsNews.com. We wanted to set the record straight. Soros and Gates There’s no proof of Soros and Gates funding a bioweapons lab in Kenema, one of the largest cities in Sierra Leone with a population of about 150,000. And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak. "The assertion is absurd," said Chris Williams, spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation did provide a $1 million Ebola-related grant to support emergency efforts in West Africa by UNICEF, he said. A spokeswoman for Soros’ Open Society Foundations also said it does not fund any labs, much less a bioweapons lab, in West Africa. We can’t exactly pinpoint the reason people are connecting Soros and the Gateses to the Ebola outbreak, our best guess is people are trying to insinuate they had something to do with creating the current crisis. One blogger who invoked the Soros/Gates connection, Dublinsmick, referenced the website of the "viral fever bioweapons lab inside Kenema Government Hospital," saying it "read like a roll call of New World Order organizations." The New World Order is a popular conspiracy theory whereby a group of wealthy elites plan to take over the world. Here’s the list, which does not include Soros or Gates: The Consortium is a collaboration between Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital (Sierra Leone), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) and various other partners in West Africa. …The Consortium intends to expand this program to include other important infectious agents such as Ebola, Marburg and other Arenaviruses that are of great concern to public health and bioterrorism," states the bioweapons lab website. This text matches a list of partners of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium, which conducts research at Kenema. No, it does not describe itself as a bioweapons lab. And the program director said there is no financial connection to Gates or Soros. We did find one very, very loose Soros-Gates link. One of the Broad Institute researchers who is part of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium is a Harvard University computational geneticist who earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School as a Soros Fellow, and her work is supported by awards from groups that include the Gates Foundation. Of course, she was also a Rhodes scholar, won a Packard Foundation award in science and engineering, and was recognized by the National Institutes of Health with an Innovator Award. A spokeswoman for the Broad Institute, Haley Bridger, said the institute has not received money from Soros. She said it has received money from the Gates Foundation, but it was for research on tuberculosis, not Ebola. The consortium Before the current Ebola outbreak, members of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium focused their work on a bigger concern in West Africa: Lassa fever, a viral disease with symptoms that resemble Ebola but is more common than Ebola in that area. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded a five-year, $15 million contract to Tulane to continue researching Lassa fever, and the consortium was created in 2010. Tulane University researchers have worked in the area for about a decade to better understand Lassa fever and develop modern diagnostic assays, or tests to see if a person has the fever, and treatments. Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone is a major partner of the research scientists from Tulane and other universities. The multi-facility hospital contains a laboratory and ward dedicated to Lassa fever research and isolating Lassa fever patients. When the first Ebola case was diagnosed in Guinea, about three hours from the Kenema site in in early 2014, a team from the consortium went to Kenema to help the site switch gears. "We were there working 10 years and then Ebola came here," said Dr. Robert Garry, a Tulane University professor and program manager of the consortium. "We’re not here to turn Lassa and Ebola into a kind of superweapon. It can do that on its own." The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases also sometimes works in the facility, Garry said. Part of its mission is to prevent viruses like Ebola and Lassa fever from being used deliberately as bioterrorism agents against soldiers and civilians. It did not respond to our inquiry by our deadline. Ebola infections have cropped up over the years, but the latest spell is the deadliest, with 961 deaths and 1,779 infections reported by the World Health Organization. The first case was reported in Gueckedou, Guinea, in early 2014 before it spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, some of the poorest parts of Africa with limited access to medical care (and in some cases, a deep mistrust among some residents of medical professionals spreading the disease). So, no, it did not start at the country-owned hospital in Kenema, though the city is a major player in a very dispersed outbreak. The hospital’s medical staff is in the thick of treating patients infected with the Ebola virus, and several nurses and doctors have died in the course of treating patients. That includes Dr. Sheik Umar Kahn, a worldwide pioneer of Ebola research from Sierra Leone who died July 28. Kahn was the physician in charge of the Lassa Fever Program at the Kenema hospital, so he worked with researchers from Tulane and elsewhere. "The conspiracy theories really just kind of, wow," Garry said. "Our teammates are dying, and you’re talking this trash about us." Our ruling Bloggers worried about the New World Order connected the bank accounts of Soros and Gates to a facility responding to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone -- a facility they strongly suggest is responsible for the outbreak. A direct link to the billionaires is unproven. One researcher who received education and research grants from their foundations does not warrant the much-hyped connection. Moreover, the virus did not start from a research lab in Kenema, giving the bloggers’ incendiary claims even less credibility. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00948	"200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/feb/20/marjorie-sanfilippo/florida-legislature-weighs-allowing-guns-college-c/	A shooting incident at Florida State University late last year has re-opened a debate in the Florida Legislature about whether to allow guns on college campuses. Gunman Myron May, a former FSU student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. In January, a Florida House panel voted to advance a bill that would allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their guns on campuses. Then, on Feb. 16, a Senate panel approved the bill. Both votes broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition. The bill in question would allow concealed carry permit holders, who must be 21, to carry their firearms into any college or university facility. About 1.3 million people have Florida concealed-carry permits, including about 250,000 between the ages of 21 to 35. During the Senate hearing, college professors and students were among those who testified -- and they came armed with loads of statistics. Marjorie Sanfilippo, an Eckerd College psychology professor who has researched youth access to firearms, expressed concern about allowing guns on campuses. One issue, she said, is that some college students have mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. In fact, college is sometimes the time of life when major illnesses, such as bipolar mood disorder and schizophrenia, first appear. (May, a 31-year-old lawyer who returned to the FSU campus with a gun, suffered from mental health problems.) "What proponents of this bill won’t tell you is that 200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses -- an all too common event. Is it a stretch to speculate that more of these suicide attempts would be lethal if students had firearms?" Are suicide attempts that widespread on college campuses? We took a closer look at the available statistics. Statistics on attempted suicide and colleges Sanfilippo told PolitiFact Florida that she took her data from an assessment by the American College Health Association, an advocacy organization for colleges and universities. The association has been collecting health data about college students since 2000. About 76,000 students at 157 colleges and universities took part in the spring of 2012. (The survey included Florida institutions but the association doesn’t release the names of those who participated.) The survey published in 2014 found that about 1.2 percent of college students reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months. There are approximately 20 million college and university students; doing the arithmetic, this translates into about 200,000 suicide attempts. (The association has found similar rates in other years.) Mary Hoban, who oversees the assessment, told PolitiFact Florida there are two caveats. First, the data is self-reported from studies, and second, the schools self-select to participate, "so our data are not truly generalizable." We searched for additional data on suicide attempts by college students. Researchers at the University of Texas found that 1 percent of undergraduates had attempted suicide within the past year. That data, from a paper published in 2009, came from a survey of students at 70 colleges and universities. Meanwhile, the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University released a study based on data from 140 colleges and universities and 100,000 students for the 2013-14 year. Unlike other studies which reflect the overall student body, the Penn State study is based on data provided by students when they receive mental health services. It also reflects students who have made a suicide attempt within their lifetime -- not just the past year. Over this longer period, the study found, 9 percent of students had made a suicide attempt. Because this survey looked at a specific population that has received mental-health care, the rates will naturally be higher, said Ben Locke, executive director for the center. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not collected data on suicide attempts by colleges students specifically. However it does have emergency-department data on nonfatal suicide attempts by age. The rate for 20- to 24-year-olds in 2010 was about 300 per 100,000, while the rate for 15- to 19-year-olds was 381 per 100,000. That rate is a lot lower than the one Sanfilippo relied on. However, the use of emergency department visits doesn’t capture people who attempted suicide but didn’t then go to the hospital. "The actual number presented for care -- especially in an emergency department -- is going to be dramatically lower than people who self-disclose if they had an attempt in the last year," said Bill Schmitz, president of the American Association of Suicidology. For example, someone might have tried to overdose on Tylenol but then woke up without serious ill effects. Our ruling Sanfilippo said "200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses." That statistic is extrapolated from the American College Health Association’s most recent annual survey, which found that 1.2 percent of college and university students had attempted suicide within the past year. There are approximately 20 million students overall, which translates to about 200,000 suicide attempts. But the study’s author says there are two important caveats: their data is self-reported and the schools self-select to participate. In addition, a different type of survey conducted by the CDC -- one that looked at emergency data -- found a lower rate of suicide in similar age groups, but experts said that’s to be expected because emergency data doesn’t capture attempts that don’t lead to a hospital visit. On balance, we rate it Half True.	None	Marjorie Sanfilippo	None	None	None	2015-02-20T12:36:40	2015-02-16	['None']
pomt-06706	Says that when President Obama visited El Paso, he "pronounced that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/02/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-boasted-crimes-border-towns-/	At a Greenland, N.H., house party on Aug. 13, Texas Gov. Rick Perry answered questions ranging from illegal immigration to health care. Asked about the status of the U.S. border with Mexico, Perry challenged President Barack Obama’s claim about its safety: "We've got a President of the United States who came to El Paso some … 4 weeks ago and pronounced that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history." For this item, we're not evaluating whether the border is safer, but whether Perry is accurately characterizing what Obama said. To check that claim, we contacted Perry's campaign but got no reply. We checked White House records of the president’s schedule and found the El Paso trip was actually May 10, which was three months earlier, not four weeks. So Perry's timing is off. As for the president's remarks, they were focused on immigration reform and border issues. Obama said America is a "nation of immigrants," and welcomed "those willing to embrace America’s ideals and America’s precepts." But he said the country’s "broken" immigration system needs reform to ensure everyone achieves the "American Dream." Here's what he said about border safety: "Over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet (Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) and Alan (Bersin, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection) and everybody who's down here working at the border, we've answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. "The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It's a build-up that began under President Bush and that we've continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here. Referring to Republicans who had called for tougher border protections, he said, "They wanted a fence. Well, the fence is…The fence is now basically complete. "We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done. But even though we've answered these concerns, I've got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. "You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they're going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That's politics. "But the truth is the measures we've put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally. "And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn't accept any violence or crime. And we've always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it's not getting reported on." So did Obama actually say the border with Mexico and the United States is now "safer than it ever way in history"? Let's review Obama's words: He said there is more border enforcement than ever: "They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history." He said seizures and apprehensions are up: "Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago." He said violent crime is down: "Violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third." He said El Paso and other border cities are safe compared with other U.S. cities: "El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation." Perry is exaggerating. Obama did not actually "pronounce that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history." His time references were primarily for recent years. Still, Obama's tone and his examples definitely supported the overall point that the border is safer now than it was before. We rate Perry's claim Mostly True.

pomt-06047	On the accuracy of state jobs numbers.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/12/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-states-jobs-data-u/	The November jobs report, released Dec. 15, 2011by the state Department of Workforce Development, brought a mixture of disappointment and surprise. The disappointment was the news that the state lost 11,700 jobs in November, the worst monthly decline in more than two years. The surprise was how Gov. Scott Walker’s response: He attacked the figures as unreliable. Of course, this is the same monthly data Walker heralded in the first six months of his administration, when it showed job increases. In his campaign for governor, Walker’s top promise was that the state would add 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four year term. (We track progress each month on the Walk-O-Meter. The December numbers are due to be released January 26, 2012.) So, has Walker changed his view on the accuracy of the numbers? Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter and with it our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change in position is good politics or good policy, but simply whether a political figure has changed his or her position. The numbers are compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and released by the state agency. They are based on a survey of a sample of state employers and are routinely expressed as estimates. Each month, they are released as a preliminary number that is then "finalized" the next month. The state jobs tally started out in an encouraging fashion for Walker, beginning with the report on January 2011 job growth, issued on March 9, 2011, that showed the state added a total of 11,300 jobs that month. Walker took credit. "The number one goal of my Administration is to get government out of the way so that the private sector can create 250,000 jobs by 2015," Walker said. "Adding over 10,000 private sector jobs in January shows that Wisconsin is on the right track toward fulfilling that important goal." Manny Perez, then secretary of the Department of Workforce Development, said: "The numbers further reaffirm the importance of Gov. Walker’s approach to support policies that not only allow the private sector to create jobs in Wisconsin, but also accelerate job growth in our state." Perez urged job seekers to polish their resumes so they wouldn’t be left out in the hiring. "The economy is on the mend," he said. So, the administration clearly viewed the numbers as reliable and meaningful. Five months of job increases followed, concluding with a report for June, issued July 21, 2011, that showed another sharp increase, this time of 12,900 jobs. It was the largest single month increase in jobs since 2003. Instead of issuing a news release from the department secretary, Walker came to Milwaukee to highlight the release of the June report. The state was in the midst of unprecedented state Senate recall elections that could have cost Walker’s party control of that chamber. "To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state," Walker said. Workforce Development Secretary Scott Baumbach -- Walker’s second appointee to that post -- added that job-seekers and employers were "reaping the economic benefits of the business-friendly environment that Gov. Walker is advancing." At the time the June jobs report was issued, the reports had shown a net increase of 39,300 private-sector jobs. Then things changed. The July report said the state lost 12,500 jobs -- wiping out much of the gain reported for the previous month. In the months that followed, the administration reported small monthly job losses. Then on Dec. 15, 2011, the state report said Wisconsin lost 11,700 jobs in November, the steepest decline in more than two years. The administration didn’t comment about the factors that contributed to the jobs loss. Instead, for the first time, Walker’s team criticized the quality of the data gathered by the feds. Workforce development secretary Reggie Newson (Walker’s third appointee to the position) noted that the final October numbers had been revised from a loss of 9,300 jobs to a loss of only 1,400 -- a swing of 7,900. That monthly correction in the data was the largest this year -- an 85 percent change, compared an average correction of about 23 percent for the previous seven months of the year. We previously rated a statement by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that the monthly jobs numbers have a "margin of error of 75%" and were consistently "way off" Half True. Although there was a significant correction to the October data, there has been no change in the way the data is collected. The approach state has not changed since Walker took office. What’s the bottom line? Walker took credit for gains in state jobs for six months of 2011, as the monthly reports showed steady progress toward his promise of creating 250,000 jobs. In the second half of the year, the numbers began to decline and the governor’s approach shifted, with Walker in December criticizing the quality of the data. But nothing had changed in how the data was collected. Only Walker’s pronouncements on their accuracy. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-01165	"The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/11/nicholas-kristof/kristof-us-imprisons-blacks-rates-higher-south-afr/	The primary debate over race in this country seems to be whether the country needs to have a debate at all. Polls show white and black Americans have markedly different views of where the problems lie. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles called "When whites just don’t get it." Kristof applauded the progress in race equality America has achieved, but he basically argued that whites don’t know what life is like for blacks, and he presented many stats to show that great inequality remains. Comedy Central’s The Daily Show aired video of Kristof making his case Dec. 4. "The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did," Kristof said in the clip. Numbers on the American side are easier to come by and are straightforward. Kristof cited an Aspen Institute report that said, "The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid." The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that, in 2010, the incarceration rate for black men in all of the country’s jails and prisons was 4,347 people per 100,000. For whites, the rate was 678 people per 100,000. America imprisons people far more in general than comparable countries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, the United States is the clear leader with an incarceration rate about two and half times higher than the second place country, Chile. Precise numbers from South Africa during the apartheid years are more elusive. As a refresher, apartheid was South Africa’s policy of strict segregation and differential treatment of people according to their race. It became fully part of South African law in 1950 with passage of the Population Registration Act. That law dovetailed with other bills to anchor race-based controls. For instance, the Lands Act set aside about 87 percent of property for whites, and the Group Areas Act forbid nonwhites from living in white-designated zones. The 1950 legislation involved a set of "pass laws," so called because they created an internal passport system that supported the forced segregation. The apartheid era lasted more than 40 years, ending in 1991 with the repeal of the apartheid laws. William Worger, professor of history at the University of California-Los Angeles, is a longtime researcher of the apartheid era. Worger said the pass laws did much to fill the prisons. "Most of the arrests and imprisonment in South Africa were for pass laws offences," Worger told PunditFact. "The incarceration rate in South Africa in 1984 -- the midst of apartheid -- was 440 persons imprisoned per 100,000 population. Blacks comprised around 94 percent of those incarcerated." Based on Worger’s numbers, that would translate to an imprisonment rate of 612 per 100,000 for blacks in 1984. A report from the advocacy group The Sentencing Project found an incarceration rate of 851 black South Africans per 100,000 in 1993 (two years after the end of apartheid). The figure tracks back to a 1993 report of the South African Correctional Services. The report combined the categories of "black" and "colored" to produce the black male rate of incarceration. That’s two snapshots over a span of a decade, but it’s the best we have. In both cases, the numbers don’t begin to approach the current U.S. incarceration rate of African-American males. Whatever the limits in these data, the relative numbers for South Africa and the United States hold up, simply based on the number of beds in the South African prison system. In 1992, according to a report by University of Cape Town researchers, the country housed about 109,000 inmates in space designed for about 88,000. While overcrowding was known to have been worse before 1992, the black imprisonment rate could not have come close to today’s American rate simply due to limited room. There’s something of an international theme in countries comparing themselves to apartheid South Africa. We found Australian journalists drawing the same contrast relative to rates of imprisonment in their country. Our ruling Kristof said that America puts African-Americans behind bars at a higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. Based on the known evidence, that appears to be correct. In 2010, the black male incarceration rate in the United States was 4,347 people per 100,000 in the United States.

pomt-06241	Says his 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not "regressive."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/02/herman-cain/Cain-says-999-plan-not-regressive/	The recent debut of GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain’s "9-9-9 the Movie -- Slaying the Tax Monster" had PolitiFact Georgia waxing nostalgic over days gone by. Once upon a time -- about a month and a half ago -- Cain was surging to the top of the polls. He was the toast of the talk show circuit, and his 9-9-9 tax reform plan was the talk of the town. Cain repeated over and again that his plan was not "regressive." "[I]t is not regressive on the poor," he told the hosts of ABC’s "The View " Oct. 4. "It's not regressive," he told CNN Oct 13. "[T]hey try to say -- ‘Well, it’s going to be regressive on the poor.’ No, it’s not," he told a crowd in Las Vegas on Oct. 19. Cain’s "9-9-9 the Movie," a breezy five-minute cartoon released Monday, brings up the fate of the poor again. "Americans in lower tax brackets right now will have even more opportunities to move up as the economy takes off," it says. So, we wondered, is 9-9-9 "regressive"? There’s a bit of ideological dispute on what counts as a regressive tax. Some see it as one that taxes people at lower income levels at a higher rate than those who are wealthier. The Internal Revenue Service describes it as "a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups." And most economists agree that a regressive tax forces lower-earning taxpayers to pay a greater percentage of their income than higher earners. Some cite a national sales tax as an example. Because low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than higher-income households do, proportionally speaking, they have a greater tax burden. We looked at our past 9-9-9 coverage and other analysis. We found that while in most cases, personal tax rates will be the same regardless of how much money a person makes, it will change the lives of individuals on opposite ends of the income spectrum in very different ways. Our sister site PolitiFact National examined the plan. Based on the campaign’s statements, income tax exemptions will be for charitable deductions and "empowerment" zones that aim to encourage inner-city development. Cain’s 9 percent income tax would replace payroll taxes, which are paid by all workers toward Medicare and Social Security benefits. It would also end the estate tax. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to new goods, but not used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away. And if you’re like about half of the country and pay no income tax, there’s a good chance you’d start doing so under 9-9-9. An Oct. 18 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center offers perhaps the most detailed look at the plan. The group, which is made up of tax experts from Republican and Democratic administrations, found that Americans with top incomes would fare far better than the rest of us. Or, as Tax Policy Center analyst Howard Gleckman wrote, "Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan would result in a massive tax cut for nearly all of the highest-earning Americans and a steep average tax hike for everyone else." They looked at 9-9-9 based on income level and found nearly 84 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain’s plan, compared with current tax policy. More than 95 percent of those who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut. PolitiFact National posted data for filers who make $75,000 or less on its site. Now, there are a few caveats. After the Tax Policy Center released its analysis, Cain’s camp said households below the poverty level could claim a deduction. The center asked several times for more details on this deduction, but the campaign "did not define clearly how that deduction would work," they wrote. Their analysis therefore does not take into account this deduction. The center also had to fill in a few blanks about 9-9-9 to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change, but we found none so far. His cartoon says that 9-9-9 turns the entire country into an "opportunity zone," creates exemptions for people "starting at the poverty line," and creates incentives for "the most economically distressed areas." But beyond that, there are few additional details on his website or in any other statement we reviewed. Other analyses have come up with similar results as the Tax Policy Center. Before the Tax Policy Center released its results, PolitiFact Florida asked three tax accountants to take a look at a claim that under 9-9-9, taxes for filers that make $50,000 would fare better. They found the claim is only correct in certain instances and that Cain was cherry-picking his numbers. Bruce Bartlett was once a senior policy analyst to Ronald Reagan, but now is critical of the president’s approach to economics. He said that "The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut, with no guarantee that economic growth will increase and good reason to believe that the budget deficit will increase." Incidentally, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants did rough calculations for Yahoo News and concluded that billionaire business mogul Warren Buffett would likely pay no income taxes. We were unable to find any independent analysis that said 9-9-9 would have the same consequences for lower-income Americans as higher-income ones. Cain says the personal income flat tax is not "regressive," and technically speaking, all but the poor will be taxed at the same rate. (How he’ll handle the poor remains unclear.) Still, under Cain’s 9-9-9 plan, low- and middle-income taxpayers will pay a greater share of their income on taxes than their wealthier counterparts. This fits the definition of "regressive." We rate Cain’s claim False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-12-02T06:00:00	2011-10-19	['None']
pomt-13045	"We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/28/don-beyer/don-beyer-wrongly-says-us-has-surpluses-its-trade-/	U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, made a pitch for free-trade agreements early on election night, a few hours before Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race put those pacts in jeopardy. Beyer was interviewed by PJ Media, a conservative online news outlet and blog. If Democrat Hillary Clinton won the presidency, he was asked, what would Democrats do to gain the support of those who voted for Trump "specifically on the trade issue?" "First, I don’t think we can abandon our trade agenda," Beyer said. "We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20." Beyer offered a far rosier view of free-trade agreements than Trump, whose unrelenting criticism of them is credited with helping him to attract critical blue-collar votes. Trump says the agreements have encouraged U.S. manufacturers to move plants and jobs to countries that offer cheaper labor. He’s vowed to renegotiate - and possibly pull out of - the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And he promised not to enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim nations. So we wondered whether Beyer has it right when he says the U.S. has a surplus with all of its partners in existing trade deals. Uncle Sam, indeed, has trade agreements with 20 nations, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico and Canada, as we mentioned, are part of NAFTA, which became effective in 1994. Six nations joined the U.S. in 2004 in the Central American Free Trade Agreement: Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. has independent trade agreements with 12 nations: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru and Singapore. Census Bureau records show that during the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. was running overall trade deficits with seven of its agreement partners. Here are those nations and the U.S. negative trade balance with them: •Canada, $5.8 billion; •Colombia, $642 million; •Israel, $7 billion; •Jordan, $197 million; •South Korea, $22.8 billion; •Mexico, $46.8 billion; and •Nicaragua, $1.4 billion. When you add up the balances of all 20 nations with pacts, the U.S. was running a $54.5 billion trade deficit for the first nine months of this year. We examined the numbers for 2015 and found a similar result. The U.S. had trade deficits with six of the countries; only Colombia fell off the list. The U.S. had a composite $64 billion trade deficit with its 20 trade-agreement nations. All told, the U.S. ran up a $546 billion global trade deficit during the first nine months of this year and a $746 billion deficit in 2015. About half of the U.S. deficit both years came from its trade with China. We finally should note that we made two efforts to contact Beyer’s office for this article and did not get a reply. Our ruling Beyer said, "We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20." Data show the U.S. is running trade deficits with seven of those trade-agreement nations through the first nine months of this year and ran deficits with six of those countries in 2015. We rate Beyer’s statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8ac9b74e-f9ca-4ae8-aef6-520fc9ace048	None	Don Beyer	None	None	None	2016-11-28T00:00:00	2016-11-08	['None']
pomt-14982	"Paul Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/15/erick-erickson/paul-ryan-one-few-gop-house-members-have-voted-eve/	In the frenzy that followed the surprise decision by California Republican Kevin McCarthy to drop his bid for Speaker of the House, all eyes turned to Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan. And the knives came out. The left-wing website Salon slammed Ryan as too conservative, saying he "is just as much a wild-eyed right-wing nut as the rest of them, even if he can occasionally look a bit calmer on the TV." But even as it appeared that Ryan -- the Ways and Means chairman and 2012 GOP vice-presidential nominee -- was the consensus choice for speaker, he was attacked as not being conservative enough. Ryan "is a dangerous pick for conservatives," RedState.com editor-in-chief Erick Erickson wrote in a Oct. 9, 2015 blog post. "While in Congress, he voted for No Child Left Behind, the Prescription Drug Benefit, TARP, caps on CEO pay, the AIG bill, the GM bailout, the debt ceiling, and now the fiscal cliff. "In fact, Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Let's see if the bailout claim against Ryan -- who continues to be wooed, even though he has continued to say he's not going to run for speaker -- is on target. Ryan’s conservativeness Ryan is widely considered a conservative; indeed, he would be the most conservative House speaker in generations, as measured by a congressional rating system widely used by political scientists. Of course -- just like it is on the other end of the political spectrum -- there is right wing and then there is more right wing. Since 1971, the American Conservative Union has rated members of Congress based on legislation the group says is important. On a scale of zero to 100, Ryan, who has been in the House since 1999, has a lifetime rating of 90. On the other hand, his annual rating hit a career-low of 80 in 2011 and again in 2014. Meanwhile, the Conservative Review, headed by nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin, gives Ryan a "liberty score" of 58 percent on votes taken over the past six years -- a rating which it equates to a grade of F. Defining bailout It’s not clear from Erickson’s blog post what he regards as a bailout. He did not reply to our requests to provide information to back up his statement. Bailout, of course, is not a precise term. But there were at least three votes taken by the House on bailouts -- one on the giant bailout known as TARP, one on a separate measure for the auto industry, and one for the federal enterprises known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. TARP and the Freddie Mac and Fannie May rescues are the bailouts followed by Bailout Tracker, a feature of ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news site. 1. TARP In October 2008, the Democratically controlled Congress approved a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, primarily to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. It was aimed at rescuing banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. Later, a bailout of the auto industry also was part of TARP, primarily to Chrysler, General Motors and GM’s financial subsidiary, GMAC. (The total amount was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank law in 2010. About $245 billion went to banks and about $80 billion to the auto industry.) It’s worth noting that the measure, known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, was signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush. But it was also backed and continued by Bush’s Democratic successor, Barack Obama. TARP passed by a margin of 263-171 in the House. Ryan was among 91 Republicans who voted yes. Ryan’s vote earned him a demerit from the American Conservative Union. He said on the House floor at the time: "This bill offends my principles, but I’m going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system." 2. Auto bailout bill In December 2008, the House approved a related auto bailout bill by a vote of 237-170. Only a third as many Republican voted for the auto measure as voted for TARP. Ryan, whose district was home to a sprawling General Motors plant that closed the same month as the vote, was among 32 Republicans who voted yes. He said in a statement at the time that "because no additional taxpayer dollars were appropriated, I was able to support this legislation." By our tally, Ryan was one of 20 Republicans who voted for both TARP and the separate auto bailout measure, which did not become law. That's not less than a dozen, the figure Erickson used. But Ryan is among only five of the 20 who are still in the House. 3. Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae Freddie Mac (officially, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) are government-sponsored enterprises that help increase the money available for home loans. They were placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. Some $187.5 billion in federal funds have been invested in the two companies, according to ProPublica. Those funds were authorized by a law known as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which passed the House more than a year earlier, in August 2007. But Ryan voted against it. Before we close, we’ll note there was also a bailout of AIG, the insurance company, in 2008. But that $182 billion rescue was done with loans from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, not through an act of Congress. And Erickson’s claim was limited to those acted on by Congress. Our rating Erickson said Ryan "is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Ryan was one of 20 GOP House members who voted for TARP and for a related auto industry bailout measure that did not become law, although he is only one of only five of those members who are still in the House. On the other hand, Ryan voted against the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For a statement that contains an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-13100	"(Deborah) Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/05/senate-leadership-fund/did-deborah-ross-defend-right-burn-american-flag-a/	Deborah Ross, a former executive director of the North Carolina ACLU, has taken some flak for the positions that group took and legal decisions it made with her at the helm. Now that Ross, a Democrat, is running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, some of those past decisions are coming up in attack ads targeting her. One ad, released last month by the GOP group Senate Leadership Fund, attempts to paint Ross as unpatriotic. "Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag," the ad states. There are three parts to this claim, so we examined each one individually to see how accurate the ad is. Defended flag-burning The first part of the claim is that "Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag." In a way, this is both right and wrong, depending on how someone who hears the ad interprets it. Ross has defended people’s right to burn the flag, although she has said she does not defend the act itself. "Flag burning is plain wrong, and I’ll stand up for free speech – even speech I don’t like," she told McClatchy in an interview last month. Her stance is in keeping with nearly three decades of Supreme Court precedent that Americans cannot be punished by the government for burning the U.S. flag. Doing so is a valid form of protest and free speech that’s protected by the First Amendment, the court ruled in its 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. That 5-4 decision came about in large part thanks to conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who was the swing vote. The 1989 case applied only to Texas, but in 1990 Congress passed a law banning flag-burning – and the Supreme Court then struck it down as unconstitutional, applying the standard nationwide. So Ross did defend flag-burning, taking the side of the Supreme Court. Derided efforts to ban flag-burning Next is the claim that Ross called attempts to ban flag-burning "ridiculous." Seeing as she sided with the Supreme Court precedent on defending flag-burning, it’s not too surprising that this part of the claim is correct as well. "We have a First Amendment right to burn the flag as symbolic speech," Ross said in 1995, while leading the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, regarding a proposal to circumvent the Supreme Court rulings by passing a new constitutional amendment. "The Constitution protects that right. To spend time and effort on this is ridiculous." Refused to help a veteran This is the part that gets tricky. In 2001, a veteran living in Caldwell County wrote the North Carolina ACLU for help in a neighborhood dispute. Robert McClure, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, had been flying an American flag at his home. But the company that owned the mobile home park where he lived asked him to take it down; a neighborhood covenant said that, among other rules, flag poles weren’t allowed. McClure wrote to the ACLU asking for a lawyer to fight the company and win him the right to fly the flag. The ACLU declined. Ross didn’t personally write the letter declining to take his case, but she was the boss at the time, so the claim seems to be accurate on its face. However, it ignores a few key facts. The Constitution protects people from the government infringing on their rights. It doesn’t apply to interactions with private companies. That’s why you don’t have a First Amendment right to cuss out your boss, and why businesses are allowed to ban firearms on their premises. And McClure was not just trying to bring a constitutional claim against a private company. According to the company, he had actually agreed to the covenants that banned flag poles when he purchased his property. The letter from the ACLU turning him down said that the group received more requests every year than it could possibly handle, and thus "we can offer legal assistance in only a small number of cases with the maximum possibility of success." According to news reports, the veteran’s dispute was nevertheless settled quickly, and he was allowed to fly the flag. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund’s anti-Ross ad said she "defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag." The first part of the claim, about defending flag-burning, is a bit vague. Ross has said she does not support the act of flag-burning but does defend people’s right to do so. The ad is right that she said it was ridiculous to try to ban flag-burning. But where the ad diverges further from the truth is on the matter of the ACLU declining to represent a veteran when Ross was in charge. While technically correct, the group refused because the man was attempting to bring a claim that was not the type of legal battle the ACLU typically fights. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08455	Says Tom Ganley has been "sued over 400 times, for fraud, discrimination and more," and "a judge called Tom Ganley's business practices "deceptive and unconscionable."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/15/betty-sutton/rep-betty-sutton-cries-buyer-beware-ad-against-gop/	Tom Ganley's success in selling cars helped make him Ohio's largest dealer. It made him rich enough to put more than $3.4 million into financing his Republican congressional campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District. Sutton has less than a quarter of his war chest. She and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are countering by challenging the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire. Sutton’s TV ad "Buyer," posted on YouTube Sept. 21, uses the theme "buyer beware" and says: Ganley has been "sued over 400 times, for fraud, discrimination and more." A judge called Tom Ganley's business practices "deceptive" and "unconscionable." Sutton makes the claim that Ganley is a "dishonest car sales­man." That’s a statement of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can’t rate. But we can check her numbers and try to put them in perspective. We did find that Ganley was named in well over 400 suits in Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit counties, dating back to 1979. That number, though, when weighted for volume and time in operation, appeared to be comparable with the record of four other large auto groups we examined. A Plain Dealer story before last spring’s primary election reported that Ganley dealerships face suits from employees for age, racial and sex discrimination. Ganley’s campaign characterized them as disgruntled employees. Many of the dozens of lawsuits from customers were filed under the Ohio Lemon Law. Lemon Law cases involve manufacturing and repair problems and do not necessarily reflect on the way a dealer does business. But most Lemon Law cases are filed against dealers, in addition to manufacturers, though the law does not require it. Ganley dealerships have been sued for selling damaged cars as new and lending a potential buyer a car that had been reported stolen. Some of the consumer lawsuits involve the dealer practice of offering a "conditional delivery agreement" or "spot delivery agreement," which permits a consumer to take a new vehicle home before financing has been approved. Buyers Jeffrey and Stacy Felix claim they took home a new SUV, at Ganley’s insistence, after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent. Their suit, and others, additionally claimed that Ganley violated Ohio's Consumer Sales Practices Act with a purchase contract containing a mandatory arbitration clause. That clause required any dispute between the buyer and dealer to be resolved by binding arbitration. The judge in Felix vs. Ganley Chevrolet, agreed that the clause was misleading, unfair and deceptive enough to be classified under Ohio law as "unconscionable," and therefore unenforceable. Ganley’s campaign spokeswoman Meghan Snyder noted -- accurately -- that Ganley or Ganley Automotive was named as the plaintiff and not the defendant in some suits. She said that "90 cases were dismissed without prejudice," and that 98 of the cases against Ganley also named a manufacturer and related to the Ohio Lemon Law. "Over his 42 years in business, Mr. Ganley has sold 585,211 cars, served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, and had a total of 5,486 employees," Snyder said. "He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades." We repeat: We are not rating the ad’s statement about Ganley’s honesty. But Sutton’s claim that he has been "sued over 400 times" and that a judge described his business practices "deceptive and unconscionable" checks out. Recognizing that he has been in business more than four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer are additional pieces of information not in the ad that help put the numbers into perspective. We rate her ad claim as Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2010-10-15T06:00:00	2010-09-21	['None']
pomt-03623	"Pentagon confirms they may court martial soldiers who hold Christian faith."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/06/blog-posting/bloggers-say-pentagon-may-court-martial-christian-/	No more military chaplains? Soldiers court-martialed for their Christian faith? PolitiFact readers wanted to know if headlines across websites such as Breitbart.com and MrConservative.com last week were true. "Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith," said Breitbart.com, claiming that "the Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted." It could "effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military," the post said. "Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith," said MrConservative.com, explaining that "the Pentagon has released an official statement affirming that it will court martial 'proselytization.’" So, did the Pentagon confirm it might "court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith"? Welcome to the latest battle for soldiers’ hearts and minds. Pentagon meeting The recent hubbub has roots in the early 2000s, when a man named Mikey Weinstein watched his sons follow in his footsteps at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The Jewish students both faced Christian proselytizing, the family says, and in some cases, anti-Semitic slurs. An Air Force task force investigated accusations that the academy created a discriminatory climate, after a 2004 survey showed cadets complained that evangelical Christians had pressured Jews and other Christians. It found a need for policy guidance for commanders and supervisors regarding religious expression, not just at the academy, but across the Air Force. In 2005, Weinstein — a former Air Force attorney who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration — unsuccessfully sued the Air Force for failing to prevent proselytizing. In 2006, he turned his attention full-time to his nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, saying he was fighting off "far-right militant radical evangelical religious fundamentalists." (He also writes about "fundamentalist Christian monsters" who unite around "horrific hatred and blinding bigotry," which doesn’t exactly endear him to groups he targets, such as the Family Research Council.) Fast-forward to a Washington Post blog in late April. Sally Quinn, who writes about religion for the Washington Post's On Faith blog, spoke with Weinstein and others on their way to meet with "several generals and a military chaplain." Weinstein had asked for months for the April 23 sit-down, which included his board members Larry Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and Joe Wilson, a former ambassador. The three planned to exhort the military to punish proselytizing. They pointed Quinn to examples such as a chaplain telling troops — including Afghan soldiers — to "get right with Jesus," Marine officers changing the name of their attack squadron to the "Crusaders" (Weinstein’s group got them to change it back) and a military contractor putting references to the New Testament on gun sights (again, Weinstein fought to have them removed). "It’s a workplace violation," Wilson said. "This is a national security threat," Weinstein said. Weinstein also got an officer to remove an atheist bumper sticker from his car because it bothered an evangelical Christian. But, the men argued, the military itself needed to do more to protect troops who feel their religious freedom is undermined. Quinn quoted Wilson: "You need half a dozen court-martials real quick." Quinn’s post, published Friday, April 26, caught the attention of Fox News Radio commentator Todd Starnes. Monday, April 29, he asked the Pentagon: Is there a plan to court-martial chaplains who proselytize? Here’s what the Defense Department spokesman Nate Christensen told him: "The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. "Court martials and non-judicial punishment are decided on case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases. "However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense." Starnes wrote: The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that Christian evangelism is against regulations. "Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense, LCDR Nate Christensen said in a written statement. He declined to say if any chaplains or service members had been prosecuted for such an offense. "Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases," he said. The Internet took over from there. Weinstein had been "hired by the Pentagon" to "help shape policy on … religious tolerance," said Investor’s Business Daily. (Not true.) President Barack Obama’s Defense Department was "promising to bring criminal charges against any military personnel who express or share their faith," said a PA Pundits blogger. (Also not true.) And an anonymous blogger at MrConservative.com, citing Breitbart.com, declared, "Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith." PolitiFact reached out to Nate Christensen at the Defense Department, who said his statement "was grossly taken out of context." On May 2, he clarified: "Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization). "If a service member harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. "... We work to ensure that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right to practice their religion in a manner that is respectful of other individuals' rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from accomplishing the military mission." Weinstein, he said, wasn’t part of any Defense Department advisory group or committee, nor was he a consultant on religious issues. ‘There’s a line there’ The military has grappled for years with how to balance the rights of people exercising different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. Weinstein’s group had urged the Pentagon to enforce a recent Air Force policy on "government neutrality regarding religion." He wants to see courts-martial under the Uniform Military Code of Justice’s Article 92, "Failure to Obey Order or Regulation," for those who don’t follow orders not to proselytize. Rules in place since last year say that Air Force leaders "must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion." Meanwhile, "all airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from your own." Rules for military chaplains already reflect this tightrope act. They’re affiliated with outside religious organizations, but must support troops of all faiths. "They're very careful about how they offer advice," said Lori Bogle, an associate history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who writes about religion and the military. "They are more like counselors. And if a person expresses a religious interest, they might go there." That’s been the general policy as long as she knows — even back to the 1940s. But in times of "stress," the military has briefly embraced evangelism, such as during the early Cold War, when "character guidance" programs and seminars took on an overtly Christian cast in response to an atheist enemy. But that stopped by the mid 1960s, she said. So, it’s not necessarily new or surprising the Pentagon would say proselytizing isn’t permitted. But groups such as the Family Research Council argue the policy outlined by the Defense Department spokesman last week is "incoherent," asking how the military will distinguish between "evangelizing" and "proselytizing." It has launched a petition to urge the defense secretary from censoring "the full solace of the gospel." Meanwhile, a Coast Guard rear admiral, William Lee, spoke last week of his discomfort with current rules — he wants to be able to hand Bibles to suicidal servicemen. Ken Klukowski, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, says millions of Christians, including "evangelicals, devout Catholics and observant Mormons," believe they are required by the New Testament to share their faith with others. "This is to be done respectfully and peacefully, at appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, but it must be done when such opportunities present themselves," he wrote. "To say that sharing the gospel is a crime under military law … is to say that tens of millions of Americans are not allowed to serve in our military." So, to some, to "hold Christian faith" is synonymous with promoting that faith to co-workers and subordinates. Under that interpretation, they could theoretically face court-martial if others found their attempts intrusive or harassing. But so far, Weinstein’s urging hasn’t resulted in such a court-martial. Our ruling Recent headlines and articles offered versions of the claim that the "Pentagon confirms they may court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith." Instead, a Defense Department spokesman had explained that proselytizing — "unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others" — wasn’t permitted and that punishment for breaking military rules is decided "case by case." Conservative religious groups argue this means "sharing the gospel" would become a crime. But no policy we saw suggests that the Pentagon would court-martial soldiers "who hold Christian faith." Quite the opposite — much of the language from the Defense Department reinforces the right of military members to practice their religion, as long as it’s in a way that respects others’ belief systems. Chaplains already follow such rules. Still, there’s a sliver of truth — if you believe your Christian faith compels you to try to convert others in a way people find harassing, it’s possible you could face court-martial, though such a thing has yet to happen. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-05-06T16:35:49	2013-05-01	['None']
pomt-05470	"The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-annual-new-business-startups-have/	When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island April 11 to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he said that President Obama’s policies were hurting the economy. To demonstrate that point during his speech in Warwick, Romney pointed to the rate of new business start-ups around the nation. "The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term," Romney said. Romney has made this claim in other speeches. In Colorado in February, he was more detailed, saying, "Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before." Start-up businesses are a crucial part of the nation’s economy. One recent study found that they account for only 3 percent of employment but almost 20 percent of gross job creation. So it stands to reason that one explanation for the slow pace of recovery is a lack of start-up activity. In that context, we were interested to see if Romney’s claim was accurate. A spokeswoman for Romney’s campaign refused to comment for this piece, so we did our own research. We started with an item written March 23, 2010, by our friends at PolitiFact Ohio checking a claim by House Speaker John Boehner that "new business start-ups are at the lowest levels in 30 years." Boehner’s statement was rated True, because the rate of start-ups per thousand people and the total number of start-ups per year were lower than in 1977 -- the date cited by Boehner’s office. But that item was not directly attributing the rate to Obama, as Romney did. We called Scott Shane, an expert on entrepreneurship who was a source for the PolitiFact Ohio Item. Shane is chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He sent us a spreadsheet of Census Bureau data compiled by the U.S. Small Business Administration. His chart included the number of new firms created annually from 2005 to 2009, the most recent year that data is available. The number of new firms increased from 2005 to 2006 but fell steadily each year afterward, going from 556,899 in 2006 to 403,765 in 2009. The difference between 2008 -- George W. Bush’s last year in office -- and 2009 -- Obama’s first year -- was 84,499 fewer new businesses. Although it’s close, that’s not the drop-off of 100,000 new businesses that Romney claimed in his statement. But the available SBA data doesn’t cover Obama’s subsequent years in office, so it’s impossible to use it to make a conclusive ruling on Romney’s claim. So we turned to another source of information that has data for more recent years -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for labor figures. The bureau also tracks the creation of new businesses, but its numbers are different from the SBA data. While the SBA only includes start-ups, the BLS includes all new establishments. As Shane explained, if McDonald’s opens a new branch somewhere, then that branch is included in the BLS numbers but not in the SBA numbers. So the more-inclusive BLS number is generally larger than the SBA number for any given year. Although the BLS number doesn’t correlate perfectly to the number of new start-up businesses, we believe it’s still relevant. Romney’s claim was made as a part of a broader criticism of Obama’s economic policies and the slow rate of recovery. Whether a new establishment is a completely new business or a branch of an existing one, it still creates jobs and contributes to economic growth. According to the bureau’s Business Employment Dynamics statistics, the number of new establishments rose until 2006, when it was 667,341. It fell every year afterward up to 2010 by an average of 40,053 -- but then rose again in 2011 by 29,316. Despite the recent increase, however, the overall decrease since Obama became president is close to 100,000. In 2008, the number of new establishments was 626,771. In 2011, it was 536,445 -- 90,326 less. Because Romney’s campaign would not give us a source for his claim, we can only make an educated guess that he used the BLS number and rounded it up to 100,000. That may be reasonable, but there are still problems with Romney’s statement. By saying that the number of new businesses dropped during "this president’s term," he is clearly implying that Obama is responsible. Later in the speech he gave in Warwick, Romney was more emphatic. "This has not been a good time to start new enterprises," he said. "This president’s policies are responsible for the fact that this recovery has been postponed..." In a past speech, Romney called Obama’s presidency a "war on enterprise." At PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible. But the number of new business start-ups had been declining before Obama took office. The numbers tracked by both the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were down in 2007 and 2008, President George W. Bush’s last two years in office. The trend continued under President Obama. The decline coincided with the onset of the global economic recession. Not surprisingly, the biggest year-on-year drop-off in new businesses -- 17 percent according to the SBA and 12.5 percent according to the BLS -- occurred from 2008 to 2009, when the recession was at its worst. Obama took office in January 2009. In general, because of the complexities involved, PolitiFact has been leery of attributing the health of the economy to the policies of a president. We’ll borrow a quote from a recent PolitiFact National item to explain. "A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new office holder," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. (Burtless has provided advice to the campaign of Republican John McCain and contributed money to Obama.) "The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office." So what are some reasons for the drop in new business start-ups? In testimony to the House Committee on Small Business, Martin Neil Baily, another economist at Brookings, said that a reduction in home equity -- an important source of funds for start-ups -- and a tightening of banks’ lending standards are partly to blame. It’s important to note that the recession didn’t just affect start-ups in the United States. A 2010 World Bank study of 95 countries found that "nearly all experienced a sharp drop in business entry during the crisis." We should also add that it is extremely difficult to accurately measure the rate of business start-ups. We found one study that showed entrepreneurship rising in 2009 before falling in subsequent years. Another showed the rate rising in 2009 and 2010 before falling last year. "No single measure captures entrepreneurial activity perfectly," Shane wrote in a commentary last year. Finally, it’s telling that in 2011, as the United States started moving toward a recovery, the rate of new establishments tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased for the first time since 2006. Romney didn’t mention that in his speech. Our ruling Mitt Romney said: "The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term." Many studies have found that fewer businesses have been created during the recession than in previous years. But we couldn’t find any that attributed a drop-off to Obama’s policies or, for that matter, Bush’s policies. There is some truth in Romney’s claim, but he neglected to say that the rate of new business start-ups was dropping before Obama took office. Or that by one measurement it has increased recently. Because Romney "leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rate his statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11307	"Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!"	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/18/scott-walker/record-low-unemployment-and-record-high-number-peo/	Two favorite boasts of Republican Scott Walker in his bid for a third term as governor are about unemployment and the number of people working in Wisconsin. He doubled down in this April 4, 2018 tweet, declaring: Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH! We’ll check the two statistics. But more importantly, as voters begin to ponder the November 2018 election, we’ll also examine Walker’s insistence that both are due to his reforms. The figures Wisconsin’s estimated unemployment rate dipped to 2.9 percent in February 2018, the lowest ever, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, citing the latest figures available when Walker posted his tweet. The article noted that the figures came from a state Department of Workforce Development report that was based on preliminary estimates from a monthly survey with sparse sample sizes and was subject to revision. The same Journal Sentinel article reported that in February 2018, the state also set a record for the total number of people employed, with 3.07 million. It’s worth noting that when Walker previously claimed, in June 2016, that more people were employed in Wisconsin than ever before, we rated his statement Mostly True, noting it didn’t take into account population growth. Now to the role of Walker’s reforms. Walker’s argument Walker’s campaign cited a number of policies that it links to the two statistics, including these. Tax, regulation cuts: In 2015, roughly midway into Walker’s time as governor, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Noah Williams credited Walker’s reductions in taxes and regulations for the favorable unemployment labor participation rates. Williams was described at the time as an informal adviser to Walker’s 2016 presidential campaign. Manufacturing/agriculture credit: An April 2017 study by the same economist argued that the credit, which took effect in 2013, has "accounted for a total gain" of 42,000 jobs. Food stamp change: More than 25,000 people, according to Walker’s Department of Health Services, gained employment after completing job training that was required under new rules imposed by the Walker administration. To be sure, Wisconsin hasn’t always had high marks during Walker’s tenure. In comparison to other states, Wisconsin hasn’t fared well in rankings for job creation and new business creation. And the job growth wasn’t enough to meet Walker’s promise to create 250,000 jobs during his first term. A governor’s limited role As we’ve noted repeatedly in previous fact checks, the economy is affected by many factors, including national ones, and a governor plays an important -- but only limited -- role in a state’s economy. Marquette University economics professor James McGibany reiterated that to us in assessing Walker’s claim. McGibany said it’s very difficult to tease out how many jobs were created solely because of a policy change, or changes. For example, he said some of the increase in Wisconsin manufacturing jobs during Walker’s tenure is likely due to the overall economy recovering from the 2008-’09 recession. Similarly, some people who had been on food stamps and later found work likely did so because of the overall improvement in the economy, not specifically because of job training requirements. Moreover, McGibany said, low unemployment and high labor participation are being seen in most of the Midwest, including in states governed by Democrats as well as Republicans. "The point is," he said, "what is going on in Wisconsin is not the exception, but the rule for most of our neighboring states." Indeed, even Walker himself has acknowledged there are multiple factors at work. For example, when asked about a week before his tweet why Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is so low, he said it is "a combination of things -- the biggest thanks for that are to the hard-working employers of the state, because I understand that government doesn’t create jobs, people do … what we did was help create a better business climate." Our rating Walker says: "Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!" Walker is correct on the two statistics. But his various reforms can only be considered to be a contributing factor, at most, given many factors that affect the state’s economy. We rate Walker’s statement Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-04-18T06:00:00	2018-04-04	['None']
pomt-07839	Says Milwaukee County elected officials drive around in luxury cars "on your dime."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/14/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/	A major theme of philanthropist Chris Abele’s campaign for Milwaukee County executive has been a promise to crack down on the perks of taxpayer-paid cell phones and cars by "politicians and bureaucrats." The candidate has repeated the pledge in a television ad and -- most prominently -- in a direct mail piece to voters. That piece features two large photos of a Lincoln Town Car, bearing the license plate "U-PAY", parked in front of the county courthouse. The words above the cover photo: "They’re driving on your dime." Inside, there is this statement: "Milwaukee County politicians and bureaucrats think they can drive and run up cell phone bills on your dime while our county suffers. I don’t. It’s time to cut the perks and change business as usual." That statement is presented as a direct quote from Abele. To underline the pledge, Abele’s name is listed below it (albeit with his first name misspelled). With the direct mail piece coming on top of the ad, it got us wondering about the perks, especially the snazzy cars. (A second piece echoes the first, but features a cell phone with the words "They are dialing on your dime.") Just how many politicians are driving around in them? We asked Abele spokesman Brandon Lorenz which officials have their car on the chopping block. "The county executive has a car," said Lorenz. "If elected, Chris will cut it." He’s referring to a 2006 Chevy Impala that’s kept at the Courthouse Annex for use by the county executive. Latest records show it has about 23,000 miles on it. Under former County Executive Scott Walker, now the governor, some 2,032 miles were put on it from June of 2009 to June of 2010. How much is it worth? Edmunds.com, a car pricing service, pegs the trade-in value of that make and model at $9,400 -- assuming it’s in good condition and has a better than average option package. But what about all the other cars? After all, the ad and fliers suggest there is plenty of money to be saved by cutting them. We located a Nov. 19, 2010 report to the County Board that lists all county passenger vehicles used by employees, other than those within the Sheriff’s Department. Aside from the county executive’s car, the only other one for an elected official on the list is a 2003 Ford Crown Victoria assigned to the district attorney. The DA is allowed to keep the Crown Vic -- another model frequently used as a squad car -- at his home to respond to crime scenes. The list also includes a variety of delivery vans, SUVs and so forth, including about 10 vehicles that workers use to cart critters around at the zoo. No Lincoln Town Cars were listed. At Milwaukee City Hall, aldermen receive a monthly "car allowance." But county supervisors (as well as judges, and most other elected county officials) receive no such perk. Let’s complete our visit to the motor pool. Abele has promised to slash perks enjoyed by county politicians and bureaucrats. Outside of the Sheriff’s Department, two elected officials have county-funded cars; one, the top prosecutor, has his for emergency use and is not targeted by Abele.That narrows Abele’s car-cutting target to one vehicle: a five year old Impala that’s worth less than $10,000. That’s a drop in the billion dollar budget. There’s a bit of truth here … Of the more than 75 county elected officials, at least two have access to a car that’s paid for by taxpayers. But the argument Abele is making -- that he’ll cut lavish perks to save hardworking taxpayers a bunch of money -- comes up flat. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08423	"Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle class tax cuts. And said unemployment’s not that big an issue."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/19/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-attacks-mark-kirk-oon-issue-tax-/	In the Illinois Senate race between Democrat Alexi Giannoulias and five-term Republican Congressman Mark Kirk, negative attacks have been flying from the get-go. The intensity and frequency of those attacks has only increased as the election moves into the home stretch. In his latest ad called "My Left Foot," Giannoulias makes three quick claims about his opponent, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk. According to the voice-over, "Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle-class tax cuts. And said unemployment’s not that big an issue." The ad then features a parade of man-on-the-street comments disparaging Kirk, ending with a woman who says of Kirk, "I would not trust him with my left shoe." So that's how the ad got its name. We'll go over each of the claims in order. "Mark Kirk lied about going to war." Mark Kirk's misstatements about his military record have been a campaign issue for months. Kirk has admitted to being "careless" with facts about his military record on a number of occasions, and we have checked several of them out at PolitiFact. But it's also true that Kirk has had a fairly distinguished military record. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer and currently holds the rank of commander. In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his "phenomenal performance" and described Kirk as "a natural and charismatic leader" and "head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met." Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009. According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. But Kirk first drew scrutiny when he claimed he was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year. It turns out he didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet. Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the "Intelligence Officer of the Year." "Most importantly, I wasn't thinking," Kirk said in a press conference. "This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me." At other times, Kirk and his campaign literature have described him as "a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom." He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served "during" the operations. His service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions. Giannoulias also has repeatedly criticized Kirk for once claiming, "The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying, and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us." In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country. In a June 4, 2010, interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified "that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo." "I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details," Kirk told the Sun-Times. "And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize." Okay, but what about the claim in the latest Giannoulias ad, that Kirk "lied about going to war." In the background, an out-of-focus Mark Kirk appears to be saluting a crowd. On the screen, it states, "Mark Kirk 'lied' about going to war" and sources it to a June 2, 2010, story in Newsweek. We checked out the Newsweek story and it does, indeed, allege that Kirk "lied." But the story doesn't claim Kirk lied "about going to war." Rather, it calls Kirk out for "explicitly, officially, and falsely claiming to have won the U.S. Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year award for service during NATO's conflict with Serbia." Misspeaking about an award you won is different that lying about going to war (a la Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat running for the Senate in Connecticut, who repeatedly said he served "in Vietnam" instead of "during Vietnam"). One could make a strong case that Kirk has been too loose with the facts about having served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- he did two two-week training stints in Afghanistan -- but he has served during combat, in Kosovo. More importantly, when the ad puts "lied" in quotes, and prominently cites a specific Newsweek story, the implication is that the story claims -- as the ad says -- that Kirk "lied about going to war." The article says Kirk lied about being the Intelligence Officer of the year. That's different. And so we rate the claim Barely True. The second claim in the ad is that Kirk "opposed middle-class tax cuts." In case you missed the small print in the ad, it reads "Vote 70, Feb. 13, 2009." What is Vote 70 in the 111th Congress? The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aka the economic stimulus package. Republicans criticizing the stimulus often ignore the fact that nearly a third of it -- $288 billion -- was for various tax cuts. And one of the biggest tax cuts was aimed squarely at the middle class. The Making Work Pay provision provided a refundable credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010. Making Work Pay was estimated to benefit about 110 million working Americans -- most of them middle class -- at a cost of about $116 billion. And Kirk voted against the stimulus. So does that mean Kirk opposed middle-class tax cuts? We think that's misleading. The stimulus was, of course, not just an up or down vote on Making Work Pay tax credits. The Making Work Pay tax credits made up less than a fifth of the overall, $787 billion cost of the massive economic stimulus bill, which included $275 billion on spending projects such as new roads, bridges and high-speed rail and $224 billion worth of payments to state governments for things such as hiring teachers and police officers and for services such as extended unemployment insurance and health coverage. On Kirk's campaign website, it notes that "Congressman Kirk voted against the stimulus because it wasted money on big government spending programs." The campaign website also claims Kirk has voted to cut taxes more than 40 times. We're not going to get into all those votes, but there's no evidence that Kirk opposed the middle-class tax cuts; he opposed the overall stimulus. And so we rate this claim Barely True. Last is the claim that Kirk "said unemployment’s not that big an issue." That seems an odd claim given that Kirk has a whole section in the "Issues" section of his campaign website called "Getting Illinois Working Again." The page outlines Kirk's philosophy of lowering taxes, reducing borrowing and investing in things like alternative energy to "spur job creation." Agree or not with his ideas, the positions suggest that Kirk believes unemployment is a serious issue. So where does the Giannoulias ad's claim come from? The print in the background of the ad states, "Mark Kirk: Unemployment is not a 'big issue'." And then in small print, the ad sources a Roll Call story on June 16, 2008. The story was about a battle between Democrats and Republicans over a plan to extend unemployment benefits. Although the bill received some Republican support -- particularly from GOP senators in states hardest-hit by unemployment -- the plan was opposed by the Republican leadership and enough rank-and-file Republicans so that the bill did not have enough votes to override a veto from then President George W. Bush. Republican leaders said they favored an extension of unemployment benefits only in states with high unemployment and only for people who had worked for at least 20 weeks before being laid off. Here's the part of the Roll Call story that includes Kirk, who opposed the Democrats' plan: "I want to make sure that when you get extended unemployment benefits, you've been working for more than two weeks," he said. Kirk said the issue just isn't that big a deal in his district, where he said the unemployment rate is about 5.5 percent -- the same as the national rate. "I know that others think this is a big issue, but I've heard very little," he said. "I have a very high-income district." On its website, the Kirk campaign responded to a similar claim made by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- that Kirk had callously claimed unemployment wasn't a big issue -- by pointing out that the article is more than two years old, and that the comment came when unemployment stood at 5.5 percent (it's now at 9.6 percent). The Kirk campaign also noted that Kirk voted to extend unemployment benefits numerous times between 2002 and 2010, and "Mark Kirk has said he would vote to extend unemployment benefits again if the legislation did not add to the debt or raise taxes." This past July, however, Kirk again voted against a bill to extend unemployment benefits, saying, "I opposed the last one because there was no effort to offset the cost. It just added $30 billion straight to the deficit." The Giannoulias campaign contends Kirk's comment in Roll Call was that unemployment isn't a big issue, but we think the fuller context of the article makes clear that Kirk is saying that extending unemployment benefits -- at that time -- was not "that big a deal" in his district. That's different than saying unemployment is not a big deal. We rate the claim Barely True. And that's how we rate the ad overall -- Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02460	"Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/24/matt-bevin/republican-challenger-matt-bevin-attacks-senate-mi/	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may have the backing of the National Rifle Association in his quest for a sixth term as Kentucky’s U.S. Senator, but his Republican primary opponent insists McConnell is weak on Second Amendment issues. Businessman Matt Bevin released a 15-second TV ad on Feb. 19, 2014, that not only attacked McConnell’s record on guns, but claimed McConnell’s positions were closely aligned with his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. "Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights," the ad said. "Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear." We were surprised to see McConnell attacked on his support of the Second Amendment, having just won the "Defender of Freedom" award from the NRA. So we took a deeper dive into this ad to see what it’s getting at. Dissecting the 1991 crime bill The ad isn’t referencing the gun debate of the last two years — or even of the last two decades. Instead, Bevin’s campaign points to a Senate vote from 1991, when McConnell was just starting his second term in office, to support the claim. Back then, President George H.W. Bush sent an anti-crime bill to Congress that would "toughen a number of laws to cover more violent crimes and would impose the death penalty for certain federal offenses," according to a Boston Globe report from the time. Democrats, who controlled both chambers of Congress, were critical of the bill for not addressing ownership of assault weapons and other gun control measures. And though Bush called for the bill to be passed within 100 days, a contentious showdown ensued. The Senate version of the bill, called the Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 and proposed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., included an assault weapons ban from the outset and a seven-day waiting period to purchase handguns. The sprawling bill also sent $1 billion to local law enforcement agencies and courts, and expanded mandatory minimum sentencing and use of the death penalty. Senators filed hundreds of amendments to the legislation. Two of the most controversial dealt with gun ownership. A compromise measure shrunk the waiting period to purchase a handgun to five days and laid out parameters for a speedy federal background check. It passed with significant Republican support. But not from McConnell, who opposed any wait period on background checks, his campaign said. The Kentucky senator joined 23 Republicans and eight Democrats to vote against the five-day waiting period. (Reid voted for the measure). The other notable amendment was an NRA-backed measure that would have completely eliminated the waiting period to buy handguns. Before the vote, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a proponent of the amendment, told his colleagues, "Everybody here better understand this is the key vote" that will tell whether "you're either for or against the Second Amendment right to buy arms." McConnell voted for the NRA’s amendment. Reid did as well. But it did not pass, only mustering 44 votes. The vote that Bevin’s ad singled out was neither of those, but a vote on final passage of the Senate version of the omnibus crime bill, which passed 71-36. McConnell joined Reid in voting for the measure. McConnell also voted to invoke cloture and end debate on the bill earlier in the day. McConnell’s campaign said he only backed the bill because he supported the tougher sentences and money for local police, and to push the bill into a conference committee with the House, where he hoped the gun measures would be removed. Bevin’s campaign said that "is the classic Washington way of pretending you are against something in your state, but support the measure in Washington" and he should have worked to defeat the measure entirely. Killing the bill But in fact, McConnell did work to defeat the final bill. Though the Senate crime bill had support from President Bush, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree to a comprehensive measure in the conference committee. Instead, the Democratic majority forced through a bill that had less bipartisan support. The conference bill passed the House by two votes but stalled in the Senate for the rest of 1991 and 1992 under the threat of veto from Bush. With a filibuster in place, Senate Democrats couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, despite three attempts, in part because the compromise bill had tighter gun restrictions. All three times the bill came up for a cloture vote to end debate, McConnell voted against it. Reid, however, voted to invoke cloture twice and once did not vote at all. So that was 1991. In 2013, McConnell held his caucus firmly together against attempts to restrict and regulate gun purchases after the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting at Newtown. The Senate failed to reach the 60 votes needed on measures to expand background checks on gun purchases, to ban assault weapons and to restrict high capacity magazines. McConnell voted no each time and under his stewardship, Republicans blocked the bills from passing. Reid voted in favor of the assault weapon and high capacity magazine bans. He voted against the expanded background checks, a procedural move that allowed him to bring the amendment up for vote again in the future. Our ruling Bevin’s ad says "Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights." The ad focuses on a vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of votes and amendments and didn’t even pass Congress. The law failed, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. On amendments, McConnell sided with firearm lobbyists when a closely watched provision came up for a vote. The only evidence the Bevin campaign offered was that McConnell voted to advance the bill to a conference committee (as did Reid), but that was a brief point in the legislative process. To hang this attack on a handful of long-ago votes — when he much more recently helped kill gun control legislation — is absurd. So overall, Bevin’s add goes back to 1991 to cherry-pick votes and make it seem like McConnell and Reid were on the same side. Actually, McConnell repeatedly voted against the 1991 bill, on both its gun restrictions and the overall measure. The claim that McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe gun rights is contradicted by many other votes, both then and now. The claim is not only wrong, but ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Matt Bevin	None	None	None	2014-02-24T14:53:50	2014-02-19	['Harry_Reid', 'Mitch_McConnell']
pomt-01227	Keystone XL allows "Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/20/barack-obama/obama-says-keystone-xl-exporting-oil-experts-disag/	President Barack Obama and many other Democrats think there’s little to be gained by building the Keystone XL pipeline. On Nov. 18, Senate Democrats voted down a proposal to build the oil pipeline -- which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to Texas' coast.. But the issue isn’t going anywhere. When the new Republican-led Senate takes over in January, it will likely be at the top of their priorities list. Obama and other Keystone critics have argued that the pipeline would have a negative environmental impact, while having little benefit for the United States. For example, constructing the pipeline would result in few permanent American jobs. "Understand what this project is," Obama said at a Nov. 14 press conference in Burma. "It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices." Two days later, in Brisbane, Australia, Obama described Keystone XL as "a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world markets, not to the United States." Predicting the effect of the pipeline on gas prices is a little tricky. Experts tend to agree that it could impact gas prices, but the effect would be indirect and minimal. But in this fact check, we’re going to focus on the export question -- whether or not, as Obama said, Keystone XL’s primary destination is beyond the United States. We found that Obama’s off the mark. Crude oil In recent years, the United States has become a net-exporter of refined oil products, like gasoline, jet fuel and asphalt (meaning it exports more products than it imports), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, it is a net-importer of the crude oil it uses to make those products. Keystone XL would transport crude oil from Canada’s tar sands through the Midwestern United States down to the Gulf Coast, and there are refineries all along the proposed route. (The map is from TransCanada, the pipeline operator.) America gets more crude oil from Canada than any other country. Nearly all of Canada’s exports go to the United States, and this accounts for about a third of America’s total crude oil imports. Much of its oil already makes it to the United States by rail and existing pipelines. We asked several energy economics experts, and they believe that quite a bit -- if not most -- of the Keystone XL crude oil will be bought and used by American refineries. "It’s difficult to say with any certainty, but it is most likely that most would be refined in the U.S.," said Kenneth Medlock, an expert in energy economics at Rice University in Texas. A recent State Department report argues that it would not be "economically justified" for Canada to primarily export its Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United States, when there are plenty of American refineries to consume it. Some independent refineries -- particularly those in the upper Midwest, but also in Texas -- are in desperate need of crude oil, said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow in energy security at the Brookings Institution. Currently, the refineries have to import crude from places like Venezuela and Mexico -- though it would be cheaper and better for overall energy security to buy from a North American source, rather than pay high transport costs. On Nov. 17, TransCanada told Reuters, it "makes no business sense for our customers to transport oil down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, pay to export it overseas but then pay to transport millions of barrels of higher-priced oil back to the U.S. refineries to create the products we rely on." Ebinger added that many American refineries are geared to use heavy crude, which is what Keystone would transport from Canada’s tar sands. There would, though, likely be oil coming through the Keystone XL pipeline in excess of what the American refineries would be able to use, noted Eric Smith, an energy economist at Tulane University. This excess oil could go to other countries capable of refining it. Still, most Keystone oil would stay in North America. Refined products Some Keystone XL critics have focused on the fact that American refineries could export some of the products they make with the Canadian crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel fuel or asphalt. They argue that because products made in the United States, using Keystone XL oil, will leave the country, the pipeline wouldn’t improve domestic energy security or independence. Anti-Keystone XL environmental group Tar Sands Action (part of the larger 350.org) said in a Keystone XL fact sheet, that American refineries will process the oil but, "much of the fuel refined from the pipeline’s heavy crude oil will never reach U.S. drivers’ tanks." However, American oil refineries’ product exports are "not sensitive" to the addition of a new pipeline, the State Department study says. Export trends are more dependent on demand -- both domestically and abroad -- as well as the cost of natural gas and foreign refining capacity. American oil refineries are already increasing their exports, and that trend could continue independent of Keystone XL. "Refined product export levels have already increased and some of the crude used is from foreign sources," the report says. "As this may already be occurring, it may continue with or without (Keystone XL)." Further, the report says, "The economic viability of exports does increase the demand for crudes in the United States," but, "this demand does not depend on the proposed project." Even if exports are increasing, the majority of oil products refined in the United States stay in the United States. For example, in 2013, Gulf Coast area refineries produced about 946,000 barrels of finished motor gasoline per day. They exported about one-third of that -- 323,000 barrels per day. In January, Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked at an ad by liberal PAC NextGen Climate that said, "(China is) counting on the U.S. to approve TransCanada’s pipeline to ship oil through America’s heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs." A spokesman for NextGen told Fact Checker that they were referring to refined product exports, rather than crude oil. Fact Checker gave the ad its lowest rating of Four Pinocchios. Even if Keystone XL isn’t built, experts said Canada will find other ways to transport their oil to the United States. Canada already sends crude from the oil sands into the United States by rail and other pipelines. "I have no doubt that Canada will develop alternate means of monetizing its crude oil, whether that be via expanded rail shipments or by building pipelines to one or both of its coasts," Smith said. The longer that politicians debate Keystone XL, the more time Canada has to figure out these alternate means. "Keystone XL is rapidly becoming irrelevant," said Michelle Foss, energy economist at the University of Texas’ Bureau of Economic Geology. Our ruling Obama said, Keystone XL allows "Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else." The general consensus among experts, as well as the State Department, is that American refineries would be the primary buyers of crude oil transported through the Keystone XL pipeline, by a vast margin. Some Keystone XL critics have a point that American refineries would likely export some of the products that they make with crude oil transported by the pipeline. The State Department says, however, that product exports are already increasing, and that trend would likely continue independent of a new pipeline. Additionally, American refineries tend to keep more products in the country than they export. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-07048	"Protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/30/dan-kapanke/wisconsin-sen-dan-kapanke-says-protesters-caused-7/	As the unprecedented nine Senate recall elections approach, the red alert has been sounded by state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) Facing a challenge from state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), Kapanke issued an appeal June 28, 2011to subscribers to the National Tea Party Alert email service, seeking support and contributions. In the email appeal, which came from his campaign office under his signature, Kapanke warns "if we do not win here, liberals will be emboldened to try this recall tactic in states across the country." The email says "The unprecedented damage and intimidation union protesters caused in Wisconsin this year isn’t over." It lays out four "facts you may not know about the impact unions have had in Wisconsin." Among them, this headline: "Protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House." Beneath it: "Union protesters who swarmed the State House and climbed through windows in an attempt to disrupt the people’s business caused millions in damage in the process." We’ve been down this path before. Since the protests began, PolitiFact Wisconsin has rated seven statements about the conduct of protesters and claims of damage at the Capitol. One was Half True, one Barely True, one False, and four were Pants on Fire. The Pants on Fire category included one from Kapanke, in which he claimed protesters damaged the windshield of his car. Madison police said it was likely due to a pebble on the highway. And it also includes a March 3, 2011 claim by Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch who said protesters caused $7.5 million damage to the Capitol. That’s the same claim Kapanke is making now. The evidence for Huebsch’s claim -- which was almost immediately retracted -- was a single page, handwritten estimate. The state later paid $13,800 to historic preservation architect Charles Quagliana to assess the impact of weeks of protests on the Capitol and its grounds. His report said the damages resulted in $270,000 in wear and tear to the building. He cited unintended damage such as nicks and chips to stone, as well as stains to stone from skin oils (such as from hands), residue from tape used to hang signs and a few marker stains. "Essentially the building experienced three to five years of wear within a two-week period," Quagliana wrote. We asked Kapanke’s campaign about the $7.5 million claim. "We issued a correction on that," said campaign manager Jennifer Harrington, adding the campaign staff dug up a March 3, 2011 JSOnline blog post based on the original claim. But later blog posts and the March 4, 2011 Journal Sentinel article shot down the estimate. The March 4 story included a tour of the Capitol with state officials who said they saw very little obvious damage. They estimated that a cleanup would cost $347,000 if outside specialists were not needed -- an estimate that also turned out to be high. "Our guys were referencing the original article," Harrington said. "For whatever reason, nobody caught it." Kapanke did not respond to requests for comment. The campaign said an emailed correction had been sent to the tea party group, which sent the original solicitation to its members. Here’s what the Kapanke campaign posted on its website in an attempt to straighten it all out: "The estimated costs, including security, are in the millions of dollars but are not expected to reach the estimate referenced in the Journal Sentinel. Any costs to the taxpayers that are unnecessary such as damages to public property or recall elections hurt Wisconsin." But that statement mixes apples (damages) with oranges (the cost of security) and strawberries (the cost of the recalls, which include three led by Republicans against Democratic senators). A May 13, 2011 estimate said it cost $7.8 million to bring in police officers from around the state to handle the Capitol protests. The report says that figure is expected to grow because the estimate does not include overtime. But Kapanke’s original solicitation never mentioned security costs. So where does that leave us ... again? Kapanke’s campaign staff cited a March news account with a wildly inflated estimate of damage to the Capitol. That estimate was almost immediately withdrawn, and then reduced to $272,000 -- a fraction of the original estimate. The campaign acknowledged its mistake. Yet its revised statement changed the nature of the claim, broadening it from a claim solely about physical damage to the building. It’s starting to smell like a whole bunch of grills on a holiday weekend. We rated an earlier $7.5 million Capitol damage claim Pants on Fire. This one, too.

pomt-02438	Says "by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/28/louise-slaughter/louise-slaughter-tweets-four-five-black-and-hispan/	President Barack Obama recently announced a new initiative that was close to his heart: a national effort to close achievement gaps and create opportunities for minority boys. "My Brothers Keeper," unveiled at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, combines philanthropy and research to help move young men of color from the streets into schools and the workforce. "I'm going to pen this presidential memorandum directing the federal government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young men of color, and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies and with local communities to implement proven solutions," Obama said at the White House launch event. Many Democrats in Congress voiced their support for Obama’s push to help young minorities. Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter. "By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels," she tweeted. It’s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama’s new effort. But is it accurate? The Nation’s Report Card When we contacted Slaughter’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a White House fact sheet with an almost identical claim: "Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade – compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels." In turn, the White House said the numbers came from The Nation’s Report Card, a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race. Broadly, proficiency is defined by the government as students being "able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations." According to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level. While 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark. For each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics. Gaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade. It’s also worth noting that there’s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind. But Slaughter’s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics, we had to dive deeper into the report. Using the government’s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter’s numbers are right on. By contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient. And what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys. Our ruling Slaughter said that "by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency level." Government data backs up that depressing statistic, though it’s worth noting that the U.S. has at least seen improvements across all races since the early 1990s. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12811	"Just last year, alone, 710 police officers" were assaulted in New York state.	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/feb/11/martin-golden/police-assaults-new-york-have-decreased-recent-yea/	A bipartisan push in Albany would classify offenses against first responders and law enforcement officers as hate crimes. The Community Heroes Protection Act would also toughen the sentences for those convicted. State Sen. Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn and co-sponsor of the bill, said the number of assaults on police officers in New York state should convince his colleagues to support the effort. "The numbers show this law is definitely needed," Golden said. "Just last year, alone, 710 police officers - this is just police officers - were assaulted in this state." Is Golden right? Were that many police officers assaulted last year? Data from the FBI The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported the number of law enforcement officers killed and assaulted in the United States since 1972. The FBI defines a law enforcement officer as a local, state, and federal public authority who ordinarily carries a badge and a firearm. The report does not include attacks on correctional officers or emergency responders, though they are included in the proposed legislation. The bureau reported 710 assaults on New York state law enforcement officers in 2015, the latest data available. That’s the lowest number since 2007, when 656 officers were assaulted. The FBI's New York state number, however, is not a statewide figure. It only includes assaults on law enforcement officers outside New York City. The agency said it does not have data for reported assaults on law enforcement officers in New York City. Data from the NYPD The New York City Police Department reports its own data on police assaults, but it defines officers more broadly. The Police Department tracks assaults on police officers, peace officers, prosecutors, nurses, sanitation workers, firefighters, paramedics, city marshals, school crossing guards, traffic agents and emergency responders. The department said it does not report solely the number of assaults on law enforcement officers. Last year the department reported 1,632 assaults on people within the department's definition. That’s down from 2015, when 1,738 assaults were reported. Our ruling Golden said, "Just last year alone, 710 police officers … were assaulted in this state." Golden relied on FBI data that does not include assaults on officers from New York City. Golden undercounted, but his point is not lost: The number of reported assaults on law enforcement officers is significant. His statement needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4f5e2b87-867c-40c7-9c04-981acd31615a	None	Martin Golden	None	None	None	2017-02-11T13:07:43	2017-01-30	['New_York_City']
pomt-00965	"Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/16/center-western-priorities/conservation-group-oil-firms-can-lease-federal-lan/	Doubts that Washington is getting as much money as it should when it leases land to oil and gas companies go back 40 years. The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO. The conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on its website. "Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac," the center wrote. The going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is $3.99. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that. Greg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a September 2014 sales report from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman’s claim. Texas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres. That comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under BLM regulations, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid. Just to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn’t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights. Zimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There’s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five. "Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac," Zimmerman said. If the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee. It’s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies can obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn’t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for all of 2014, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively. One time, that led to a winning bid of about $1.50 per acre. From what we could find, the lowest lease prices were all in Nevada. Brad Posey is a managing director for Appaloosa Energy, a company that successfully secured the right to a few thousand acres at a cost of $2 each. Posey said the property comes with many hurdles before any wells can be drilled. "That land has so many restrictions on it," Posey said. "There are the prairie chickens, and habitat. A very limited portion can be explored on." Posey is correct about the land. A proposed resource management plan for the entire area puts a number of conditions on development. It protects municipal water supplies, grazing areas and trails for off-road trail riding. And animals. "These areas contain some of the most important habitat remaining for sage-grouse and other at-risk wildlife," the plan said. Posey called the venture "pure wildcat speculation." This raises the question, if it’s such a long shot, why is the land worth even $2 an acre? Because, as another Appaloosa managing director Martin Shields explained, sometimes an unpromising bit of land surprises you. "Many years ago, I was with a company that paid the $2 minimum and it paid off," Shields said. We asked Zimmerman if he knew of any land that went for $2 an acre that ever produced oil or gas. Zimmerman said he did not know of any case when it did. Our ruling The Center for Western Priorities said that oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac. A Big Mac goes for $3.99. Thousands of acres of land in Nevada were leased for $2 per acre in 2014. We found one case where federal land went for about $1.50 an acre. The track record on land leased at those low rates ever producing oil or gas is quite poor and the average leasing price nationwide is $220 per acre. The claim is accurate but it downplays that companies pay a hundred times as much for land that is more likely to be productive. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00059	"If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/nov/02/priorities-usa-action/democrats-cherry-pick-attack-gov-rick-scotts-immig/	An attack ad on Facebook features a Hispanic family sitting around the dinner table, bemoaning Gov. Rick Scott’s immigration policies. "This is our family, but if Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida," said the narrator. "He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S. Families belong together. Rick Scott turned his back on ours." Two Democratic groups, Priorities USA Action and the Senate Majority PAC, paid for the ad and placed it on a Facebook page, Nuestra Florida, which translates to Our Florida. Scott, a Republican two-term governor, is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. The lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): "Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship." But this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore. Did Scott encourage racial profiling of immigrants? This attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010. The video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor’s race. It says, "Scott favors Arizona’s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law." Scott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona’s SB 1070 to Florida. The 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police "may not consider race, color or national origin." Scott argued in 2010 that the law wasn’t racial profiling and said, "I clearly don't believe in racial profiling." But Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking his promise. A spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn’t matter to people who saw the Facebook post. "We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona," Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. "Just because he didn’t get it done doesn’t mean he didn’t pledge to do it." In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants. Exclude Dreamers from citizenship? This attack zeroes in on Scott’s statements against Dreamers early in his tenure. It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants. Dreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children. Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress. "I'm against the Dream Act," he said in December 2010. "Why? I don't believe in amnesty." In 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver’s licenses. Scott criticized the Obama administration’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as a policy "absent congressional direction." (DACA allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status — Trump later rescinded it.) Scott also argued that the Florida driver’s license bill was unnecessary because those with a federal employment authorization card could already obtain a temporary driver license. But in 2014 as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition. "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition," he said. That was a Full Flop from 2011 when he said "with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it." In September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to dismantle DACA, Scott issued a statement saying, "I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents." "These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately," he said. He elaborated on his point in a January 2018 USA Today calling for Congress to "secure the immigration status of Dreamers," a reference to Trump saying he would extend protections to Dreamers. Scott called on Congress to "do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams." While an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States. Our ruling A Facebook ad by Democratic groups said, "If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S." This ad leaves viewers with the misleading impression that these are current Scott policies. Neither is true. Scott did promise in 2010 to bring Arizona’s immigration law to Florida. Immigration advocates feared the law would lead to racial profiling. Once Scott was elected, he never pursued the idea. Scott was a bit more active in his earlier opposition to allowing Dreamers to stay in the country, but that has also changed. He publicly objected to Obama’s deferred action program for people who came into the country illegally as children, saying Obama bypassed Congress. Scott also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver’s licenses. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition and in the past year he has spoken in favor of helping Dreamers. In total, the ad creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by only drawing on part of his record. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12926	"I have never lobbied against sanctions personally... to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/rex-tillerson/tillerson-misleads-russian-sanctions-opposition/	U.S. senators grilled former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson about his past dealings with Russia at his recent confirmation hearing to become secretary of state. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson whether he thought Vladimir Putin was a war criminal (Tillerson's answer: "I would not use that term"), while Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pressed him on Exxon opposing sanctions against Russia. Senators have taken a hardline on Russia, both for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its likely interference in the 2016 elections. Some, including Rubio, were keen supporters of economic sanctions against Russia in 2014. At that time, Exxon, with Tillerson at the helm, had struck joint venture deals with the Russian petro giant Rosneft to explore for oil across the country. Exxon estimated its exposure on those deals at $1 billion. Sanctions presented big problems for those investments. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017, Tillerson rejected the assertion that he ever tried to scuttle sanctions. "I have never lobbied against sanctions personally," Tillerson said. "To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions." That’s an artfully crafted answer that’s pretty misleading Government lobbying records show that in 2014 and 2015, Exxon paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 to press "issues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector," along with a number of other matters. It paid another $120,000 in 2014 and 2015 to Avenue Solutions for work on a range of issues, including "energy sanctions in the Ukraine and Russia." In the same time frame, according to public logs, Tillerson visited the White House five times to see Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council. The meetings started about a week after President Barack Obama authorized the first of three rounds of sanctions. Bloomberg reported that Tillerson saw Treasury Secretary Jack Lew seven times in the second half of 2014. The Treasury Department oversees how sanctions are carried out. That seems to directly contradict Tillerson’s statement, but Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told us it didn’t. "Exxon Mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat American companies fairly," Jeffers said. "We do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed; that is a decision for policy makers." But at Exxon’s May 2014 shareholder meeting, Tillerson offered a more negative take on sanctions overall. He told reporters that sanctions are "imprecise and ineffective." and that "our views are being heard at the highest levels," he said, according to the Associated Press. Oil industry experts told us it’s hard to believe that Exxon wouldn’t have opposed the sanctions. Tadeusz Patzek is a professor and petroleum industry analyst at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Patzek thinks Tillerson is a good choice for secretary of state, but he also said Exxon’s interests in Russia were quite clear. "Russia is the last global frontier with big untapped oil resources that could be made available to Exxon," Patzek said. "From this point of view, Exxon must have viewed the sanctions as unhelpful to the corporation." Tim LaPira, a political scientist who studies lobbying at James Madison University, told us Tillerson’s claim is "implausible." "The message of what sanctions would do would necessarily communicate that they were taking a clear position against them," LaPira said. "If Exxon Mobil hired expensive lobbyists to communicate about sanctions, but not the corporation's position against them, then it seems to me they used shareholders' money to accomplish exactly nothing." Government ethics advocate Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, "I doubt they would lobby for a bill that essentially cost them $1 billion." Our ruling Tillerson said that he never lobbied against sanctions that targeted the Russian energy industry, nor to his knowledge had Exxon. But lobbying records show Exxon spent over $300,000 to argue its case on sanctions. Visitor records for the White House and the Treasury Department show Tillerson was a visitor when sanctions were being considered. An Exxon spokesperson said the company simply offered information on sanctions. But in 2014 Tillerson told reporters that he thought sanctions generally were ineffective and that he had let top government officials know what he thought of them.

pomt-03529	Says, "Oregon has the third largest class size in the nation."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/may/31/oregon-pta/does-oregon-have-third-largest-class-size-nation/	Advocates for school funding love to use statistics to draw attention to their cause and the Oregon PTA caught PolitiFact Oregon’s eye earlier this month with a juicy stat. In the group’s May 2013 newsletter, the PTA wrote that "Oregon has the third largest class size in the nation." With teacher layoffs in the headlines, we figured the state’s classrooms were probably experiencing some crowding, but third in the nation? We wanted to check that out. We asked Otto Schell, legislative director for the Oregon PTA, where the ranking came from. He said a 2013 report compiled by the National Education Association, the country’s largest teacher union, ranked Oregon third. "It’s a dubious honor to be in that top tier," Schell said. We looked it up and there was Oregon, ranked behind California and Utah. The NEA looked at the ratio of students to teachers to figure out the ranking. This isn’t the same as class size, which is different from the student-teacher ratio and is harder to measure. The average class size is always bigger than the pupil-teacher ratio, mainly because some teachers have planning periods and others work with small groups of students who have special needs, forcing the typical teacher to take on larger classes. A national headcount classroom to classroom would be a daunting data collection effort. Instead, researchers rely on staffing ratios to compare states since there’s a direct relationship between the student-teacher ratio and class size. Because of that, the two are often bandied around interchangeably. Oregon’s student-teacher ratio in the fall of 2011, according to the NEA, was 20.2. OK, so Oregon ranked third on the list according to data collected by the NEA. We wondered what other sources of data say about Oregon’s student-teacher ratio. The state of Oregon calculates student-teacher ratios a little differently, using an average of full-time-equivalent teaching positions and student enrollment across the school year. The state number is higher, with 21.3 students per teacher. That would still rank Oregon behind Utah and California in the NEA rankings. We wondered if the state calculation was consistently higher. Turns out it was, but not by much. Going back to the 2008-2009 school year, the statewide average student-teacher ratio was 19.1. The NEA pegged Oregon at 18.9. We also checked in on the United States Department of Education’s database of school statistics. The measure for the 2011-2012 school year isn’t available until June, so we looked at past data from the feds to see how it measured up against the NEA’s Oregon numbers. Historical federal data lined up closely -- but not exactly -- with the state numbers we found. Oregon fared poorly in the federal ranking. In the 2008-09 school year, the state had the fifth-largest student-teacher ratio. That ranking rose to third in 2009-10 and dropped back to fourth in the 2010-11 school year. So overall, three data sets produced very similar results about Oregon’s student-teacher ratios, all of which say the state has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the United States.

pomt-12245	Says two of U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/13/blog-posting/fake-news-saga-wrongly-says-nancy-pelosis-daughter/	A series of fake news posts appearing across several websites said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don’t even bother to consistently use the same fake names. The bogus saga of the House minority leader’s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The posts all invoked Pelosi’s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat’s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine. But the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days. At first the women were said to be caught in Berkeley, Calif., with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were apprehended at the Mexican border. The yarn went on and on, across several posts. The gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and agreed to turn on their mother after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It’s never really specified how.) Eventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the cabin in which they were staying burned down. They turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y., however, so all was well. Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the stories appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, FreedomCrossroads.us or TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair. He writes absurd stories about Democrats with the goal of tricking conservative readers into believing they (and his website) are real. OurLandOfTheFree.com said it "makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality." FreedomCrossroads.us has an About Us page that claims the site "uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth." The posts don’t align very well, with details varying from story to story, such as the women’s ages or even names, which change constantly. Sometimes the pair are called Heather and Nicole. Or maybe Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn. Or Jillian and Veronica. Or Amber and Carly. Or Louanne and Marissa. For the record, Pelosi’s five children are daughters Christine, Alexandra, Jacqueline and Nancy, and one son named Paul. At least a couple of images used on posts were actually of two women arrested for smuggling drugs. But those photos were of a pair of Scots arrested in Peru for trying to sneak cocaine to Spain in 2013. The grand finale is a July 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org under the headline, "Liberal troll paid $100K for Nancy Pelosi drug bust hoax." The post said George Soros paid the author to fool people for his own amusement, but that "in the end, everyone knows Pelosi is guilty and (Hillary) Clinton is behind everything." Don’t be fooled by tales of Pelosi’s daughters being busted for drugs. It’s a fictional soap opera created to amuse trolls. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-15037	Says after leaving the White House, Hillary Clinton "was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House china, furniture and artwork that she had stolen."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/01/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-accuses-clinton-stealing/	An old complaint about Hillary Clinton, stemming from her days as first lady, is making a comeback during her run for the presidency. When the Clintons left Washington in 2001 at the end of President Bill Clinton’s second term, they took a lot of things with them. The problem was, they took some things they should have left behind. A conservative website called Radix News posted this graphic on its Facebook page: "After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House china, furniture and artwork that she had stolen." There is a grain of truth to this claim, but we found multiple problems -- the amount is off, and "stolen" is an inaccurate word to describe Clinton’s actions. Also, despite the graphic's use of the word "force," it’s important to note that law enforcement did not come into play in this episode. When Bill and Hillary left town Federal rules strictly limit gifts for nearly every member of the executive branch, but the exceptions include the president and vice president. They may accept gifts, due to the needs of protocol and etiquette. There are some limits, but for the most part, if you want to show your appreciation for the occupant of the White House, you can. This courtesy extends to the entire first family -- and, importantly for this fact-check, if they want to keep those gifts when they leave, they can. The president must report gifts over a certain value; during most of the Clinton years, the amount was $250, though today it is $350. When Bill Clinton completed his term, he submitted a final disclosure form that listed roughly $190,000 in gifts. Clinton’s itemized list caught the eye of the Washington Post and provided plenty of fodder for the curious. People gave the president a notable quantity of golf clubs. Movie star Sylvester Stallone gave him a pair of boxing gloves. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg sent him china. And one Steve Mittman from New York gave him two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. The problem was, Mittman and a few others included on the list said they never intended their gifts to go to the Clintons. They thought they were donating to the White House itself as part a major remodeling project in 1993. This is where the questions of provenance get muddy. Some gifts are intended for the government, and must stay in the government’s hands, while some are intended for the person living in the White House. But it’s not always as simple as "this is mine" and "that is Uncle Sam’s." Within about two weeks of the publication of the Post article, public criticism escalated, and the Clintons announced that they would pay the government nearly $86,000 for items that were actually government property. A few days after that, they also returned about $48,000 worth of furniture (including the sofas, chair and ottoman from Mittman). Add that up and the government got back $134,000 out of the $190,000 the Clinton’s had declared as gifts. But as an indication of how hard it is to determine ownership, the National Park Service, which oversees the White House property, later returned a chair and an ottoman to the Clintons. The House investigates The House Committee on Government Reform looked into the fracas over the Clintons’ gifts. While its report never accused the former first family of criminal wrongdoing, it noted shortcomings in how gifts were processed, saying there was no independent assessment of gifts and that some had likely been undervalued. For example, lawmakers were skeptical of the estimated value of $240 for a John Quincy Adams-signed original land grant from 1826. There was also a large Coach leather travel bag, which the White House estimated at $200 but which investigators found priced at $498 to $698, and a Tiffany necklace valued at $150 but that Tiffany's valued at $450 to $1,000. There were instances of a twisted paper trail in which the National Park Service thanked donors for certain items but never formally added them to the permanent White House collection, which meant the Clintons could take them for themselves or for the Clinton Library. The committee found that giving things to the White House and its occupants was governed by several laws and six federal offices and agencies. Its overall conclusion was that the system was too complicated and left the government vulnerable. "Since the current system is subject to abuse and political interference, there is a need for centralized accountability in one agency staffed by career employees," it said. Among the aspects of the case that lawmakers found troubling was the apparent violation of the ban on soliciting gifts. It’s fine under the law to accept someone’s generosity, but you can’t tell them what you want. This came up in regards to a portion of the goods the Clintons kept -- about $38,000 worth of goods given to Hillary Clinton in December 2000. That was after she won her Senate race in New York, but before she took office, at which point accepting such gifts would have violated Senate rules. Clinton had created a gift registry at Borsheim’s Fine Jewelry and Gifts. This yielded 16 rimmed soup bowls worth $2,352 and a soup tureen worth $1,365, among other items. Even before the registry episode, the White House had retained an interior decorator who, according to the report, coordinated 43 of the 45 furniture gifts received over the Clintons’ eight years. Kathleen Clark focuses on government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis. For her, that interior decorator raised a flag. "I don’t know how you coordinate gifts without soliciting them," Clark said. Ultimately, the first family retained 227 of 14,770 gifts given over the eight years. The accusation of theft The viral image accuses the Clintons of theft. However, their public declaration of all the things they were taking makes it harder to call what they did "stealing." "Calling the Clintons’ actions ‘stealing’ or ‘theft’ is hyperbolic," Clark said. "It’s hard to take that language seriously in this context." Richard Painter served as the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. He now teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School. Painter said the paper trail is "strange." "Perhaps it was stuff that was given to them and they turned it over to the government and then changed their mind and treated it as a gift to them and put it on the 278 (disclosure form) and took it with them," Painter said. "That is more debatable, depending on the intent of the donor." The congressional report notes that there were some instances in which donor wishes were disregarded, but it also describes confusion in defining ownership and disposing of the gifts. To the extent that the Clintons were forced to pay for or return certain items, that was not under penalty of law. It would be more accurate to say that they quickly bowed to public pressure. The Reagans had issues too As an aside, we’ll note that the problem of gifts to the first family was not a new one. For instance, the IRS investigated President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1989. At issue were gowns worth as much as $25,000 and diamond jewelry that had been loaned to Nancy Reagan. A year before, the White House Ethics Office found that the president could accept a $2.5 million home in Bel Air, Calif., purchased on his behalf by undisclosed friends. However, the Reagans ultimately repaid the donors. Our ruling A viral graphic said that Hillary Clinton was forced to return about $200,000 worth of furniture, artwork and china that she had stolen from the White House. The statement contains several inaccuracies. The Clintons returned about $48,000 in furniture, and they paid the government about $86,000 for other items. Any way you count it, the $200,000 figure is too high. According to top ethics lawyers, it’s at least debatable -- and at worst hyperbolic -- to say the Clintons "stole" the items. A congressional investigation found poor tracking of ownership and final disposition of gifts, which makes it hard to speak definitively of wrongdoing. In fact, two items the Clintons returned were ultimately sent back to them. Finally, it’s worth making clear that the "force" they responded to was political pressure, not legal jeopardy. Accusations of stealing are serious and require a high threshold of evidence, unmet by the charges in this over-the-top graphic. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12360	"Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/07/vet-tv/idea-donald-trump-will-split-marines-navy-unfounde/	The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long and intertwined history. While the Marines are considered a separate branch of the military, and while the Commandant of the Marine Corps is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine commandant formally answers to the Secretary of the Navy, and the corps has been considered part of the Department of the Navy since 1834. The United States Naval Academy commissions officers for both. So it would be a pretty big deal if President Donald Trump acted to officially separate the two military branches from each other. That’s what a widely shared item on the website Vet TV said. Is it true? The short answer: No. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds. An article on the website is headlined, "Trump Removing Marines From the Navy." The article claims, "President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy. The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare." Setting aside the tiny likelihood that the administration knows in detail what executive orders Trump will be signing on a specific date six months down the road, there is no evidence to support the notion that he will be splitting the two branches. "We have not heard anything about that. Semper Fidelis," said Marine Capt. Ryan Elizabeth Alvis, a public-affairs official at the Marine Corps headquarters. The Navy referred PolitiFact to the office of the Secretary of Defense, which referred us to the White House. The White House declined to comment on the record. As it happens, there may be an explanation for why the article ran. Vet TV bills itself as an entertainment and humor site for veterans -- though it would be hard to know that from the web page in question. All the way down at the bottom of the article, past the lengthy reader comment section, is this description of Vet TV: "The first television network created by and for post 9/11 veterans without civilian influence. Hollywood wouldn't make this for us, so we did it ourselves. Get ready to laugh at everything the DoD leadership doesn't want you to laugh at. This network is sure to offend p------, liberals, and probably our parents." Vet TV was founded by Donny O’Malley, a humorist and YouTube celebrity. According to his bio, O’Malley was a Marine infantry officer for almost six years, serving in Asia and Afghanistan and reaching the rank of captain. Vet TV was launched as a Kickstarter campaign, setting a goal of $250,000 and securing a total of $296,331 from 3,609 donors. The idea is to create a app and a website for irreverent videos that can be streamed across all devices. "Imagine the ‘Netflix of the military,’ but with all original content," as O’Malley describes it. The project is set to launch later this month and dubs itself "the Comedy Central of the military." However, the article about the Navy-Marines split does not include a prominent "satire" label, and much of the text of the article itself rather mundane. As a result, it would be easy for social media users to think that word of the inter-branch split was legitimate news. With the Navy-Marines article, "the first part of the piece isn’t very humorous at all," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Only deeper in the article does the satire become more obvious, he said, such as this passage: " ‘The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia,’ Sgt. Major Garrett explained." Janda said that the article does draw on a deep well of competition, and even tension, between the two branches. "The U.S. Marines were modeled on the Royal Marines in the same way that the early U.S. Navy modeled itself on the Royal Navy," he said. "Marines served on every ship, just like today. They fought as sharp-shooters or with bayonets in ship-to-ship encounters, made up landing parties, guarded the captain, and enforced discipline when needed. In mutinous situations they almost always stayed loyal to the captain, and for that reason, and because they enforced ship discipline such as executions and floggings, they were usually hated by sailors. Some of that mutual enmity, driven by rivalry and respect, endures today." O’Malley did not reply to an inquiry sent through his website.

pomt-09118	"Ninety-four percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/17/jim-demint/demint-says-94-percent-bills-are-passed-unanimousl/	EDITOR'S NOTE: On June 17, 2010, we rated the statement by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that "94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office." We said that the actual percentage was 27.9 and called it a Pants on Fire. (We've archived our original item here.) We soon received a number of letters from readers critical of the math we had used to come up with the percentage. We also received criticism from DeMint's office, for our math as well as for other issues. As a result, we decided to assign a new reporter to the item in order to take a fresh look. Below is our new analysis. On May 26, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, posted a video of one of his speeches on YouTube. Speaking about legislative openness, DeMint said that Congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues: "At this point in the Senate, 94 percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent -- 94 percent. So this is hardly a lack of productivity. And what this means is 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office." DeMint's number seemed high to us, so we decided to investigate. We see two broad areas to analyze. One is whether the percentage DeMint cites is accurate. The other is whether DeMint's percentage says anything valuable about how the Senate handles legislation. We asked DeMint's office for the source of his claim and were told it comes from a July 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. The report, which DeMint's office had originally asked CRS to prepare, notes that as of June 30, 2008, the Senate had passed 911 measures of various kinds during the 110th Congress. Of these measures, 855 were passed via unanimous consent -- an expedited process by which bills are passed unless a senator objects. This is the source of DeMint's 94 percent figure -- 855 bills passed by unanimous consent out of 911 total measures taken up. DeMint in his speech referred to all of these measures as "bills." But the CRS report broke them down more precisely. Some were formal bills or joint resolutions, both of which are binding. Others were simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions, which do not have the force of a law and do not require the president's signature. Of the 911 total measures, only 376 were legally binding bills and joint resolutions, according to the CRS report. The rest were simple and concurrent resolutions. Occasionally these non-binding resolutions inspire some controversy, but a look through the full list provided by CRS confirms that the vast majority are ceremonial or symbolic in nature. An example is a resolution "congratulating Charles County, Maryland, on the occasion of its 350th anniversary." Others from the CRS report include: • A resolution commending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's volleyball team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball Championship. • A concurrent resolution honoring the memory of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi. • A concurrent resolution authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. In making his calculation, the senator decided to include all measures, regardless of whether they were binding. But there's another way to do it: Remove from the calculation the measures that most people would agree don't require debate. DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton argues that DeMint was on solid ground calculating the numbers his way. "Nowhere in DeMint’s speech does he ever say that all 94 percent of these bills are controversial, or that all 94 percent need a roll call vote," Denton said. "DeMint is criticizing the process, not every bill passed by that flawed process. So to try to whittle down the number by focusing on only the bills PolitiFact finds controversial is a disingenuous attempt to discredit DeMint’s factual statement." We disagree. We think the fairer test is to focus on the bills that include some element of substance that demands debate. Doing it DeMint's way, in our view, essentially stacks the deck by enlarging the pool of undebated measures to include simple and concurrent resolutions. The CRS report does not consider them bills, and no one seriously expects the Senate to spend time debating the merits of whether to honor a college volleyball team or to praise the life of a late vintner through non-binding resolutions. So why should we pretend that all 911 measures deserve official debate -- which is what would be required to produce the 94 percent figure DeMint cites? We'll take the alternate approach. We started with the 376 legally binding measures (that is, the bills and joint resolutions). Then we looked closer. Of the 376, 88 were naming bills for U.S. Postal Service facilities -- legislation that, while legally binding, is almost always non-controversial and treated as pro-forma business by the House and the Senate. According to CRS, all of the naming bills passed by unanimous consent. Because these bills are not the kinds of measures requiring substantive debate, we'll subtract them. That gets us down to 288 bills. Another 30 passed by unanimous consent re-named a federal building, park, office or highway after someone -- another common category of bill that rarely if ever inspires debate. And four additional bills that were passed by unanimous consent addressed what seem to be non-controversial issues involving U.S. coins. That leaves 254 bills. We could scrutinize the CRS list for other non-controversial bills passed by unanimous consent, but we'll stop there; once you get beyond common categories like building namings, it gets tricky to determine whether a bill addresses a major, debatable issue just by its title, which is all that CRS lists. So, stopping here would define our universe of legally binding, non-naming, non-coinage bills at 254. The CRS study says (and DeMint's original math concurs) that 46 roll call votes and three voice votes were subject to debate in the chamber. If you subtract these 49 bills from the total number of non-trivial, binding bills (254), you get 206 bills passed by unanimous consent. We now have a couple ways to crunch the numbers. One is to say that 81 percent of non-trivial, binding bills (206 out of 254) were passed by unanimous consent. Alternately, you could separate out the 64 binding resolutions that CRS said were passed by unanimous consent but which received some debate. Doing this would mean that 56 percent of non-trivial, binding bills, received absolutely no debate. (DeMint's office argues that the "debate" on these bills cited by CRS was cursory and thus shouldn't be counted as debate.) Either figure would be lower than what DeMint said on the floor, and one of the percentages is quite a bit lower. They're also higher than the 27.9 percent we had in our previous article, which we now acknowledge is incorrect. However, we think what's wrong with DeMint's statement is actually broader than the arithmetic. We arrived at the percentages above after first excluding as ceremonial or symbolic 657 measures the senator had counted. These largely non-substantive measures that DeMint included accounted for more than 70 percent of the measures he used in his calculation. This significantly skews the picture of what kinds of measures were taken up in the Senate. As any veteran Congress-watcher can tell you, the Senate, with its byzantine rules and back-room wheeling-dealing, can be a maddening institution. DeMint's call for reforming procedures and increasing openness likely has merit. His bipartisan efforts with Sens. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to ensure that legislation is disclosed and easily reviewable online prior to passage, and that it be pre-scrutinized for conflicts of interest and budgetary impact, among other things, are the kinds of goals that should be able to garner broad, bipartisan support. At the very least, one can question the wisdom of spending taxpayer money to pass hundreds of symbolic resolutions every two years, rather than debating the great issues at stake. Indeed, those unfamiliar with Senate procedures might be shocked to learn that even 56 percent of legally binding bills passed the chamber without debate. But DeMint wasn't content to limit himself to such evidence. In making his point, he ran up the score. Ultimately, we find that DeMint's goals, laudable though they may be, are undercut -- not strengthened -- by the math he chose to present in his floor speech. We'll own up to our own mathematical error, but we stand by our overall judgment from the initial article: Pants on Fire!	None	Jim DeMint	None	None	None	2010-06-17T16:47:05	2010-05-26	['None']
pomt-06751	"Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/	If some of President Barack Obama's supporters are irritated with him about jobs, it's understandable because the times are so hard, said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Brazile was responding to a question about harsh words for Obama from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. "The president has to do more than just run against Congress. He has to tell the American people that his administration has used every tool at their disposal to get job creation back on track," Brazile said. "But over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared. The average -- for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000. It has dropped. "So these families are hurting. They want help. They want relief. They don't want to hear about Congress. They don't want to hear about the tea party. They don't want to hear another plan. They want jobs," she said. We decided to fact-check Brazile's statement that "over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." We'll also explain her comment that "for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000," which actually has a critical slip of the tongue. She should have repeated the word "wealth" in place of "income." More on that in a bit. Brazile's first number comes from a recent study by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan "fact tank" that provides information on demographic trends but does not take policy positions. A study from Pew's Social & Demographic Trends project released a report about racial disparities in family wealth on July 26, 2011. That report analyzed data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), an economic survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Pew report analyzed household wealth, a very different measurement than income. "Household wealth is the accumulated sum of assets (houses, cars, savings and checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, retirement accounts, etc.) minus the sum of debt (mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt, etc.)," the report states. "It is different from household income, which measures the annual inflow of wages, interest, profits and other sources of earning. Wealth gaps between whites, blacks and Hispanics have always been much greater than income gaps." As you might be able to guess from that definition, home values are a critical component of household wealth, and plummeting home values were responsible for wiping out a good deal of household wealth. The Pew report specifically compared the data from the 2005 survey with a 2009 survey, the most recent data available. From the Pew report: "The Pew Research Center analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation-adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households. As a result of these declines, the typical black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009, the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth and the typical white household had $113,149." For comparison, in 2005 the median black household wealth was $12,124; Hispanic household wealth was $18,359; and white household wealth was $134,992. Brazile said that, "Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." The Pew report wasn't for the most recent four years, as Brazile's words imply, but for the period between 2005 and 2009. However, as we already noted, that is the most recently available data from the Census. We're doing a fact-check on the 53 percent loss of black wealth claim, but we should point out that Brazile went wrong in her second statement -- "for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000" -- when she said "income." She should have simply repeated the word "wealth." We're rating Brazile's statement, "Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." That is the percentage that the Pew report found, based on data collected by the U.S. Census. But the years in question were 2005 to 2009. So we deduct one notch off the Truth-O-Meter and rate Brazile's statement Mostly True.	None	Donna Brazile	None	None	None	2011-08-24T10:21:39	2011-08-21	['None']
pomt-11003	On assault weapons, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s position is "way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/11/chris-murphy/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-gun-control-second/	Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee’s position on the Second Amendment. "Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical," Murphy tweeted July 9. "He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway. After reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment. Assault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot. The Heller case One of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller’s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia. Scalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment "is not unlimited," and upholds "laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." The question of assault weapons never came up. Instead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district’s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented. "There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles," Kavanaugh wrote. "Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses." Scalia’s opinion When the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case. The case in question was Friedman vs. Highland Park, a challenge to a Chicago suburb’s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh’s in the rejection, which Scalia joined. Scalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by Heller. "The city’s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes," Thomas wrote. "Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons." "In the Highland Park case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia," said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Murphy’s office pointed out that Scalia’s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous. "You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there’s definitely a split of opinion on this," said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute. Our ruling Murphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh’s position is "way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia." Kavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case Heller vs. District of Columbia. Scalia’s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons. We found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh’s position and Scalia’s are substantially similar. Leaving room for legal interpretation, we rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13855	"Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/08/pat-toomey/kenney-blasts-pat-toomeys-fearmongering-around-san/	Sen. Pat Toomey lost a major battle on the Senate floor this week when Democrats blocked his attempts to advance a bill that would have stripped millions of dollars in funding from so-called "sanctuary cities," including Philadelphia. In a statement before the vote, Toomey, who’s in a bitter fight for re-election this year, said "Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally." Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney disagreed. The Democrat in his first year as mayor released a statement this week excoriating Toomey, a Republican, saying the senator’s "inaccurate" statements "are nothing more than fearmongering" and were "pulled straight from Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant playbook." He said the city does cooperate with federal investigators in cases related to suspected terrorism. So who’s right? We decided to check the claim. Philadelphia’s immigration policy and terrorism When Kenney entered office earlier this year, one of his first moves as mayor was to reinstate Philadelphia’s status as a "sanctuary city." In this case, that means the city will not comply with Department of Homeland Security requests for Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds, a tactic used by federal officials to detain undocumented immigrants who otherwise would have been released from police custody. Dozens of jurisdictions across the nation have "sanctuary" policies. Proponents argue DHS uses ICE holds to arbitrarily detain undocumented immigrants accused of petty crimes. Philadelphia’s executive order stipulates that a detainer request will not be followed, nor will notification of a person’s pending release go out to DHS, unless the person is being released "after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving violence and the detainer is supported by a judicial warrant." Toomey’s office points to this as the problem. There’s nothing in Kenney’s executive order that explicitly allows officials in Philadelphia to communicate the pending release of a suspected terrorist who was not convicted of a violent crime with federal investigators. Toomey’s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson pointed out the "vast majority of suspected terrorists would not fit into Mayor Kenney’s narrow category." "Philadelphia police are forbidden to share information or otherwise cooperate to apprehend those terror suspects who have not yet been convicted of a violent first or second degree felony — a category that encompasses Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsaernev [sic], the San Bernardino shooters, and the Orlando shooter," she wrote in a prepared statement. However, if any of those attacks had taken place in Philadelphia, police would have communicated with federal investigators because none of those examples are undocumented immigrants. Tsarnaev’s citizenship was approved. One San Bernardino shooter was in America on a visa, the other was born in Chicago. The Orlando shooter was born in New York. Toomey’s office said it used these only as examples to illustrate that most terrorists had not been convicted of violent crimes prior to committing an act of terrorism. And they’re right. Nine out of 10 individuals on the terror watch list who tried to buy a gun last year were approved and passed a background check that would have flagged them had they been convicted of a felony. But when asked if the city would cooperate with a DHS detainer request in the case of a suspected terrorist who was an undocumented immigrant convicted of a minor offense, Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said: "The City of Philadelphia does cooperate with the federal government in the case of suspected terrorism." She said the city complies with federal criminal complaints "so that someone who is accused of a crime, like terrorism, would be detained pursuant to the complaint." Cooperating with the feds Kenney’s sanctuary city law was put into effect largely to curb federal overreach and to protect undocumented immigrants from being deported after being accused of a minor offense. Paula Meninato, the civic engagement coordinator for the Philadelphia-based Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, said Toomey’s concerns about suspected terrorists going free in Philadelphia and other sanctuary cities are misplaced. "Most of the people that are targeted by these policies… are people that either got arrested for petty crimes or people that haven’t done anything at all," she said, "that get targeted by police who are just regular people trying to make a living." However, Philadelphia says it does cooperate with DHS related to those convicted of violent crimes. Of the thousands of undocumented immigrants deported last year, DHS reported that more than 1,000 were suspected gang members. But it didn’t report that any were suspected terrorists. A DHS official told PolitiFact that the city’s existing executive order "does not appear" to allow the city to honor ICE detainers or requests for notification of pending release with respect to any individuals in the custody of the City of Philadelphia. "With the implementation of the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) more than a year ago, many law enforcement agencies that had previous(ly) declined to cooperate with ICE, including some large jurisdictions, are now once again working with the agency," ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said in a prepared statement. To support Toomey’s claim that sanctuary cities don’t cooperate with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism, his office pointed to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who traveled to Philadelphia this year to urge Kenney to comply with the department’s Priority Enforcement Program which prioritizes the deportation of violent criminals. After his meeting with Kenney, Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer: "The mayor and I had a good dialogue," though Kenney wouldn’t budge on his policy. In testimony before a senate committee last week, Johnson specifically called out Philadelphia for not complying. "I will note that I have had conversations with city officials in Philadelphia and in Cook County, Illinois without success so far," he said. "And I have urged a number of cities and counties that it’s for the benefit of public safety that dangerous criminals not be released." Kenney’s also been urged by both Toomey and his Democratic opponent for Senate Katie McGinty, both of whom said Kenney should reconsider the city’s level of cooperation with federal investigators looking to gain information about undocumented immigrants in the city’s custody. Toomey’s bill, which was defeated in a procedural vote on Wednesday, would strip Community Development Block Grants from sanctuary cities like Philadelphia who refuse to comply with certain DHS detainer requests. This year, Philadelphia received $40 million from such grants, leading local officials and PA Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, to oppose Toomey’s legislation. The incumbent Republican Senator has made sanctuary cities a critical issue in his campaign against McGinty. She hasn’t come out in full support of Kenney’s policy, but she also hasn’t outright rejected it. Our Ruling In order to support his sanctuary city legislation, Toomey said "Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally." Philadelphia officials unequivocally deny that, saying they have and will work with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism. They reject Toomey’s statements that imply officials in the city don’t work with the feds in cases of terrorism, as Kenney’s sanctuary city policy applies only in cases involving undocumented immigrants not convicted of violent crimes. Last year, DHS didn’t report bringing any suspected terrorists into custody solely based on his or her immigration status. But there isn’t anything in Philadelphia’s existing executive order carving out an exception for suspected terrorists who haven’t been charged with a violent crime, and the Obama administration has urged the city to reconsider that stance. It’s the city’s word vs. language in the order. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2016-07-08T11:19:12	2016-06-27	['Philadelphia']
pomt-10764	"Mitt Romney opposed the gun lobby, even Ronald Reagan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/24/log-cabin-republicans/romney-supported-gun-control-in-previous-runs/	Mitt Romney portrays himself now as a supporter of gun rights and a fan of Ronald Reagan. But Romney took positions favorable to gun control in previous races in Massachusetts, a state with strict gun control laws. In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat stalwart Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them. … I won't chip away at them." Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' Face the Nation on Oct. 21, 2007. On the gun issue, Romney said, "I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it." On his Reagan comment: "Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. … And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, `No, I'm my own person.'" Romney's explanations not withstanding, the sly TV from the Log Cabin Republicans accurately portrays his positions from previous races. Could the group have made it clear that Romney's statements today have a different tenor? Yes. But we still find the substance of their statements correct, so we give them a Mostly True.

pomt-03567	"We are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/may/20/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-sticking-altered-700000-jobs-promis/	To hear Gov. Rick Scott tell it, his memorable campaign pledge to create 700,000 jobs in seven years is going right along schedule. The novice politician, almost two and a half years into his first term, says things are looking bright for the Sunshine State as a result of investments in economic development and public education. "Our unemployment rate has now dropped to 7.2 percent – well below the national average, and we are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years," Scott wrote in a letter explaining line-item vetoes in the 2013-14 state budget. As much as we love belting Bon Jovi anthems -- WHOAAAAA, we’re halfway there! -- it’s premature to sing Scott’s praises for fulfilling half of the jobs he promised in the centerpiece of his 2010 campaign. Our qualm with this claim comes down to details about his pledge that he has since abandoned. These details that may not fit in a zippy campaign ad, but they do come straight from Scott’s mouth. The promise at hand is rated Stalled on the Scott-O-Meter despite the state adding 302,500 net jobs since December 2010. This factors in Scott’s first month in office, January 2011. Excluding that month puts the jobs total at 285,100. The size of the state’s employment pool in April 2013 is about the same as it was in July 2004, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Why is it Stalled? Because Scott told us in a debate and in press accounts that his 700,000 jobs would come on top of Florida’s normal growth as it added jobs lost during the recession. State economists expected the state to add about 1 million jobs by 2017. "It's on top of that," he told a reporter in 2010. "If you do these things, we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs." So Scott needs about 1.4 million more jobs by 2017 to fulfill his original promise of 1.7 million jobs. Through 28 months in office, the state has added less than 20 percent of the jobs he needs to meet that mark. Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. In a response to our inquiry about this claim, spokeswoman Jackie Schutz asked us to note the state’s unemployment rate of 7.2 percent is below the national average of 7.5 percent for the second straight month. That, for the record, is correct. Our ruling Scott said the state is "already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years." By his preferred measure since taking office -- 700,000 jobs regardless of normal growth -- he’s in the ballpark. By the measure he asked Floridians to hold him accountable to -- 700,000 jobs on top of 1 million jobs in normal growth -- he still has quite a long ways to go. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-05164	The Americans for Tax Reform pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/18/nathan-deal/deals-defense-tax-pledge-fails-truth-test/	PolitiFact Georgia switched on its Flip-O-Meter recently to discover Gov. Nathan Deal flip-flopped on his commitment to oppose tax increases. Now Deal is countering. During his campaign for governor, Deal signed a pledge created by the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform saying that he "will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." Two years later, the fiscal conservative is backing a tax referendum that would raise $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, and as much as $8.5 billion after inflation, to build transportation projects across metro Atlanta. Full Flop, we ruled. Days after our story was published, Deal denied that he violated the pledge. The pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action," Deal told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog Wednesday. This argument drew our attention. One of the reasons we gave Deal a Full Flop was that Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, said for our June 8 article that "it does violate the pledge." "It’s a rather significant tax increase," Norquist said. Who’s right? Did the pledge Deal signed cover only "new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action?" Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter. Deal, the leader of state government, has been open about his support for the proposed 10-year, 1 percent sales tax -- also know as the T-SPLOST -- that would fund 157 transportation projects across the Atlanta region. Voters decide on the measure July 31. The governor says the projects are needed to ease traffic congestion in metro Atlanta and will help attract and keep businesses throughout the state. Deal has spoken at a Buckhead fundraiser for the referendum and voiced his support to several large audiences in recent months, such as at the Atlanta Press Club, the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce and at an event in Savannah. The Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform believes any new legislation or changes to an existing tax structure that results in a new tax increase on individuals is a violation of the pledge by lawmakers who have signed it. Thanks to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, ATR has become a major player in Republican Party politics. More than half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the federal version of the pledge, and nearly half the U.S. Senate has joined them. But the pledge is strict, and even self-avowed fiscal conservatives are starting to break ranks. Just last week, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said lawmakers should be able to use money the federal government saves by eliminating tax loopholes to pay down the national debt. "We’re so far in debt that if you don’t give up some ideological ground, the country sinks," Graham said in an ABC-Yahoo interview. On the state level, there’s transportation tax supporter Amos Amerson, a Republican who is leaving the House of Representatives after 12 years. He decided the pledge isn’t always practical and asked in a 2002 letter to be removed from ATR’s list. Amerson said he never received a response. There are two versions of the pledge: one for federal politicians and another for the state level. The federal pledge asks signers to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions or tax credits "unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing taxes." The state version is brief. Politicians fill in the blanks of a single-sentence pledge: "I ____ pledge to the taxpayers of the state of ____ that I will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." It makes no mention of taxes that are initiated by legislative action. Or anything else, for that matter. Deal signed the state version May 10, 2010, during his campaign for governor. Our Flip-O-Meter ruling quoted Deal spokesman Brian Robinson, who said it was unfair to say the governor flip-flopped on his commitment to oppose tax increases. But Deal earned a Full Flop just the same. The T-SPLOST is an increase in the sales tax. There are no cuts to make it revenue-neutral. Now, back to our Truth-O-Meter check. After our story ran, the AJC’s Political Insider blog reported Deal said he has an out because the pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action." How does he fare? The governor’s office declined to comment for this fact-check, so we used some of Deal’s comments to reporters Wednesday to allow him to explain himself. "I am advocating for it because this is not a legislatively imposed tax," he said. "It is a tax increase that the people themselves will decide about. And for those who say otherwise, it seems to me that they would take away the right of the people to express their opinions of this importance." ATR’s state government affairs manager, Joshua Culling, told us that Deal is wrong about his interpretation of what he signed. "The governor’s pledge is to ‘oppose and veto’ all taxes," Culling said. "By vocally supporting T-SPLOST, he certainly isn’t holding up the first half of his commitment." ATR knows the meaning of the pledge better than anyone. It says Deal is wrong about his interpretation. We agree. Our rating: False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-06-18T06:00:00	2012-06-13	['United_States']
pomt-07055	Says President Barack Obama said that if he doesn’t turn the economy around after three years in office, he’ll be a one-term president.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-uses-barack-obamas-one-term-presi/	It’s becoming a staple of Michele Bachmann’s interviews and stump speeches: The notion of just one term for President Barack Obama … suggested by none other than President Barack Obama himself. But is it accurate? During the roll-out of her presidential campaign on June 27 and June 28, 2011, Bachmann -- a three-term Republican congresswoman from Minnesota -- used a variation on the line several times. Presidential campaign announcement, Waterloo, Iowa, June 27: "We're practical people. We know our country can work; we just want it to work again. It's a very powerful coalition that the left fears; and they should, because, make no mistake about it, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. In February 2009, President Obama was very confident that his economic policies would turn the country around within a year. He said, and I quote, 'A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.' Well, Mr. President, your policies haven't worked. Spending our way out of the recession hasn't worked. And so Mr. President, we take you at your word." Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, June 27: "The president has not delivered as he said that he would. I gave a quote in my announcement speech today, Sean. It was from February 2009. And the president of himself said, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency that in all likelihood, he would be a one-term president. And what I said today in my speech today, is that I take the president at his word. And I think the American people are all too eager to make him a one-term president." Interview with Rebecca Jarvis of CBS News, June 28: "Remember, President Obama said in February of 2009, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency, that he should only be entitled to one term in office. I think the American people agree with that." Backyard event in Raymond, N.H., June 28: "In February 2009, the president gave an interview, and in that interview he said, 'If I failed to turn the economy around by the third year, then we will have a precedent for being a one-term president.' ... Do you think we should take him at his word? I do, too." Each of these comments by Bachmann is slightly different, but the gist is always the same: In the interview -- with NBC’s Matt Lauer on Feb. 1, 2009, just days after his presidency began -- Obama said it was up to him to turn the economy around in three years, and if not, he doesn’t deserve a second term. So we looked back at the original interview. Here’s the transcript of the relevant portion: Lauer: "At some point will you say, `Wait a minute. We've spent this amount of money, we're not seeing the results. We've got to change course dramatically.’ " Obama: "Yeah, look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years and... Lauer: "You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happened." Obama: "That's exactly right. And you know, a year from now I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. But there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." Obama’s last phrase -- "there's going to be a one-term proposition" -- is a little awkward, but we don’t think there’s much doubt about his meaning. We understand his comment to mean that if the economy isn’t better in three years, the voters might make him a one-term president. So is Bachmann correctly framing Obama’s comment? In her announcement speech, she did remove one sentence from what she described as a direct quote -- "But there's still going to be some pain out there." Taking it out does eliminate one indication that Obama acknowledged that even an improved economy would inflict some pain on Americans. This isn’t a trivial omission, but it’s not a major one. More important, we're not convinced that the president said he actually would be a one-term president if the economy has not improved in three years -- just that he raised the possibility that voters would make that call. Each of the phrasings we cited above is slightly different, but we think that she is justified in pointing out that Obama offered a three-year framework for turning the economy around and that he acknowledged that Americans might not support a second term if he didn’t deliver. So we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-06-29T14:51:28	2011-06-27	['None']
pomt-13459	"If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations."	false	/texas/statements/2016/sep/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrect-about-obama-giving-control-inte/	Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says the federal government is about to give away control of the internet. Really? A shift has been in motion, we found, yet not a handoff of all things web. As of October 2016, that is, contractual federal oversight of the California nonprofit that’s managed website domains since 1998--the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers--is set to end in what proponents including ICANN and administration officials describe as a long-planned shift to the greater world community. The transition plans accelerated, according to a March 2014 New York Times news story, in the wake of revelations in documents made public by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had been intercepting internet traffic as part of global spying efforts. This summer, Cruz and a fellow Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to bar any handoff of the internet-related duties unless Congress gives approval. Talking up the proposal, Cruz said in Sept. 8, 2016, floor remarks: "In 22 short days, if Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations." Cruz went on to say the administration is "pushing through a radical proposal to take control of internet domain names and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries." Cruz warned too that this will empower countries such as Russia, China and Iran to censor speech on the web. Cruz’s backup We sought the basis of Cruz’s statement about the administration giving away control of the internet. By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack noted ICANN is slated to no longer be under contract with the federal government. His email said that under the slated-to-go arrangement, "only the United States can authorize any changes to the authoritative root zone file, which is used to operate the internet and is essentially the master address book. By giving up those contracts, the United States is, in a very real sense, giving up control of the internet." By "root zone file," Novack was referring to the nonprofit’s coordination of the domain name system, meaning a text file of the top-level domains that form part of web addresses. Contrary to Novack's characterization, though, the root zone file is not the "master address book" of the Internet, Milton Mueller, a professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and author of a book on ICANN’s creation, cautioned when we asked. Rather, Mueller said by email, the root zone file "is just a list of top level domain names (like .COM, .ORG or .EDU)." Mueller presents a longer description in this September 2015 blog post. Mueller told us the domain name system solely ensures "that the domain names we use for websites and emails are globally consistent – if you type in an Iranian domain your browser knows where to find it. A lot of other aspects of Internet operations, such as routing, are completely separate from this." And generally, Mueller said, the internet consists of about 50,000 different private networks worldwide that use the Internet protocols to interconnect. "All of them operate their part of the Internet," Mueller wrote. "All of them could bypass ICANN if they needed to or wanted to. They all use a common domain name root because it makes the system globally compatible." Novack further excerpted a 1998 agreement reached by the U.S. Department of Commerce stating, in part, that written direction from a government official shall be requested before "making or rejecting any modifications, additions or deletions to the root zone file." By the government giving up that authority, Novack suggested, free speech on the web is at risk. Advocates declare flaws in claim Experts supportive of the pending changes told us there’s a lot wrong in Cruz's claim. First, we connected with ICANN officials who told us the plan is to sever the corporation from its Commerce Department contract as of October 2016, leaving the "global multistakeholder community"--meaning the private sector, in consultation with technical and intellectual property experts and government representatives--to guide and handle established duties, without a particular country holding oversight. Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security supportive of the shift, wrote in June 2016 that the federal "stewardship has greatly diminished as the organization (ICANN) has matured from a small operation on a shoestring budget to a large, professional corporation with more than 350 employees in seven offices around the globe. Global stakeholders, including U.S. businesses, end users, technical experts, public interest organizations and academics, oversee ICANN," Chertoff wrote. We inquired into the countries that, with the U.S., advise the corporation’s 20-member board, which was chaired as of September 2016 by Steve Crocker, the CEO and co-founder of Shinkuro, Inc., a start-up; he’s also one of the originators of the internet. Samantha Eisner, an ICANN lawyer, confirmed that the 171 countries advising the board include Russia, China and Iran as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. ICANN spokesman James Cole emailed us the full list of participating countries. When we checked, the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee was from Switzerland, its vice chairs from Argentina, Spain, Namibia, Thailand and Turkey. GAC membership, per the web page, stretched to include national governments "and distinct economies recognized in international fora; and, usually in an observer capacity, multinational governmental and treaty organisations and public authorities (including all the U.N. agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance such as the ITU, UNESCO and WIPO)." And according to an advisory committee web page, the panel’s advice must be taken into account by ICANN’s board, which includes a single non-voting Governmental Advisory Committee liaison, "and where the board proposes actions inconsistent with GAC advice it must give reasons for doing so and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution." So, we asked, might the advisory panel add up to a kind of United Nations? David Conrad, ICANN’s chief technology officer, told us the advisory panel isn’t a mini-UN in part because it’s not a ruling body and any recommendation it makes must be unanimous--meaning any country can stop movement--though the committee can offer information or make suggestions to the board without a consensus. More broadly, Conrad and other ICANN officials stressed, it doesn’t make sense to suggest a country controls the internet which, Conrad said, "is comprised of a set of privately operated networks which agree to exchange traffic using a common set of protocols. There is no central point of control of the internet at all. So, the idea that the U.S. is somehow giving up control through a contract that its entire purpose is to allow the administration of a set of identifiers is just sort of ludicrous." Mueller, asked if Cruz’s claim holds up, said by phone: "There’s no legitimate way for him to get to that conclusion. What he’s doing is fear-mongering and trying to create a bogeyman, which is the United Nations." Mueller said the whole point of the approaching shift is to keep domain names’ governance away from direct government oversight. Daniel J. Weitzner, an MIT official who told us he worked on the ICANN transition as an Obama administration adviser in the White House and Commerce Department, also responded to our inquiry by phone, saying the push for years has to been to ensure that no one country land the power to oversee the internet. Weitzner called Cruz’s claim "completely off base. There is no turnover to some nefarious organization." Separately, Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor expert on ICANN, said by phone the U.S. government can’t give away what it doesn’t own--the internet--and Cruz’s invocation of the U.N. seemed "rather grandiose" in that the duties at issue will continue to be overseen by the nonprofit whose board is advised only occasionally, Froomkin said, by the GAC. That said, he noted, the U.S. government will no longer independently contract with ICANN and so it will have less influence that way. Cruz's recommended authorities Novack, apprised that the experts we reached found Cruz’s claim short of factual, urged us to consult others including Phil Kerpen, who heads the conservative American Commitment advocacy group and chairs the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes any UN attempts to manage the internet. By email, Kerpen said that in context, Cruz’s claim is accurate; he said Cruz’s reference to control of the internet refers to the about-to-go federal oversight and the UN mention reflects on the GAC which, Kerpen said, can only be overruled by a supermajority of the ICANN board. That’s correct: ICANN’s Cole told us that under revised bylaws, it’ll take 10 (rather than the current nine) of 16 voting board members to spurn GAC advice while, Cole noted, it’ll take even more votes to reject advice from the corporation’s private sector policymaking body, the Generic Names Supporting Organization. Novack also pointed us to Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. By email, Schaefer suggested that while the intended transition wouldn’t lead to "government ‘control’ of ICANN as would be the case in a UN body, governments will have more authority in ICANN than they do currently." Schaefer and others said in a Sept. 8, 2016, white paper that governments will also be voting members of the new Empowered Community, which is vested with the power to dismiss the board or individual directors or reject or approve individual bylaw changes. "Governments have not had a say in these matters before," the paper says. By email, ICANN spokeswoman Emily Crane Pimentel confirmed the fresh role for government representatives. Then again, she pointed out, other interest groups also will play new roles per a February 2016 document adopted by the "multistakeholder community" and, she said, governments won't end up with more power than other stakeholders. Our ruling Cruz said: "If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations." As of October 2016, the U.S. government is set to no longer have a contract to oversee certain internet-related duties having to do with all of us finding websites. The tasks will continue to be handled through a California nonprofit that’s been in place since 1998. Upshot: There’s no pending government handoff of control of the internet that we can see. Also, the member-countries of an advisory panel to the nonprofit’s board can only make a recommendation if every nation agrees; that’s not U.N.-like. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14922	A Texas police department bought an ad telling drug dealers, "We can take your competition off the streets for FREE."	true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/30/facebook-posts/texas-police-department-places-ad-urging-drug-deal/	Snopes.com, which evaluates the accuracy of varied claims, declared in an October 2015 tweet that a Texas newspaper ran an ad purchased by the local police department encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers. "Is your drug dealing competition costing you money?" the described ad said. "Would you like to eliminate that problem? We can help! We can take your competition off the streets for FREE. Report your competition to us." Snopes.com’s Oct. 26, 2015 analysis said a person at the Lumberton Police Department, whom it did not identify, confirmed that the ad ran, though didn’t recall when. Snopes.com said it spotted the ad in an August 2015 Facebook post. Did police in the Southeast Texas town really place an ad encouraging drug dealers to nark each other out? We were curious enough to check it out on our own. By phone, David Lisenby, editor of the weekly Lumberton Ledger, confirmed that the Lumberton Police Department placed the ad. Lisenby added that the department subsequently purchased another direct appeal about dealers. Lisenby said he suggested the ads in hopes of encouraging community involvement. Lisenby emailed us copies of the first ad, which appeared in the paper’s Aug. 5, 2015, edition, and the follow-up ad, published Sept. 2, 2015. The second ad showed a marijuana leaf over a message directed to "drug users:" "Has your drug dealer ripped you off?" the second ad says. "Do you want justice? We can help! We can enact justice for you … for FREE." Wondering if the ads touched off a wave of snitching, we unsuccessfully tried to connect with Chief Danny Sullins of the Lumberton Police Department. Separately, a clerk for the county attorney in Hardin County, Telisha Green, told us by phone that police reports submitted to the office as backup for misdemeanor drug cases had yet to mention an instance of the ads leading to arrests. Prosecutors otherwise have no way of knowing, Green said, if the ads fueled investigations. But David Sheffield, Hardin County’s district attorney, said he’s heard the ads touched off calls to law enforcement. Sheffield said, though, it’s too early to judge results; investigations take time. Such an ad, he said, "gets your attention and it generates talk. Maybe it prompts somebody to do something they’d just been thinking about doing." Our ruling A Facebook post spotted by Snopes.com said Lumberton police placed an ad encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers. Actually, the Lumberton Police Department this year purchased two such ads in the local weekly. We didn’t pin down if the ads led to fresh snitching. We rate the claim True.

pomt-15214	"African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-accurately-says-black-children-asthma-have/	In her speech to the National Urban League on July 31, Hillary Clinton presented a long list of statistics showing that racial inequality persists in the United States. Among them was this figure: "African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids." Clinton claimed that it hit particularly close to home, as it reminded her of her time in the early 1970s working for the Children’s Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group for poor and minority children. That number surprised us, so we decided to see if it was true and, if so, why. Clinton may have underestimated Asthma is a chronic lung disease — an inflammation of the airways that causes coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Around 25 million Americans have asthma, and the rate of asthmatics has been steadily increasing since the early 1980s. While most asthmatics function normally, often using inhalers to aid them in their breathing, asthma attacks can present a serious danger, especially in young children. A 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on childhood asthma data from 1980 to 2005 confirms Clinton’s claim almost verbatim: "Compared with white children, black children have a 260 percent higher ED (Emergency Department) visit rate, a 250 percent higher hospitalization rate, and a 500 percent higher death rate from asthma." (Clinton’s campaign confirmed that this was the source she had used.) The report also notes that even though mortality rates from asthma have decreased since 1999 for children in general, no corresponding drop has been seen in the mortality rate of African-American children. There’s also more recent data available that further confirms Clinton’s claim, and even suggests she may have understated the problem. One study from 2014 examines rates of childhood asthma in black and white children, with the most recent data from 2010. Despite making up a much smaller portion of the population, 106 black children died of asthma in 2010, compared to 68 white children. The corresponding rates of death for black and white children respectively are 8.6 per million and 1.2 per million — that means a black child is about 7.2 times more likely to die of asthma than a white child. Even among those children of each race who already had asthma, black children had a mortality rate about 3.5 times higher than white children. Notably, the study also shows that the racial disparity is not as severe for other problems with asthma; while black children have higher rates of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations, the difference in those cases is not as large as it is with the death rate. Using CDC Wonder, a database of public health information, PolitiFact also checked the data for 2013, the last available year. In that time, 123 black children died of asthma compared to 83 white children. That corresponds to a death rate of 10.1 per million for black children and 1.5 per million for white children, which just about matches the 2010 numbers. The disparity for 2011 and 2012 was actually even greater, with the difference just about ten-fold. Why the racial disparity? According to the CDC, nobody is quite sure. "Reasons for disparities are not well understood and are the subject of research by numerous investigators in university research centers," says a statement from the agency’s Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch. However, there are studies that provide a couple of clues. For example, one examination of trends in preventive asthma medication use from 1988 to 2008 found that black and Mexican-American children were less likely to use the medication than white children. Another study from 1997 found that inner-city children are more likely to develop allergies as a result of prolonged exposure to cockroach allergens. Since minorities are more likely to live in urban areas, this may go some way toward explaining higher rates of asthma morbidity and mortality. Our ruling Clinton said, "African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids." According to a 2006 study from the CDC, she’s right. According to more recent data, she’s slightly off, but only because she has underestimated the gap: In reality, it appears that black children are seven to eight times as likely to die of asthma as white children. We rate her claim True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-11T13:18:59	2015-07-31	['None']
pomt-00042	Says he didn't support the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/mike-braun/does-mike-braun-support-lawsuit-end-obamacare/	Throughout the country, Democratic candidates are singing a common tune, warning that their Republican opponents want to end protections for pre-existing conditions. In Indiana, incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly recently accused his Republican challenger, Mike Bruan, of supporting the Texas lawsuit that aims to cancel Obamacare. This isn’t the first time Donnelly has made the claim, but this time, Braun had a chance to respond to it. In the second and final Indiana Senate debate, the three candidates — Donnelly, Braun, and Libertarian Lucy Brenton — said what they intended to do in order to keep health care insurance premiums affordable for middle- and lower-income families. In his response, Braun criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that it was "doomed to fail, because you had big government get in cahoots with big health care, specifically big health insurance." He stressed that he was opposed to any replacement of Obamacare that does not cover pre-existing conditions. Donnelly responded by saying, "What he said is not true. Mike supports a lawsuit that would end the Affordable Care Act, that would end pre-existing conditions. So all of you watching out there tonight, if you have someone in your family with diabetes, with arthritis, with asthma — their coverage goes away of Mike’s lawsuit is successful. As I said, that’s how important this is, those are the facts, and he can’t deny that." Braun, however, did deny that, and said, "As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case." He then pointed to his experience in the private sector, saying, "We have done things like health savings accounts, telemedicine where you can actually get healthcare when you’re on the road, transparency, consumer-driven. That’ll knock the cost down, because my policy costs one fourth of what his Obamacare policy costs. There’s no disputing that, and I’ve done that in the real world, he’s crafted something with big health care doomed to fail." Did Donnelly falsely assume that Braun, as a Republican, would support the lawsuit to end Obamacare? The lawsuit and what it might mean Donnelly was referring to a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas in February 2018 and backed by 18 attorney generals and two governors, all of whom are Republican. The basis for the Texas lawsuit is the individual mandate. While Obamacare essentially forced insurance companies to cover everyone, it also contained a mechanism to incentivize everyone to get coverage by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who were not insured. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to purchase health care, precisely because it was backed by a tax penalty. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the penalty on not having coverage to zero. This led a group of 20 states to challenge Obamacare in court again, arguing that as the individual mandate could not be enforced, the entire law had become unconstitutional. If the lawsuit is successful and the ACA is repealed, the regulations protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions will also be affected. Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, had previously told us, "There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome." Where Braun stands on the lawsuit Braun, who is not currently in office, has not made a lot of statements relating to the Texas lawsuit. When asked about the lawsuit in an interview to Politico, Braun said: "Sure, anything that’s going to actually get rid of it," he said of the ACA. "And then be ready to come back and talk about what you’re ready to do about pre-existing conditions and no limit coverage. That’s where you don’t hear much conservative talk." This quote essentially sums up Braun’s rather consistent position on health care: He supports coverage for pre-existing conditions, but maintains that they should guaranteed through market-based solutions, not government intervention. Politico, RTV (an Indianapolis ABC affiliate), Joe Donnelly and we here at PolitiFact have cited the Politico interview as a source on Braun’s position regarding the lawsuit. It seems that the candidate hasn’t made any other comments in support of it, but he hasn’t said anything to the contrary, either. Braun’s office told us that "Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them." While stressing Braun’s commitment for the maintaining protections for pre-existing conditions, his office did not address his position on the lawsuit. Our ruling Braun said, "As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case." Braun only seems to have made one comment with regard to the lawsuit to repeal the ACA, in which he said he supported it, but stressed his commitment to maintain protections for pre-existing conditions through other means. Those other means, though, are unspecified vague, so it’s hard to give him much credit. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Mike Braun	None	None	None	2018-11-05T11:16:46	2018-10-30	['None']
pomt-11310	"Singer Celine Dion Says: ‘I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country.’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/blog-posting/did-celine-dion-say-she-hates-country-no/	Canadian singer Celine Dion did not say she hates America, despite a hoax you might have seen online. An April 11 headline falsely quoted Dion as saying, "I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Dion said either of these things. The rumor originated on a clickbait website in September 2017, according to Snopes. The story doesn’t support the headline. Instead, it talks about how Dion turned down an offer to sing at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. In January 2017, news outlets such as TMZ reported that Dion passed up the opportunity, but not because she hates America. Dion was actually scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration, which we were able to confirm with an archived version of her 2017 schedule. After a few paragraphs repeating the same information, the story cuts to a YouTube video with a thumbnail of Dion. The 59-second video shares the same title as the blog post, but instead of Dion speaking, it’s actually just a computer voiceover, saying, "I can’t even look at an American flag anymore, I hate this country." Right after the "quote," however, the voice-over contradicts the previous statement. It says that Dion is one of the most talented vocalists that "ever existed." And although she is from Canada, her performance of God Bless America proves her "true appreciation of our amazing country." We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-06027	Federal law prohibits the growing of industrial hemp in the United States.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/suzanne-bonamici/cant-grow-hemp-united-states/	In response to a viewer question about marijuana, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici said: "Industrial hemp is something that right now is used in products and people with businesses right here in Oregon have to buy it from Canada because there’s a federal law that says it can’t be grown." We know that industrial hemp has been an issue in the Oregon Legislature. Didn’t the Senate pass something allowing farmers to grow hemp for food, health care products and clothing? Our hunch was right. In 2009, state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 676, which authorizes farmers to grow hemp, subject to regulation by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Oregon became the seventh state to do so, joining Maine and Hawaii. But we can’t grow industrial hemp yet because the federal government has yet to authorize it. "Until there is some change at the federal level, we are poised to begin the process of establishing rules for production," said Bruce Pokarney, spokesman for Oregon’s Agriculture Department. The federal government does not allow the growing of industrial hemp in the United States. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12733	Wisconsin children are crossing "condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/03/kathleen-vinehout/are-kids-rural-wisconsin-crossing-condemned-bridge/	Saying Wisconsin’s transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. "We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned," the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. "And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus." An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word "condemned," while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsin’s bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. In October 2015, we rated Mostly True a claim by La Crosse Democrat Jennifer Shilling, the state Senate minority leader, that 71 percent of Wisconsin’s roads were in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of its bridges were "structurally deficient or functionally obsolete." Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsin’s figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walker’s state budget proposal for 2017-’19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehout’s claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. "It’s scrap," he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered "condemned," Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment. The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing "condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus." Two bridges in Vinehout’s home county of Buffalo have been "condemned" in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Kathleen Vinehout	None	None	None	2017-03-03T05:00:00	2017-02-24	['None']
pomt-05232	Under Gov. Mitt Romney, Massachusetts ranked "47th in job creation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-repeats-claim-massachusetts-under-mi/	Over the weekend, the Obama campaign repeated a talking point it’s been making for at least a year. Obama adviser David Axelrod said on the June 3, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation that Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during Romney’s tenure as governor. He said something similar a year earlier during a CNN interview -- that "people have a right to say, why is it that your state was 47th in the country in job creation when you were governor?" Separately, we're checking the Romney camp’s rebuttal to Axelrod -- that year by year under Romney, the job growth rate in Massachusetts improved, from 51st in his first year in office to 30th in his final year. Who’s right? For both fact-checks, we'll follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much is the change because of Romney's policies? We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. We used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline. We found that from December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So the number is correct. Does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our rating It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, the Obama camp -- like the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. We rated Axelrod Half True a year ago, and today, we still think it merits a Half True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2012-06-05T18:17:20	2012-06-03	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-07104	"Most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things. ... 85 percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for delivery of service."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/22/ron-amstutz/state-rep-ron-amstutz-says-most-state-budget-spent/	Gov. John Kasich aimed to plug a projected $8 billion budget shortfall when he announced a two-year spending proposal including big cuts to education and local government. The budget cuts drew criticism from angry school officials, among others. The cuts and the anger also concerned state Rep. Ron Amstutz. As chairman of the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, the Wooster Republican had the job of steering the budget through the House. He called local governments "our partners," and he said changes would be made in the controversial blueprint for funding schools. But the veteran lawmaker said that cutting the size of state government was not an alternative that would cover the budget gap. "Most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things," he told a public forum at the Idea Center on Playhouse Square. Most of the budget, he said, goes to such recipients as school districts, local governments, school districts, hospitals, nursing homes and libraries. "The state doesn't do much direct service," Amstutz said. "Eighty-five percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for delivery of service." That's a hefty percentage. We asked Amstutz how it was figured. His office provided a budget overview for fiscal 2010 that was prepared by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission. A breakdown of spending shows that 85.6 percent of the spending in the General Revenue Fund, the primary operating fund of the state, goes to the category of "subsidies." The total for subsidies is about $20.7 billion of a total $24.1 billion. The Legislative Service Commission then provided us with a breakdown of that spending. Two departments account for nearly $17 billion. The Department of Job and Family Services, which handles Medicaid and unemployment compensation, tops the list with about $9.2 billion. The Department of Education, for grades K-12, is budgeted at $7.6 billion. Amstutz told us he was referring to the General Revenue Fund because it’s money over which the General Assembly has control. In the larger all funds budget, which is less discretionary and includes agencies funded completely by fees and federal money, subsidies account for 66 percent of spending, Amstutz said. A breakdown of the all-funds budget in the Legislative Service Commission report puts subsidies at 66.6 percent of the $55.87 billion in spending for Fiscal 2010. That's still two-thirds of the total, or most of it. So how does Amstutz’ claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter? Amstutz said that most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things and that 85 percent of the money goes back to local communities for services. When we talked to Amstutz and he mentioned the 85 percent figure and specifically referred to the general revenue fund. The budget overview prepared by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission shows he’s right on the money with that figure. So Amstutz’ statement is essentially accurate. Also to be considered is the all-funds budget. The percentage of money that goes back to communities is smaller, about 67 percent, but it still matches the description of "most" that he used at the Ideastream forum. That’s a piece of additional information that provides full understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, Amstutz' statement rates as Mostly True.

pomt-08959	House Republicans who complained they didn't have enough time to consider a constitutional ban against oil drilling "shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/21/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-house-gop-rushed-through-pro-oil-dr/	The July 20, 2010, special session to consider a constitutional amendment banning oil drilling in state-controlled waters was full of drama and political theatrics, but ultimately little action. The session came and went in about two hours with the Republican-controlled House and Senate failing to even consider adding anti-drilling language to the November ballot. The House voted along party lines 67-44 to adjourn the session without action. The Senate voted 18-16 to adjourn. None of it, however, stopped political leaders from both major parties, and independent Gov. Charlie Crist, from trying to score political points. Among the near-constant volleys of accusations, name-calling and bickering, we found a statement from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink particularly interesting. Speaking to reporters before the Legislature convened the noon session, Sink launched a pre-emptive attack against GOP legislators. "Today at noon, I expect to see the culmination of the complete failure of the Florida Legislature to be in tune with what's going on the real world of Florida," said Sink, a Democrat who is running for governor. "In the same chamber, where House Republicans shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling, those same Republicans will stand at their desks to claim they don't have enough time." During the 51 minutes of House debate before legislators adjourned, we heard from several Republicans about the need to deliberately and methodically consider the impacts of an oil drilling ban. House Speaker Larry Cretul, for instance, suggested the Legislature should consider whether to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2012 -- in the calm after the crisis. "The fact remains that (Crist) has called us here at the last possible moment to consider a constitutional amendment for which he never proposed any language, and permitted far too little time for reflection and review," Cretul said. "This is a terrible way to propose constitutional changes." Was, as Sink suggested, that same line-of-thinking absent when legislators considered a proposal to allow drilling in state waters? Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings pointed us to the House's oil drilling legislation in 2009 as proof. That year, state Rep. Dean Cannon -- who is set to become Speaker -- filed a bill that would allow the governor and cabinet to award oil and natural gas leases in state waters between three and 10 miles offshore. The bill passed the House 70-43 but stalled in the Senate. From soup to nuts, how long did it take House legislators to consider and approve the measure? The state keeps a thorough log that follows the progress of legislation. PolitiFact Florida went back to track HB 1219, the Cannon oil drilling bill. The bill originally was filed on Feb. 26, 2009, but that's misleading. The original bill only asked the Department of Environmental Protection to develop a plan for the implementation of an oil and natural gas drilling program. Cannon, of Winter Park, didn't unveil the final oil drilling language until April 20 (a Monday night), hours before it was scheduled to be considered by a House Policy Council. The Orlando Sentinel called Cannon's language a "surprise," when it was introduced. The Pensacola News-Journal reported that it "caught opponents off guard." In an editorial, the St. Petersburg Times called the act a "shameful" oil drilling ploy. The language, which was supported by oil drilling proponents such as the Associated Industries of Florida, passed out of the Policy Council 17-7. It was sent to the House floor the next day, a Wednesday. From the Times editorial: "Cannon sprang the radical idea to allow oil rigs within 3 miles of the coast in the eighth week of a nine-week legislative session. And he did it even as the House has failed to consider the governor's plan to foster renewable energy. Florida needs more than 10 days to consider changing a law that has protected its shores for decades, and the Senate and governor should reject it. "Clearly, Associated Industries of Florida has been working with Cannon for weeks to try to reverse a 20-year drilling ban -- though Cannon unveiled it just 12 hours before it passed a House council Tuesday. A pollster hired to do a survey, an industry expert from Texas and an Orlando economist touting potential revenue all testified. Cannon contended HB 1219 is merely an attempt 'to have a mature, thoughtful conversation about what we want to do about this.' So why is the public just now hearing about it?" Once on the House floor, HB 1219 was read three times as required. The first reading came on April 22 (a Wednesday), the second on April 24 (a Friday). The bill was read a third time, and amendments were considered on April 27 (the following Monday). The bill passed at 4:40 p.m. We should make clear that the Cannon legislation didn't directly allow oil and natural gas exploration in Florida waters; rather, it permitted the governor and cabinet to allow drilling. Another step would have been required. Regardless, the bill language was first made public on a Monday night and initially looked at by legislators the next morning. It passed the the following Monday. Total time in the hopper: Five working days. The special session to consider the oil drilling constitutional amendment was scheduled to last four days. Of course, it lasted just a few hours. In chastising Republican lawmakers, state CFO Alex Sink said the House "shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling." It took House lawmakers just five working days from first seeing the bill to passing it. We rate Sink's statement True.

pomt-08580	A defense bill "includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/27/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-annual-defense-authorization-/	Republican senators, including John Cornyn of Texas, last week charged Democrats with tacking politically-loaded amendments onto a defense bill. In a Sept. 21 press release announcing his decision to vote against a motion to take up the bill, Cornyn accused the body's majority party of attaching "language to the bill that represents a blatant attempt to score last-minute votes just weeks before an election. The bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand." The motion failed after a 56-43 vote that same day. We wondered later if indeed language attached by Democrats would require military hospitals to provide abortions "on demand." First, some background: The Department of Defense is barred from spending federal funds to perform abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. The only other instances that abortions can be performed in military facilities are in cases of rape or incest, though the woman must pay for the procedure herself. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a memorandum allowing abortions at military facilities if they were paid for with private funds, according to a 2002 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. In 1996, Republicans, who then controlled Congress, imposed the current limits, in that year's version of the defense authorization bill. It has stood ever since. The law affects some 200,000 active-duty female personnel, according to the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. Heather Boonstra, a senior policy analyst at the Institute, told us that about 50,000 servicewomen are stationed overseas. How did the new language per the abortion limits emerge? In May, Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., introduced an amendment to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011. Burris' amendment, adopted by a Senate committee, would repeal the restrictions on privately-funded abortions in military facilities. Burris said in a May 27 press release: "It is critical that we provide the highest quality care for our service members while they are serving our nation overseas, and that includes allowing women and their families the right to choose at facilities operated under the Department of Defense." Jim O'Connor, a spokesman for Burris, told us the amendment "removes language prohibiting these health services from being offered on military bases, nothing more," he said. "It does not compel doctors to perform these procedures." Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, applauded the amendment at the time, saying: "The (committee) vote repealing this discriminatory and dangerous ban is the first step to ensuring that servicewomen can use their own private money for abortion care when they are serving overseas." So, under the amendment, it appears military hospitals would be permitted to perform abortions in more cases than currently allowed. But Boonstra objected to Cornyn's statement that the amendment "requires" military hospitals to provide abortions. "What it does is lift a ban on military hospitals to perform abortions," she said. "Nothing compels a military hospital or facility to do that. ... The idea that military hospitals would have to set up special mechanisms to provide these abortions just isn't the case." Kevin McLaughlin, Cornyn's spokesman, pointed to a White House statement supporting the amendment, which it said "would restore a policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents — including nearly 50,000 servicewomen stationed overseas — have the ability to obtain abortion services using their own, private funds." However, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that the amendment "does not require military facilities to provide abortions." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states that the changes that Clinton ordered allowing abortions in military hospitals "did not necessarily have the effect of greatly increasing access to abortion services. Abortions are generally not performed at military medical facilities in the continental United States." Further, the report notes that few abortions had been performed abroad because the "military follows the prevailing laws and rules of foreign countries regarding abortion" and because "the military has had a difficult time finding health care professional in uniform willing to perform the procedure." Next, we turned to the second part of Cornyn's statement. Would servicewomen get abortions "on demand," as Cornyn puts it? McLaughlin said the senator means there would be "no questions asked" as opposed to current policy which restricts abortion procedures to women who are pregnant as a result of rape, incest or if her life would be endangered if she carried the pregnancy to term. Others have suggested that if the amendment passes into law, abortions wouldn't always be available. In a September article published in the Guttmacher Policy Review, Rachel Natelson, the legal and policy adviser at Service Women's Action Network, which advocates for military women, is quoted saying: "Even if the amendment were adopted, the longstanding ban on the use of federal funds for abortion at military facilities would remain. And for military women stationed overseas who rely on the government for their health care, access to abortion services would remain significantly challenged." Boonstra, who wrote the article, told us the military has a "conscience clause" that allows physicians to refuse to perform abortions if they have a moral objection. In late 2008, the Bush administration issued a rule stating that federally-funded health workers could decline to perform an abortion or any health care practice that encroaches on that person's "religious belief or moral conviction." Opponents said the regulation was so broad that doctors could refuse any treatment. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a May 28 news conference that the Burris amendment means abortions "have got to be prepaid" out of pocket and would be "only done on a voluntary basis by a doctor. There is no requirement, in other words, that doctors in military hospitals perform the abortions." Where does that leave us? The defense bill stalled before the Senate includes language allowing military hospitals to provide abortions in cases beyond the existing permissible instances of rape, incest or when the mother's life is endangered. But allowing is not the same as requiring. Contrary to Cornyn's claim, we see no mandate in the proposed change. As for military hospitals performing abortions "on demand," there are so many conditions on availability — even with the amendment — that Cornyn's description goes too far. We find the statement False.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-09-27T06:00:00	2010-09-21	['None']
pomt-03930	If the sequester hits, "hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-would-cut-vaccinations/	In a recent speech, President Barack Obama said that key health programs will be cut if the sequester -- an across-the-board federal spending cut -- takes effect as scheduled on March 1, 2013. "Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings," Obama said. We wondered if his dire claim was accurate. First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program. When we asked about looming cuts to immunization and cancer screening, administration officials pointed us to a report released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. The report sought to quantify cuts in a variety of programs overseen by the committee. We should note that the report was released by the subcommittee’s Democratic majority, chaired by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is generally an ally of the president. The report addresses possible cuts to two programs relevant to Obama’s claim. One, the Section 317 immunization program, is a grant program to states and cities, providing vaccines to underinsured children and adults. According to the subcommittee, it would serve 211,958 fewer children if the sequester takes effect. The other is the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which aids underserved women nationwide. A sequester would leave 33,816 fewer women screened for breast and cervical cancer, according to the subcommittee’s estimate. So, combined, these two programs by themselves would affect nearly 246,000 people. But it's important to note that Obama's language was imprecise enough to suggest that people may lose their access to primary care doctors outright, which would be a much broader hit than cutbacks to flu shots and cancer screenings. There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester; Medicaid, to cite just one example, is spared from cuts entirely. But Obama's phrasing could leave a different impression. Meanwhile, a few factors could make the estimate for immunization and cervical screening too high. The subcommittee’s report was issued in July 2012 using an estimated 7.8 percent cut, a bigger reduction than the 5.3 percent cut now envisioned for domestic discretionary programs. In addition, a CDC spokesman confirmed that the vaccine and cancer-screening programs are counted as individual "programs," meaning that each will each need to be cut by the uniform amount. However, federal managers will have some room for juggling spending priorities within each program -- moves that could decrease the number of people affected. In addition, these two programs are grants to states, and state (or local) officials would have a say in how to spend the money. Still, the room for either federal, state or local officials to maneuver would likely be pretty limited. And there’s also reason to believe the numbers of people affected could be even higher, since this estimate doesn’t include additional programs at risk of cuts, such as the CDC’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said he has a problem with all "doomsday scenarios" like the one that Obama (and Harkin) are promoting, because they amount to a "straw man" that "fails to point to the simple solution -- to give agencies flexibility but keep the cuts in place." Still, Ellis said he considers the subcommittee’s calculations reasonable given the information Harkin had available. Our ruling Obama said that if the sequester hits, "hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings." Obama's words could have left the impression that primary care services overall will be lost, rather than flu shots or cancer screenings alone. Still, we found that one widely cited estimate found that sequester cuts to two programs alone would leave 246,000 people without the types of services Obama mentioned. There’s a lot of uncertainty about these numbers for a variety of reasons, meaning the actual number could be lower or higher. But even at the low end, it’s pretty close to "hundreds of thousands." So we rate the claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-21T16:56:19	2013-02-19	['United_States']
pomt-05875	A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would permit school districts "to shave 5 full weeks off the school year."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/09/marc-schare/could-ohio-schools-really-cut-five-weeks-classes-u/	Imagine if Ohio's lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer lasted longer. Now imagine that a vote of the General Assembly could make it happen. That, in a sense, is the idea behind House Bill 191 -- at least for Ohio schools. The legislation would delay the start of the school year until Labor Day and end it before Memorial Day. It also would change the formula for figuring a minimum school year. Now districts are required to schedule 182 days. The legislation would change that to require schools be in session 910 hours, for kindergarten through grade 6, and 1,001 hours for grades 7 through 12. Rep. Bill Patmon, a Cleveland Democrat, co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Bill Hayes, a Republican from Licking County, east of Columbus. Hayes told The Columbus Dispatch the primary intent of a longer summer break was to help tourism and recreation, the state's third-largest industry -- "and also generate revenue for the state, part of which gets passed down to the school." Representatives of the Ohio School Boards Association, the Ohio Association of School Business Officials and a local school district testified against HB 191 before the House Education Committee on Feb. 1. Marc Schare of the Worthington Board of Education, which passed a resolution asking the General Assembly and Gov. Kasich to reject the bill, said it would "cause a significant reduction to the quality of education" in Ohio. He said that would allow Worthington schools to reduce the number of days to 151 from the current 178. "You are essentially allowing us to shave five full weeks off the school year," Schare said. PolitiFact Ohio feared for the integrity of the space-time continuum. We wondered how starting classes after Labor Day would trim the school year more than a month -- especially after Hayes claimed the bill could lengthen the year in "many districts." We called Schare. He explained his reasoning and pointed us to the more detailed testimony posted on his website. First, he noted, HB 191 converts the minimum school year from days to hours using a 5.5 hours for a standard secondary-school day, excluding lunch. That works out to a minimum school year of 979 hours, or 178 days. (The minimum year of 182 days -- or 1,001 hours at 5.5 hours per day -- includes days when classes aren't in session because of parent-teacher conferences or professional programs.) In his district of Worthington, Schare said, the school day at the secondary level is 6.5 hours. A chart from The Columbus Dispatch that he posted online with his testimony shows that most of the districts in Central Ohio have similar school days. "This means that in a typical year, under this legislation, we would be in school 178 hours above the minimum, which works out to around 27 days," he said. "In other words, this legislation is giving Worthington carte blanche to reduce the number of days in our school district calendar from 178 to 151 days. "Running the calculation another way for clarity, if we take the minimum number of hours -- 979 -- and divide it by our school day length of 6.5, we get 150 and change. "You are," he concluded, "essentially permitting us to shave 5 full weeks off the school year." Schare said his larger concern is that districts would start dropping days off the school year. "Virtually every district is at the minimum days now," he told the committee. "Eventually they would get there (to a new, shorter minimum) through collective bargaining or because of financial constraints." He pointed to the experience of Michigan, which in 2003 replaced a 180-day minimum school year with a 1,098-hour requirement. Even though that level is nearly 10 percent higher than the one in HB 191, 98 percent of Michigan's districts shortened the school year within three years. To stop the erosion, Michigan's legislature last year set a new minimum -- of just 165 days. We won’t speculate whether that would indeed happen in Ohio. HB 191 has not yet even cleared the Ohio House, let alone win Senate passage and the governor’s signature. And knowing how schools would then react would require the ability to predict the future. As for Schare's claim about what the bill would allow, his calculations check out. While the numbers he used apply specifically to his Worthington district, he shows in his posted testimony that most districts in central Ohio would feel similar results. Regardless, in the statement we're checking, Schare said only that HB 191 would permit the 5-week shorter year, not require it. On the Truth-O-Meter, Schare's statement rates True.

pomt-03020	Amanda Murphy has "two vacation homes around the world."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/12/citizens-fairness/campaign-mailer-says-amanda-murphy-has-two-vacatio/	The race to succeed Mike Fasano in the state House is producing a glut of attack ads, including two recent mailers that stand out. One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her "Cancun vacation home." The other says Republican Bill Gunter would "drain millions" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad claiming that Murphy has two vacation homes. (We'll look at the attack on Gunter's views on public education in a separate fact-check.) The ad attacking Murphy is personal in tone. Above a picture of a beach dotted with cabanas overlooking crystal-blue water, it says: "Amanda Murphy: Out to lunch — at her Cancun vacation home." It continues: "It's bad enough we can't trust Amanda Murphy with our money, but with two vacation homes around the world, can Amanda Murphy really relate to the challenges we face?" Like the other ad, it showed up in mailboxes a couple of weeks ago. Citizens for Fairness, an electioneering communications organization based in Melbourne, produced the ad. Efforts to reach the group's chairperson, Carmella K. Falcone, were unsuccessful. We can't rate whether Murphy is trustworthy "with our money" on the Truth-O-Meter, but voters may find her financial disclosures informative. State Division of Elections reports indicate she earned $176,047 last year as an investment adviser at Raymond James Financial. She earns well more than the average Pasco resident. Her income is roughly three times higher than the $51,000 median family income in Pasco, according to U.S. Census data. Her biggest asset is her house in New Port Richey, valued at $157,480. Based on August sales data, her home is worth about 65 percent more than the average New Port Richey home valued at about $95,000. Here's where the ad veers from the truth: Murphy's net worth is listed as $243,817 and includes a $12,900 timeshare in a Cocoa Beach condominium and half a timeshare worth $7,362 in a condo in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico's Baja California peninsula. A time share — which typically entitles the owner to a week or two of use of the space each year — is hardly comparable to owning a second (or third) home in a pricey vacation spot. So the claim she has "two vacation homes around the world," including in Cancun, is misleading. It suggests Murphy owns the homes when in fact she owns a time share in a Florida condo and half a share in a condo in Cabo San Lucas — not in Cancun, which is on the Yucatán Peninsula about 1,480 miles to the east. Elsewhere, the ad calls Murphy a "Wall Street broker," suggesting she works among the financial giants far removed the problems of Pasco voters. It's true Raymond James is a brokerage, but it's a regional brokerage based in St. Petersburg, not in New York City. Murphy works out of the company's Tampa office. The ad attempts to portray Murphy as an out-of-touch millionaire but uses flimsy evidence to support that picture. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13753	"I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’"	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/23/hillary-clinton/clinton-wrongly-says-she-was-only-one-primaries-ni/	Hillary Clinton came to Virginia recently, promising to expand early childhood education programs, make community colleges free and ensure that students can go to universities without assuming debt. "People say to me, ‘OK, well how are you going to pay for it?’" she said during a July 14 rally at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. "Well, we’re going to go where the money is. That means we’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy and those who can afford to pay." " ... But I’ll tell you this," she added. "I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’ And I mean that, and I won’t do it." Clinton began making that promise last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year. We wondered whether she was, in fact, the only candidate in the heavily populated Democratic and Republican presidential primary fields to make a no-tax-hike pledge to the middle class. We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone - including the middle class. Twelve of them last year signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses" and "any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." Last year’s 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore, George Pataki and Rick Perry. A 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath last year to oppose all tax increases. Two other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform’s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker. So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges - not just the middle class but everyone. Who were the two resisters? •Donald Trump, the ultimate GOP nominee, who said last year he didn’t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he "may want to switch taxes around." The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington says that Trump’s proposals would cut federal levies on the middle one-fifth of taxpayers by 4.9 percent. •Jeb Bush, who said he objects to written pledges. We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty. We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class. We asked Clinton’s for an explanation of Clinton’s claim and got a generic response. "Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email. Our ruling Clinton said, "I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’" Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other three inked such a pledge earlier in their careers.

pomt-04091	The state budget proposal has been submitted "on time and [it's] the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/18/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-he-submitted-/	Just 16 days into the new year, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went before the General Assembly to offer his third State of the State address and talk about his proposed $8.2-billion 2013-2014 budget. Earlier in the day he released details of his budget package to the media and by the next day, his complete budget had been posted online. During his Jan. 16 speech to members of the House and Senate, Chafee declared, "I submit this budget to the General Assembly on Jan. 16th – on time and the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades." State law requires governors to submit their budgets to the legislature by the third Thursday in January (or the first Thursday in February if it's their first year in office). Chafee beat that deadline by one day. Submitting a budget early sounds like a good thing. At a briefing for reporters, Chafee’s director of administration, Richard Licht, said the early submittal reflected the discipline the governor has tried to bring to the whole budget process. And it will give the General Assembly more time to analyze it properly. We wondered whether Chafee's claim that his budget is the earliest to be submitted in more than two decades was true. We called his office to ask for their evidence. Meanwhile, we turned to the always-helpful Thomas Evans, the state librarian. Evans doesn't keep track of when a governor's budget is released, but he had data for when governors gave their State of the State/budget addresses and when their proposed budgets were submitted as legislation. It turns out, there can be a big gap between the two. For example, in 1989, the second year on Evans' list, Gov. Edward DiPrete addressed the General Assembly on Jan. 4, yet his budget bill wasn't introduced until March 1. In the previous 25 years, no governor has submitted a budget bill by the original deadline set by state law, according to Evans' data. (Extensions were written into the law for budgets submitted from 2005-2007 and for 2011 and 2012). Usually submission comes sometime in February. In eight years it was in March and in one year -- 1991 when Gov. Bruce Sundlun was dealing with the banking crisis -- it came April 9. We confirmed Evans’ dates using The Journal's archives and found that details of the budget are usually released a day or two before the budget bill is introduced. "The earliest the budget bill itself has been submitted in the last 25 years is Feb. 1," said Evans. That was in 2005 and 2007 (during the administration of Gov. Donald Carcieri) and 2012 (Chafee's second year). Chafee's budget bill is on his website and Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger said it has been sent to the House. However, it has not been officially introduced and referred to a committee for analysis. Said Hunsinger: "We hope they will introduce it Tuesday," That would be Jan. 22, still ten days earlier than the previous record. We rate Chafee's claim True.

pomt-08565	Says Daniel Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/28/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-opponent-wants-make-divorce-ille/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as "die quickly" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? "Taliban Daniel Webster." The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript: Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) "Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida." Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) "Wives submit yourself to your own husband." Female narrator: "Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us." Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: "You should submit to me. That's in the Bible." Female narrator: "Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "He wants to force raped women to bear the child." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws." The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that "Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: "SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990)." So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, "creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery." Florida law currently allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is "irretrievably broken." It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary "covenant marriage." Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring: "I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me." The covenant marriage agreement "may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery," according to the bill Webster filed. "A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted," HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that "no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife," but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the "original" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was "significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.," Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad "Taliban Dan Webster," Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim, we rate it Half True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-09-28T14:39:26	2010-09-25	['None']
pomt-06534	Say water fluoridation started in Nazi Germany ghettos and death camps to pacify the Jews.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/	Here's a reason to support a Florida county's decision to cut fluoride out of its drinking water: The idea came from the Nazis. The Nazis put fluoride in water to pacify Jews during World War II, a local resident told members of the Pinellas County Commission on Oct. 4, 2011, before the commission voted 4-3 vote to stop fluoridating water for about 700,000 residents. "History shows, actually, that in Nazi Germany, one of the first things that they did was add fluoride to the water in the ghettos where the Jews stayed," Matt Leffler of Clearwater said. Once the St. Petersburg Times published its story about the decision — similar, anonymous comments on the Web piled up: "Do you guys know where water fluoridation started? In the death camps in WWII." "There have been many links to cancer going back to the original tests on fluoride done by the Nazis on the Jews." "It IS what they used to dull their brains!! They used it in the concentration camps. It was in the concentration camps that they also developed many anti-psychotics." One reader declared the Nazi-fluoride connection "an absolute historical fact." Several readers linked to sources on the Web. Certainly Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. So PolitiFact Florida had to know: Did that include adding fluoride to water? We tracked down roots of these claims on the Web, reached out to Holocaust historians, contacted well-known critics of water fluoridation, and read book excerpts and magazine articles and news stories. And we can tell you: There's no teeth to this claim. This fact-check won't explore the pros and cons of fluoride in your drinking water — though we will note the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the practice one of the greatest public health achievements of the century. And also that groups of citizens, scientists among them, have been wary of the practice since the 1950s. We'll focus instead on an Internet meme that's crept into the local public debate over drinking water — one that well-known fluoridation critics would like to see washed away. "We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument," said Paul Connett, a chemist who directs the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Network and recently co-authored a book called The Case Against Fluoride. "The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum." • • • So where does the story come from? Andy Hollinger, who handles media relations at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, tried not to laugh as we explained our fact-check. "I can almost guarantee you that is indeed an urban myth," he said. "... That sounds like Conspiracy Theory 101." But he humored us, putting historian Patricia Heberer on the phone. Her expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation. Most Nazi medical experiments, she said, had two themes: new drugs and treatments for common battlefield ailments, from war wounds to typhus, or the more infamous effort to underpin Nazi racial ideas, such as Josef Mengele's twin studies. None of the experimentation that she knows of involved fluoride — for mind control or for healthy teeth. Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus — in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, water treated just for the Jews? "I can't see it," she said. But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn't about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists. • • • Still, do an Internet search for "fluoride" and "Nazis," and you'll find articles such as "Nazi Connections to Fluoride in America's Drinking Water." The text appears on various sites, and includes the citations "Stephen 1995," and "Bryson 2004." "Stephen 1995" is likely Ian E. Stephens, author of a 1987 self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in Nexus Magazine in 1995. We tracked down a copy of the article from the magazine's website, an alternative Australian publication covering "health breakthroughs, future science and technology, suppressed news, free energy, religious revisionism, conspiracy, the environment, history and ancient mysteries, the mind, UFOs, paranormal and the unexplained." It's called "Fluoridation: Mind Control of the Masses?" And in it we meet government research worker Charles Eliot Perkins, who at the end of World War II purportedly learned from a big German chemical producer that it had developed a plan to fluoridate occupied countries. "Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him," says a document quoted in the excerpt. "Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile." "Bryson 2004" is Christopher Bryson, an investigative reporter and television producer who reported on Guatemalan human rights abuses for the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and the Atlanta Journal Constitution in the 1980s, and later wrote a book called The Fluoride Deception. It delves into murky connections between military-industrial fluoride polluters and the early push for public water fluoridation. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism less than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation. We contacted him. "I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps," he said. • • • In 2009, two scientists published a book called The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America's Longest Running Political Melodrama. The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of them. "The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie," said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described "boring science books for scientists." The Fluoride Wars instead presents a lively social history of the fluoridation debate in the United States. And it starts with the first large-scale fluoridation in history, not in Europe, but in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1945. • • • Given the topic, it seems appropriate to conclude with Wikipedia, where we found mention of Nazis and fluoride — in an article listing conspiracy theories: Fluoridation is alternately part of a "Communist, Fascist or New World Order or Illuminati plot to take over the world." It was "pioneered by a German chemical company to make people submissive to those in power." It was "used in Russian prison camps and produces schizophrenia." Our Holocaust historian knew of no such project. Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication. So we can confidently declare this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Critics of water fluoridation	None	None	None	2011-10-06T18:48:24	2011-10-04	['Jews', 'Germany']
pomt-13183	"We have almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/oct/26/nathan-deal/deal-close-numbers-about-failing-schools/	With early voting already underway, Georgia voters have an important decision to make besides president. A proposal, called Amendment 1, would allow the state to take over schools considered "chronically failing." Gov. Nathan Deal has led the charge to pass the statewide proposal, which has drawn criticism from community leaders and professional educators. At a recent education conference in Atlanta, Deal said, "We have almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school." PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. We found the numbers are a little more complicated than they may seem. The Data An October poll showed likely voters siding nearly 2-1 against Amendment 1. Last month, a class-action lawsuit was filed against proponents of the bill, including Deal, over the language in the "Opportunity School District" ballot question. We reached out to Deal’s office and his spokesperson, Jen Talaber Ryan, sent us a PDF with the schools included on the chronically failing list, with the majority of the schools in the metro Atlanta area. Thing is, several of the schools included on the list, which was last updated in May, have closed or been consolidated this school year for a number of reasons. Deal says 68,000 students are required by law to attend a failing school. Students are in fact zoned for these schools, but options for private schools, charter schools and homeschooling exist. The 68,000 number is a sum of the enrollment at the near 130 schools eligible, as of May, to be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. (The maximum number of schools that could be in the district is 100.) The number is based off of last school year’s enrollment, but fails to account for about a dozen schools that closed or consolidated at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. In an email, GOSA spokesperson Martha Ann Todd said the total number of schools and enrollment for this school year would not be available until December. The amendment will be voted on in the Nov. 8 general election. A rough comparison of numbers by PolitiFact Georgia suggests a few thousand students would be unaffected by the takeover because their schools no longer exist. The issue Georgia schools have long been a contentious issue. About 60 percent of Georgia public school students are eligible for free and reduced lunch, a poverty measure used by the state department of education. This proposal would affect about 4 percent of Georgia public school students. Most OSD-eligible schools have more than 35 percent of students living in poverty. Deal has set out to reform poorly performing schools through this new district headed by a governor-appointed superintendent. Last year, the Republican-led Georgia Assembly passed a bill outlining the takeover of schools if they score below a number set by GOSA on a scale. Georgia uses the College & Career-Ready Performance Index, a 0-110 rating scale, to measure school performance. CCRPI uses standardized test scores, attendance, graduation rates and other measures to gauge academic proficiency. GOSA said scoring below a 60 is failing. Schools scoring below 60 three years in a row are "chronically failing," and therefore could be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. The lawsuit, filed by a parent, a reverend and a teacher, against Deal, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp calls the language in the ballot question is "misleading" and alleges there is no research to back up creation of a state-run district. Though some of these gains are limited, the opponents’ suit also says, "the language describes the targeted schools as ‘failing’ while many of them have made as much or more progress on state school assessments as traditionally high performing schools." Our Ruling Deal said there are, "almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school." We ran the numbers -- and he’s right. There are about 68,000 students in these failing schools. But his administration sets the standard, its numbers are out of date and there are other options. Opponents also claim some of these "chronically failing" schools have made gains in recent years. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06273	"We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hezbollah-latin-america-poses-imm/	Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, asked during a Republican presidential debate in Washington to suggest an important national security issue that isn't getting enough attention, said Islamic terror group Hezbollah is "working throughout Latin America," including Mexico, "which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." He wasn't the only one raising concern about the radical Shiite Muslim group's activity in Latin America at the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum talked about "radical Islamists" joining with "militant socialists" in Central and South America. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said, "We know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States." We wondered: Was Romney right? Is the Lebanon-based group linked to the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in 1983 networking just south of our border? The issue came up with a question from a visiting fellow from the American Enterprise Institute, one of the sponsors of the debate. "My question has to do with the unexpected," he said. "During the 2000 presidential debates, Gov. George W. Bush was never asked about the threat from al-Qaida, yet the battle with al-Qaida dominated his presidency. What national security issue do you worry about that nobody is asking about, either here or in any of the debates so far?" When it was Romney's turn to answer, he said: "Rick (Santorum), in my view, is right with regards to long-term security interests, and that's -- and that's China, although that's very much on our agenda. "Immediately, the most significant threat is, of course, Iran becoming nuclear. "But I happen to think Sen. Santorum is right with regards to the issue that doesn't get enough attention. That's the one that may come up that we haven't thought about, which is Latin America. Because, in fact, congressman, we have been attacked. We were attacked on 9/11. There have been dozens of attacks that have been thwarted by our -- by our security forces. And we have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." Romney and Perry's campaigns each gave us the same source for their comments: An eight-page American Enterprise Institute paper from October 2011, "The Mounting Hezbollah Threat in Latin America." It begins: "Over the last several years Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran have greatly expanded their operations in Latin America to the detriment of inter-American security and U.S. strategic interests. Today, Hezbollah is using the Western Hemisphere as a staging ground, fundraising center, and operational base to wage asymmetric warfare against the United States. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and other anti-American governments in the region have facilitated this expansion by rolling out the welcome mats for Hezbollah and Iran." But we spent a day digging into the claim and found the support was pretty flimsy. The paper actually provides little evidence that operational cells for Hezbollah are truly active in Mexico and Latin America. It says Hezbollah uses the region to raise money that is channeled back to Lebanon. The strongest evidence for Hezbollah fundraising, money-laundering and other "terrorist-related" activities in Latin America dates from the mid 1980s, when the group began using as a haven the tri-border area beween Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. A March 2010 Congressional Research Service report has also noted Hezbollah's presence there — where it reportedly profited from music piracy operations — along with groups such as Hamas, the Chinese Triads and Korean and Taiwanese syndicates. But the report, "International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, U.S. Policy, and Considerations for Congress," focuses primarily on the group's fundraising in the Western hemisphere — not operational support for the group. While millions of dollars are channeled back to Lebanon every year by criminal enterprises, those operations aren't typically owned or operated by Hezbollah members, the report says. Instead, the criminals are donors who support the group for religious, ideological or personal reasons. But activity that "poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America," as Romney said? On that point, the report is significantly more measured: "It is important to note that while these criminal sympathizers do not directly participate in or provide operational support for Hezbollah’s terrorist activity, that potential exists, security experts believe. If the organization decided to attack U.S. or Israeli interests in West Africa or South America, it is possible that these sympathizers could play a concrete role." Romney wasn't just talking about Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. In fact, he singled out Venezuela and Mexico. On Venezuela, the AEI paper sounds a stronger alarm -- even though it offers relatively little solid evidence to justify the strong language. Discussing the "mounting Hezbollah threat," it says that Hezbollah acts as a proxy for Iran, and thus a developing alliance between Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has meant a new safe haven for the Islamic group. Research by the paper's authors, Roger Noriega and Jose Cardenas, identify "at least two parallel yet collaborative terrorist networks" growing in Latin America, primarily in Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. They cite "open sources, subject-matter experts, and sensitive sources within various governments," but don't footnote this section of the paper. One is "operated by Hezbollah and aided by its collaborators" and the other "is managed by the Qods Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps." One pair of Lebanese brothers, the Nessereddines, reportedly launders money and has business dealings with Hezbollah and operates a paramilitary training camp on Margarita Island. A parallel recruiting network is overseen by Hojjat al-Eslam Mohsen Rabban, "the Terrorist Professor," described as the mastermind behind two attacks on Jewish targets in Buenos Aires in the early '90s that killed 144 people. "Despite being the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, Rabbani reportedly still operates in the region, traveling under false papers and connecting with his former disciples," the paper says. Then there's Mexico. "The immediate U.S. national security concern related to Hezbollah activity in Latin America is Mexico, where the terrorist group has ready access to the U.S. border," the paper says. "Principal Hezbollah activities there include human smuggling and narcotics trafficking. ... While there certainly have been no reported cases of Hezbollah smuggling operatives across the border to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States, it is neither 'sensationalist' nor 'alarmist' to be concerned about it and respond with appropriate policy measures." We reached out to Roger Noriega, one of the paper's authors and a former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs under the Bush administration. Did Romney accurate characterize his work? "I think he and Rick Santorum had it right," he said. But he acknowledged the Mexico evidence was thin. "You will see that we focus on South America, not on Mexico, so references that others made to 'Hezbollah in Mexico' are more speculative and not yet confirmed," he said. Indeed, evidence in the Mexico section of the paper includes Hezbollah supporters picked up in the United States after traveling through Mexico and a Washington Times article from March 2009 that relied largely on unnamed sources. Then it ventures into the realm of a Tuscon (Arizona) Police Department memo "leaked by an Internet hacker group," that itself relies on secondary sources including the Examiner and Wikipedia. We looked for additional support for the idea of a "significant and imminent threat" to the United States posed by Hezbollah in Latin America. In 2008 speeches, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff mentioned Hezbollah's "presence" and "tentacles" that "reach across the globe," including in South America. "It also has a presence elsewhere in the world, including in South America, our own western hemisphere, where you'll remember some time back they actually carried out an operation against a Jewish facility in South America," he told the National Press Club. But his language wasn't as pointed as Romney's. A more recent report from the State Department report on the subject, "Country Reports on Terrorism 2010," published in August 2011, doesn't support Romney's claim. It says Islamic terror groups' Latin American involvement focuses on fundraising, not carrying out terrorist plots. "There were no known operational cells of either al-Qaida- or Hezbollah-related groups in the hemisphere," the report says, "although ideological sympathizers in South America and the Caribbean continued to provide financial and moral support to these and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia." We found other experts who have studied terrorism in the region who say the talk of Hezbollah in Latin America is overblown. Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution, who testified in 2009 for the House subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on illicit economies, organized crime, and their impact on U.S. and global security, said, "Allegations of al-Qaida, Hamas, and Hezbollah contacts with the FARC or these groups' penetration of the Latin American drug trade have not proven robust." Another Brookings scholar, senior fellow on foreign policy Kevin Casas-Zamora, told PolitiFact, "Hezbollah roaming free in Latin America — that's a gross exaggeration." "Hugo Chavez does have close links to Iran, but I doubt it that they present a danger for U.S. national security," said Casas-Zamora, the former vice president of Costa Rica. "If Venezuela was indeed harboring a serious Hezbollah operation we would surely know it by now. The U.S. has had for years an official policy of toning down the confrontation with Chavez, but a serious terrorist threat is the one thing that the U.S. would not countenance." "My impression is that the Republican candidates are trying to crank up the volume of the confrontation with Chavez by accusing him of promoting terrorism as part of a more 'muscular' foreign policy. And they are also trying to blend the threat of drug trafficking with terrorism to justify continuation of an assistance program in Mexico, the results of which are rather debatable. Mixing up the issues of drug trafficking, Chavez and terrorism makes for good soundbites but it is both dangerous and sloppy from the policy standpoint." Our ruling Romney warned during the Republican presidential debate in Washington that "We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." While there's some evidence of Hezbollah sympathizers and fundraisers working in the tri-border area between Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay and perhaps even recruiters and trainers in Chavez-led Venezuela, there's little evidence for the group "working" in Mexico. Even less publicly supported is the idea of that presence amounting to a "very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." The State Department confirms there are no known terror cells of al-Qaida or Hezbollah groups in our hemisphere. Romney was asked to recite a national security issue he worries "nobody is asking about." In this case, there might be a good reason. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-13863	Says Patrick Murphy has "taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/07/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-calls-out-patrick-murphy-wall-street-/	In the race for Marco Rubio’s Senate seat, Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson warned that Rep. Patrick Murphy’s campaign contributions from Wall Street make him far less progressive than what Democrats need in the upper chamber. Grayson made the comment during an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board June 30 when probed about why he doesn’t see eye-to-eye with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Grayson cited Schumer’s long history of Wall Street support to explain why their ideologies don’t connect. Then he hypothesized why Schumer backed Murphy over him. "Guess who has taken more money than any Democrat from Wall Street?" Grayson said, adding that the person was a "certain second-term congressman from Florida who serves in the financial services committee and has no standing in the committee other than the simple right to vote." He continued: "His name is Patrick Murphy, and he's taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader." Murphy, of Jupiter, has only been in Congress since 2013, after he switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. We wondered if it was really possible that Murphy received so much money from Wall Street, and why. For this fact-check we’re only looking at direct contributions made to Murphy’s campaign committee, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions on his behalf. 2016 contributions check out When looking at just the House, Grayson’s point checks out. But technically, Grayson’s statement to the editorial board said Murphy received more money than anyone else in Congress — which comprises two chambers. When you add senators into the mix, Murphy’s contributions from Wall Street-types rank No. 19 overall. (Not bad for 535 members, but still not No. 3) That said, it’s pretty clear from context that Grayson was limiting his statement to members of the House, and for some, the House is "Congress" and the Senate is the Senate. "​While Congress can — and probably should — mean both chambers, many people use ‘Congress’ to refer to the House, and Senate to refer to the Senate," said Christopher Mann, an associate professor in the political science department at Skidmore College. Senators typically receive more Wall Street money because there are fewer of them, so they have more impact on legislation. In addition, senators have more expensive races and therefore ask for more money. Let’s go back to the House. Grayson was referencing a study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that analyzes campaign donations, that showed Murphy received $1.41 million from the "finance, insurance and real estate" sector in the 2016 election cycle. That amount placed Murphy third among all members of the House, with Speaker Paul Ryan at No. 1 with nearly $2 million, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., at No. 2 with $1.58 million. For similar fact-checks, the Center for Responsive Politics has said the best method to find how much money is being donated by Wall Street workers is to look at a subset of this category, called the "securities and investment" sector. This subcategory captures the greatest number of companies associated with Wall Street, without the other fields under the "finance, insurance and real estate" umbrella. Even if you look at it this way, Murphy still places third for those kind of contributions among members of the House. Murphy received $352,500 from the securities and investment sector, according to a 2016 analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. Ahead of Murphy is Ryan with $831,272 and McCarthy with $497,850. Murphy’s money from Wall Street-related industries amounts to about 4.5 percent of the $7.71 million he’s received so far. Why all the love? So why does Wall Street support Murphy so much? A couple of reasons. As Grayson said, Murphy is a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Even though he is not a ranking member, he is on two subcommittees that deal with laws related to capital markets and another on monetary policy and trade. These industries want to be on Murphy’s "good side," Mann said. The bigger reason probably has more to do with Murphy’s goal and its location: The U.S. Senate, representing Florida. Florida is an "expensive state" for political races, Mann said, and Murphy is going to the industries he knows. Murphy has raised more money from three other sectors than Wall Street in his 2015-16 campaign. Murphy raised $721,969 from employees of law firms and lawyers, $595,238 from retirees, and $474,600 from the real estate industry. Also keep in mind that Grayson’s talking point only works for the 2015-16 election cycle. He didn’t specify a point in time for the donations. In his first bid for office in 2012, Murphy received $100,600 from the securities and investment sector. In his 2014 race, Murphy received $255,880 from the securities and investment sector, making him No. 22 among all House members. For the curious, the majority of Grayson’s $2.5 million in contributions comes from retirees, law firms and lawyers, miscellaneous issues, which includes a variety of groups that focus on a single-issue, non-profit institutions and real estate. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy has "taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader." Grayson is right that in the 2015-16 cycle, Murphy raised more money from employees of Wall Street-related fields than any other House member after the House speaker and majority leader. Murphy did not raise as much in his previous two congressional bids, but in context it is clear that Grayson was talking about their current race for the Senate.

pomt-06542	Says that to drive the length of the newly drawn 15th District "you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/05/chris-redfern/ohio-dems-chair-chris-redfern-says-driving-new-15t/	Democratic Party chief Chris Redfern gets paid to take shots at Republicans. On Sept.15, Redfern had a juicy new target for his barbs -- a new congressional map that Republicans had rolled out the day before. It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities. Prepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohio’s 18 congressional districts into 16 districts — 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage. As he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering — the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles. Now represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a "reverse Pac-man," in Redfern’s words. "To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steve’s district you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls," Redfern told reporters at his news conference. Sure, the district is a sprawling one — but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road. Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redfern’s assertion. He forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County. Google maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours — 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps. PolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers’ new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route — they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers’ district. But they had to. Or you’d have to swim. "It’s so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it," The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. "He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other." Bringman acknowledged that the map was more of "an interpretation" of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it. "To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style," he wrote in an e-mail. "Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval." Additionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times — it’s not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another. For example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you can’t use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though it’s a direct link between the two cities. "He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district," said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers’ Columbus congressional office. "There isn’t any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house." Redfern’s statement does include the phrase "without leaving Stivers’ district" but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear. So after all this ramblin’ through Ohio, where do we end up? Google maps estimates Redfern’s route plotted through the "reverse Pac-man" district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls. The claim has to take a detour, though, because it’s not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redfern’s larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose. Lastly, it needs to be said that Redfern’s route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. That’s a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern’s claim Mostly True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2011-10-05T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['Columbus,_Ohio', 'Niagara_Falls']
pomt-11766	The Senate GOP plan does not raise taxes for Americans earning less than $70,000.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/30/thom-tillis/nc-sen-tillis-says-plan-wont-raise-taxes-americans/	North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis says some in the media are twisting the truth about the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Tillis held a news conference Wednesday morning with fellow Republican Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Dean Heller of Nevada to tout and explain the Senate’s efforts. There, he said the plan will help most Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year – contrary to what a reporter suggested to him. "A reporter came up to me and said ‘Senator, how do you respond to the fact that people making $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 are going to be paying more in taxes?’ I said that’s patently untrue on the whole," Tillis told the crowd of reporters. He added that there may be outliers, and that he’s willing to address them at a later time. "You know, if you look at some sort of detailed circumstance, maybe there’s something that we need to work out once we see the implementation of the tax plan," he said. Tillis continued, saying he responded to the reporter’s follow-up by saying, "You need to understand tax policy, and I know that you don’t because you’ve never done it." A video is posted on Senate Republicans’ Facebook page. How does the Senate plan affect Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year? Does it help them, as Tillis suggests? First, a reminder. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. We’ll focus on the Senate plan, since that’s what Tillis was referring to. $450 tax cut Tillis may have expressed criticism of the media, but when we asked him to explain the changes the Senate plan promises, his office referred us to a fact-check published by The Washington Post on Nov. 2. The Post awarded "Four Pinocchios" – the worst possible rating – to Senate Democrats for claiming that the Senate plan would raise income taxes for those who earn less than $86,000 a year. Tillis’ assistant emailed only a link to the story, and sections of it where Post fact-checkers scolded Democrats. The Post found that the average tax cut for the lowest four quintiles of taxpayers -- that is, the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum, or about 97 million households -- would be $450. However, a report by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee (which was the source of confusion for some critics) found that about 8 million households earning less than $86,100 would receive an average tax increase of $794. The Post found that the Democrats mangled their claim. We wanted to look specifically at whether Tillis's claim is accurate. Tax cuts for most – initially For starters, we should note that the Post’s fact-check relied on a "framework" assembled before the bills were finalized, so it’s not an analysis based on the most up-to-date versions of the bills. The Senate plan, like the House plan, breaks annual income into separate income ranges, so it’s hard to pinpoint how the plan would affect someone earning approximately $70,000. But analyses by various groups suggest that most Americans in the group Tillis described – those earning $30,000 to $70,000 a year – would get tax cuts over the next five to eight years. One of the most recent studies of the plan was conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress that is comprised of expert economists, attorneys, and accountants who assist the majority and minority parties in both houses of Congress on tax legislation. The report, compiled on Nov. 27, shows that the plan would cut taxes for most taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 starting in 2019. That year, the JCT estimated 60 percent of people earning $30,000-$40,000 a year would get a tax cut. About 71 percent of the $40,000-$50,000 bracket would get a tax decrease and 80 percent of people earning $50,000-$75,000 would get a cut. The nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center arrived at similar estimates. In 2019, taxpayers with income between about $50,000 and $87,000 would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income. Another group, the Tax Foundation, found that the Senate plan would reduce income tax rates for most single and joint filers earning less than $100,000 a year. For joint filers who earn between $19,050 and $77,400, the rate would fall from 15 percent to 12 percent. "The bottom 80 percent of taxpayers (those in the bottom four quintiles) would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 percent," the Tax Foundation reported. Changes in 2027 So Tillis has a point that many lower-and moderate-income taxpayers will see tax cuts from the bill – at least at first. What he leaves out is that many of the middle-class tax cuts in the bill are temporary. So by 2027, according to the JCT, most Americans earning between $30,000 and $75,000 would see their taxes change by less than $100 compared to today’s rates. In each of those income ranges, the JCT reports that fewer than 15 percent of households would get a tax cut and more than 20 percent would see their taxes rise. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office yielded a similar prediction: the Senate plan would leave Americans earning $40,000 or less as "net losers" by 2021 and most people earning less than $75,000 a year would be worse off by 2027. The Tax Foundation reported a more specific prediction: that "the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 percent." The top 1 percent, meanwhile, might still see tax cuts of up to 4.5 percent. "Because many of the provisions phase-out over five years, there are large differences in incidences between year 1 and year 6," said Michael Walden, William Neal Reynolds distinguished professor and extension economist at N.C. State University. "I have heard some analysts say the phase-out was only done to meet the budget requirements of passing the Senate bill by a simple majority, and that if passed, Congress would likely change the provisions in the future to eliminate the phase-outs," Walden said. "But that is a lot of ‘ifs.’" Daniel Keylin, an assistant to Tillis, took a different approach. He said it’s safer to assume that Congress will act to keep or reduce the tax rate than it is to assume they’ll let taxes rise. "It’s hard to imagine Congress electing to effectively raise taxes on the nation 10 years from now, especially once the economic benefits of tax reform become clear," Keylin said. Other considerations The Senate plan, unlike the House plan, would scrap the federal tax penalty for Americans who do not sign up for health insurance – a burden that falls disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. The mandate was introduced in the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Some could save money if the mandate is lifted. But, if too many go without insurance, health insurance costs could rise across the board for those who opt to keep buying coverage. In addition, anyone without insurance would be responsible for their own medical costs, which would eat into any tax savings. The New York Times reported that the Senate plan might increase taxes for roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize their deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes, according to the Times. North Carolina ranks 23rd – or about average – among U.S. states in itemizing tax deductions, says Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, Wagoner Assistant Professor of Economics at Duke University. "In N.C., only 29% of filers itemize their deductions," Serrato wrote in an email. "This tells me N.C. taxpayer will be hurt by eliminating the (state and local tax) deduction, but only itemizers, who are usually higher income, and that the cost of the deduction is not especially high for North Carolinians." Our ruling Tillis scolded a reporter for suggesting that Americans earning less than $70,000 would pay more in income taxes under the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Initially, most – though not all – Americans in that income range would pay less in taxes. But after a few years, there would be more clear losers than clear winners in tax payments among members of that income group. Tillis is doing some selective presentation of the data. On balance, we rate his statement Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Thom Tillis	None	None	None	2017-11-30T18:50:50	2017-11-29	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13889	David Jolly "has used money and power to try to … drill off our beaches."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jun/30/charlie-crist/us-rep-david-jolly-worked-drill-our-beaches-crist-/	Only hours after U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced he would drop his Senate bid and instead seek re-election to Congress, his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist sent out a fundraising email attacking the incumbent. "We are now being challenged by a well-funded former Washington lobbyist," former Gov. Crist’s June 17, 2016, email stated. "This is a man who has used money and power to try to take away women’s rights, drill off our beaches and block common sense gun control." Jolly had been vying for the U.S. Senate seat Marco Rubio was vacating after his presidential campaign, but Rubio decided he wanted to run for re-election after all. Now Jolly is competing against Crist in a redrawn district that leans heavily Democratic. There’s plenty of accusations packed into that sentence, but Jolly’s record on oil drilling struck us as particularly Florida-centric. Was Jolly an advocate for offshore drilling, as Crist said? Crist has a point about Jolly’s past work, which we’ve previously researched. But his claim ignores Jolly’s record of pushing back against offshore drilling in Congress. Not off our shore Jolly, a former lobbyist and aide to longtime U.S. House Rep C.W. "Bill" Young, replaced the congressman after Young died in office in 2013. He’s been in office since winning a 2014 special election. Offshore drilling, for the most part, is not allowed off Florida shores. The 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act prohibits drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle. The law expires in 2022. Crist is making it sound as if Jolly clearly favors more drilling off the coast of Florida. Jolly’s actions recent actions haven’t shown that at all. As a congressman, Jolly voiced opposition in July 2014 to expanded exploration off Florida’s Atlantic coast using sound waves, out of concern for the same process being used in the Gulf of Mexico. He signed a bipartisan letter to President Barack Obama opposing so-called seismic testing. (The Atlantic drilling was later called off.) He introduced legislation in June 2015 that was co-sponsored by Democratic Reps. Gwen Graham and Patrick Murphy to extend the ban on drilling in the eastern Gulf another five years, until 2027. The following month, he introduced an amendment heading off a Senate plan that would have potentially expanded drilling off Florida’s Gulf coast. This is not to say that Jolly is against drilling for oil as a practice. In an editorial that coincided with his bipartisan bill, he said Florida didn’t need to risk its beaches simply to increase oil production. "In the eastern region off Florida's coast, there are zero producing leases, and none are needed," he wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed on June 3, 2015. "Gulf drilling activities in the western and central Gulf meet today's energy demands and are capable of meeting tomorrow's." Jolly makes no secret his strategy is based on keeping Florida waters free of oil platforms while relying on drilling elsewhere. "I've been pretty clear I support the current administration plan for continued drilling in the western and central Gulf, while strengthening the ban in the eastern Gulf," Jolly told us in an email statement through his spokesman. So where is Crist getting the idea that Jolly worked to open up more drilling? His campaign’s single piece of evidence was one of our own fact-checks from 2014. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused the then-candidate of working to expand the practice in the Gulf, but Jolly claimed he "never lobbied for offshore oil drilling." We rated Jolly’s statement Mostly False. While at his firm Three Bridges Advisors, Jolly had listed on a March 3, 2011, lobbying disclosure form that he had discussed H.R. 909, an energy independence proposal known as the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future. The bill in part called for expanded offshore drilling and was supported by Jolly’s client, an anti-regulation advocacy group called Free Enterprise Nation. Jolly admitted he had listed the bill on the form because he was at a meeting in which his client discussed it, but he "did not lobby on its behalf." Lobbying experts we spoke to at the time said it was unlikely Jolly would have listed the bill if he hadn’t discussed it, although there was no way to verify that. More importantly, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even being in a meeting in which it was discussed was technically a form of lobbying. We decided that Jolly couldn’t claim to having never lobbied on the subject, because he said he had. But we think a single instance of lobbying on a broad energy plan years ago is very different than implying Jolly did (and still) wants to expand drilling entirely. Our ruling Crist said Jolly "has used money and power to try to … drill off our beaches." His campaign’s argument is that Jolly technically lobbied on a failed 2011 bill that would have potentially expanded offshore drilling. But that was several years ago, and about a claim Jolly made during his House campaign concerning one event in his years as a lobbyist. Crist is ignoring Jolly the congressman’s efforts while in office — however nuanced — to keep drilling away from Florida’s shores. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c29ba169-b094-41c3-b660-bfcb9bb12d57	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2016-06-30T12:18:01	2016-06-17	['None']
pomt-03163	An account of attacks in Benghazi written by former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers shows that the body of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was "dragged through the streets" and abused.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-dee-dee-myers-says-amb-chris-st/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain email about the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. Similar emails have been circulating for months, speculating about how U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed by Islamic extremists in the attack. But this email caught our eye because it was purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers, who once served as White House spokeswoman for President Bill Clinton. The email played up the significance of a well-known Democrat breaking with President Barack Obama over what had happened in Benghazi. The reader wondered if it was actually written by Myers, and so did we. Moments after we contacted Myers’ office, she emailed us back, saying she had nothing to do with the account. "No, I didn't write it, don't have any relatives in the Benghazi Guard, didn't have any of the conversations or meetings described in the letter," she told PolitiFact. "There is no truth to it whatsoever." What the email said The email opens by falsely claiming that the account is directly from Myers and that one of her cousins was guarding the ambassador on the night he died. (Read the full text of the email.) The email then purports to tell a disturbing story about what happened that night. In the email's version of events, the cousin dies as well: "... Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals were cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned. He was dragged thru the streets and left for dead. This is eyewitness testimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to save his life. He had no idea who he was. The other 3 men, including my cousin, met similar fates. "Death due to smoke inhalation is a 100% fabricated LIE. ... The next week I drove my aunt and uncle and 2 others to DC to receive his body. We met with Hillary, whom I remain friends with, Panetta, and Susan Rice. All apologized saying it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited the area. Next Obama entered with the same story and made no apology and offered little sympathy." The email ends with a lament for the Clinton years: "The leadership of our country has reduced to lies and deception.......what has happened to us? How I long for President Clinton." Myers herself told us she was not the author of the email and that its details concerning her or supposed relatives are fabricated. We still wondered whether there was any other evidence to support the email’s claims about how Stevens died. Was he "sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned"? What we know about the night of the attacks After the attacks, the administration empowered an Accountability Review Board headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering. In its unclassified final report, the board said the scene was chaotic on the night of Stevens’ death. Officials lost track of Stevens around 11:30 p.m., until he arrived at the Benghazi Medical Center around 1:15 a.m. But the report makes no mention of any kind abuse to Stevens. Instead, it says he was brought to the emergency room by "six civilians .. but to the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders" who arrived on the scene after the American personnel had left. The death, the report said, was due to "apparent smoke inhalation." Another group that reviewed the attack and its aftermath, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- controlled by Republicans -- made no mention of abuse either. Their report concluded that "local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador’s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital." These accounts also track with contemporary reporting. An Associated Press report included an interview with Ziad Abu Zeid, a Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. Abu Zeid told the AP that Stevens was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital, but that "we tried to revive him for an hour and a half but with no success." Abu Zeid said Stevens had bleeding in his stomach because of the asphyxiation but no other injuries. A CNN reporter was told by Libyans that they found Stevens and brought him to the hospital. That report too made no mention of any kind of abuse, and a doctor said Stevens was covered in soot when he arrived. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window, a detail that tracks with what the Accountability Review Board concluded. Meanwhile, the rare published reports that supposedly back up the chain email have been the subject of strong pushback. A Lebanese news outlet, Tayyar.org, published a report soon after the attack that cited Agence France Press reporting that Stevens was raped before being murdered. However, the AFP subsequently released a statement saying that the Tayyar.org report "falsely quoted our news agency and has no truth whatsover to it. AFP promptly sent a strongly worded complaint to that website and they removed the report and published a denial, saying that AFP did not report such a thing." One key piece of evidence has not yet been made public: autopsy results. The FBI was charged with investigating the attack, but it has not yet produced a final report, which would presumably include an autopsy report. A call to the FBI on Sept. 6, 2013, confirmed that no report has been released yet. We will update this report when that information is publicly released. Our ruling The chain email forwarded an account purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers of how her cousin and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed in the Benghazi attack, including being "sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned." Myers told PolitiFact that she had nothing to do with the email, and that anything it said about her was false. As for the email’s claims about Stevens’ being violently attacked and violated rather than killed by smoke inhalation, two government reports and several contemporary journalistic accounts cast strong doubt. The one Web report that supports this scenario was recanted by the website after the mainstream media source it had cited, Agence France Presse, said it had reported no such thing. The email is a combination of fabrication and unsupported speculation. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-09041	Says Republican lieutenants to House Speaker Joe Straus “aired radio ads supporting Democrat(ic state Rep.) Mark Homer... helping the Democrat to a narrow win.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/05/david-barton/gop-activist-says-three-republican-house-members-d/	All wasn’t back slaps and hugs at the Republican State Convention in Dallas last month. Party delegates switched to a new chairman in Houston lawyer Steve Munisteri. And a critic of House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio distributed a letter the morning of June 12 all but indicting Straus and his closest GOP House allies as dangerously beholden to Democrats. The letter from David Barton of Aledo, the state party’s former vice chairman, lists nearly 20 indicators he says show Straus working against both conservative Republicans and the advancement of a conservative legislative agenda. Talk about a Truth-O-Meter dream. If every politico issued such missives, we’d postpone vacations, double up staff, contemplate a reality show. But we digress—and are reviewing just a handful of Barton’s statements, starting with this: “Straus Republican lieutenants Charlie Geren, Jim Keffer, and Byron Cook aired radio ads supporting Democrat Mark Homer over conservative Republican Kirby Hollingsworth, helping the Democrat to a narrow win.” Background: Barton’s statement refers to three GOP House members endorsing an East Texas Democratic incumbent facing a Republican foe. Homer, of Paris, prevailed with 52 percent of the 2008 vote, according to the Texas secretary of state. To our request for back-up information, Barton passed along a copy of a newspaper ad with pro-Homer quotations from the cited GOP House members plus audio of a radio ad narrated by then-Rep. Brian McCall, a Plano Republican recently appointed chancellor of the Texas State University System. The newspaper ad, headlined “Republican Representatives Endorse Mark Homer,” quotes Geren, R-Fort Worth, saying Homer “works with everybody to bridge divides;” Cook, R-Corsicana, calling Homer a “problem solver;” McCall rating Homer “one of the best” and Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, saying: “The only team Mark is on is yours.” The radio spot features McCall saying: “During campaigns you hear a lot of talk about breaking gridlock. Candidates all talk about it. Some even mean it. Mark Homer has done it. Mark works with everybody, Republicans, Democrats, doesn’t matter. He works for you...” McCall then identifies himself as a Republican House member and says he’s joined by Keffer, Cook, Geren and Merritt “urging you to re-elect” Homer. “Mark bridges divides, he looks for common ground, creates solutions,” McCall says in the ad. “...So this time, send a problem solver back to Austin. The only team he’s on is yours.” That certainly sounds like several House Republicans touting a Democratic colleague. Anything askew in Barton’s recap? When we reached them, Homer, McCall and Keffer each confirmed the Republicans pitched in after Homer asked for help, though each man bridled at parts of Barton’s description. For starters, Homer said, his 1,899-vote win was not the squeaker Barton suggests. “For him to call it narrow is stretching it,” he said. Also, he said, the Republicans didn’t air the radio ad, or pay for it, as Barton’s letter says. Instead, Homer said, his campaign wrote the script, which each Republican approved. Homer said his campaign also bought air time. And was the ad a difference-maker, as Barton suggests? We don’t know how to gauge that. Homer said: “It certainly contributed... If I didn’t have it, could I have won? I feel strongly I could have won. But it was nice to have it.” Homer said he’s lined up similar commitments from Republicans this year. Like who? “I am not ready to say,” Homer said. “I don’t want to say yes (about who’s endorsing me) and if it doesn’t work out for some reason, I don’t want that to become a campaign issue.” Keffer noted that Homer was vice chair of a House committee that Keffer chaired. He said of his endorsement: “We are not so polarized and partisan (in the House) that we can’t look at good members on either side of the aisle . . . I am not afraid to do that. We need the best people we can get down in Austin.” McCall questioned the part of Barton’s statement calling Homer’s GOP helpers lieutenants of Speaker Straus. At the time of the 2008 election, McCall pointed out, Straus wasn’t yet the House speaker; he didn’t launch his unexpected candidacy for the post until later. McCall said he doesn’t know if Straus knew about the pro-Homer ad. Upshot: The radio spot wasn’t aired by the Republicans, as Barton puts it, and only one Republican voice -- McCall’s -- was heard. Also, Straus wasn’t House speaker when the ad aired in 2008, so he had no “lieutenants.” But the GOP members Barton named have proven to be Straus allies. And they earlier joined hands in a radio ad for Homer, their Democratic colleague. Barton’s statement is Mostly True.

pomt-02599	"The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-state-budget-surpl/	Why the big surplus predicted in the state budget? Gov. Scott Walker says wise government belt-tightening and reforms, tax cuts and business-friendly deregulation boosted hiring and the economy, promising now to help fill state coffers with extra income-tax revenue. When Walker made that claim in his State of the State address on Jan. 22, 2014, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin begged to differ. "Scott Walker’s "surplus" isn’t built on prudent financial decisions -- it’s built on disinvestments in our future that harm the economic security of the middle class," a Democratic news release issued during the speech argued. "Walker’s first budget cut nearly one billion dollars from public schools and our technical college system that provides critical job training programs." Then the party added this: "The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin." Before Walker’s speech fades into history, let’s check the claim that Wisconsin is far from alone in enjoying a firmer financial footing. Wisconsin is projected to have a $1 billion surplus at the end of the two-year budget period covering July 2013 to July 2015 -- almost all of it because tax collections are rising faster than expected, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said in January. The predicted surplus -- expected revenues exceeding planned expenditures -- is a notable switch from shortfalls that forced Wisconsin and other states into emergency changes to keep budgets balanced during the Great Recession and its immediate aftermath. We asked Democratic Party spokesperson Melissa Baldauff to back up the claim of "higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state." She cited an Associated Press story from January 2014 that said that "almost all states will see fairly decent surpluses" in their 2014 budgets. That story quoted the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO). We followed up with Scott Pattison, executive director of the budget officer’s group. He confirmed the projection. The 2013 stock market surge will goose income tax collections, Pattison said, and many states budgeted conservatively for 2014, not foreseeing the market’s runup. That, he said, means surpluses are in store for fiscal year 2014, which for most states ends by mid-year. And that comes on the heels of the 2013 budget year in which "37 states exceeded original (revenue) forecasts, six states were on target and seven states ended fiscal 2013 below the original revenue estimate," according to the nonpartisan budget association’s December 2013 report, "The Fiscal Survey of States." Baldauff also cited that report. The revenue windfalls meant surpluses were common, the report said. So the Democrats’ claim of "higher than expected tax revenues" and resulting widespread surpluses was confirmed by the group. We broadened our view, checking with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which also regularly tracks state budgets. "State fiscal conditions continued to improve in fiscal year (FY) 2013," the group said in its "State Budget Actions FY 2013 and FY 2014." General fund revenue growth was notably strong and outpaced projections in most states." Did that leave states with extra money to play with? Yes, the group said. "At the same time, expenditures were generally on target," its report said. "The combination of these factors enabled many states to shore up reserves and support supplemental expenditures. Overall, the fiscal situation was solid in almost every state in FY 2013." In another report, the group noted in January 2014 that "in a dramatic turn from recent years, California lawmakers will consider how to allocate a potential budget surplus—yes, a surplus." In its "State Legislatures Magazine" in January 2014, the group added: "Driven by improving revenues and on-target expenditures, states entered fiscal year 2014 in better economic shape than they have been in years." The revenue collection boost was "somewhat unexpected," it said, and many states used the excess to supplement appropriations or fortify their rainy day funds. Early in fiscal 2014 pointed, state revenue collections were meeting or exceeding targets in most states, the group reported. Few are predicting, though, that revenue gains will be as strong as in 2013. Many states planned for that, said Pattison of the budget officers organization, fearing that the 2013 rise was a one-time event. Our rating The Democratic Party of Wisconsin generated this claim: "The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin." State budget watchers confirm a widespread recovery in tax revenues as the nation continues to edge out of the Great Recession. This fiscal year likely will not match 2013 in tax-revenue growth, but states predicted that and most should see surpluses by mid 2014, as most did in 2013. We rate the party’s claim True.

pomt-05530	Says that Mitt Romney, while he was in Arizona, said he believes the state’s SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws.	false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/11/charlie-gonzalez/us-rep-charlie-gonzalez-says-arizona-mitt-romney-s/	Ahead of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s fundraising visit to Texas last month, U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a San Antonio Democrat, criticized the former Massachusetts governor’s immigration positions. In a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee, Gonzalez said that while in Arizona, Romney said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing. We wondered whether Gonzalez accurately characterized Romney’s declaration. Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: "Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature." To back up Gonzalez’s statement, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute. That said, we see how his reply could be misread. As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: "You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?" "You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona," Romney answered. "They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent." E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system. Since the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups have interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states. However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act. "It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court," Nowicki wrote. "That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants." According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email. Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim. The remainder of Romney’s answer: "So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it." So, after praising Arizona’s E-Verify requirement, Romney said that "the right course for America" is to drop the lawsuit against Arizona — presumably the Obama administration’s challenge to SB 1070, now before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a telephone interview, Ramirez argued that Romney was indicating that if state laws like Arizona’s SB 1070 became widespread, then he "would be just fine with that." Williams later told us as much in his email: "Gov. Romney supports the right of states to craft laws that assist the federal government in enforcing immigration laws, particularly when the federal government has failed in its duty to enforce those laws. As president, Gov. Romney will use federal resources to stop illegal immigration, not to sue states that are seeking to help the federal government enforce the law." Of course, saying he wouldn’t sue states that adopt SB 1070-style laws isn’t the same as saying that Arizona’s law should be the model for federal immigration laws. On the other hand, Nowicki noted that even if Romney wasn’t referring to SB 1070 in his "model" comment during the Arizona debate, he hadn’t exactly distanced himself from the law, which was designed to spur a crackdown on illegal immigration by Arizona’s state and local law enforcement agencies. (Before the law could go into effect, the Obama administration sued, asking a federal judge to block the measure. The judge put on hold several provisions, leaving in place others. That decision, upheld by an appeals court, is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on April 25, 2012.) In addition to opposing the federal challenge to the law, Romney has touted the endorsement of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped draft SB 1070 — a fact that the Romney campaign noted in its Jan. 11, 2012, press release announcing the endorsement. In the release, Romney said: "Kris has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country. ... With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem." Kobach, who served as an adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign, has told news organizations, including The Associated Press, that he is serving as an unpaid adviser on immigration issues to Romney's 2012 campaign. In an interview with KNXV-TV in Phoenix for a Jan. 31, 2012, report, Kobach said: "I’m providing advice on the best approach to immigration enforcement and immigration law generally, and I have encouraged the Romney campaign to take a stand of attrition through enforcement, which is what Arizona’s SB 1070 is all about." As The New York Times wrote in a Jan. 24, 2012, blog entry, Romney showed his support for the concept of "attrition through enforcement" when he plugged "self-deportation" as a solution to illegal immigration during a Republican presidential debate a day earlier. The Times blog post says the strategy of inducing illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily arose from a recognition by groups that oppose illegal immigration that the federal government was not going to deport the millions of illegal immigrants living in the United States. "Instead, the idea is to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in this country — by denying them work, driver’s licenses and any public benefits and by stepping up enforcement — that they will give up and go home," the post said. So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation. That’s quite a difference. Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president. Finally, we turned to NumbersUSA, an Arlington-Va.-based nonprofit group that opposes illegal immigration and advocates for limits on legal immigration, because it tracks what the presidential candidates say about immigration. The group’s president, Roy Beck, told us that Romney has expressed support for enacting "attrition by enforcement" policies on a national level such as requiring that businesses use E-Verify. Beck said Romney has not said specific provisions of SB 1070 should be taken as a model for federal immigration laws. Our ruling Gonzalez could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement to reporters mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law. We rate the Texan’s claim as False.	None	Charlie Gonzalez	None	None	None	2012-04-11T06:00:00	2012-03-27	['Arizona', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-05795	"You can’t put a gun rack in a [Chevrolet] Volt."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/24/newt-gingrich/gingrichs-gun-rack-quip-about-volt-shot-full-holes/	Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently went gunnin’ for greenies. Gingrich’s target is the Chevy Volt, an electric car that also can run on gas. During a recent Republican presidential campaign swing through Georgia, he revved up crowds by calling it the car that rich, liberal environmentalists think you ought to drive. President Barack Obama would make you ditch your gas guzzler at the side of the road for the Volt, if he had his way, Gingrich warned. "This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car or truck they want to drive," the former Georgia congressman told a crowd in Cobb County on Saturday. "And I keep trying to get across to my liberal friends: You cannot put a gun rack in a Volt." Slow down there, Mr. Speaker. You can’t put a gun rack in a Volt? Is Gingrich taking us for a ride? We realize this is not a pressing policy issue. And Gingrich was obviously trying to inject a little humor in what has been a demolition derby of a campaign. But PolitiFact Georgia decided it was time for a little detour from our typical GOP primary coverage. We set the Truth-O-Meter’s sights on Gingrich’s high-voltage claim. We contacted the Gingrich campaign for a comment, but did not get a reply by the time this article went to press. The Chevy Volt is a $40,000 electric car. The midsize sedan can travel about 35 miles on battery power alone, but if you need to go a few hundred miles farther, the gas tank kicks in. To charge the Volt, you hook the battery to an orange cord stored under the trunk carpet. The other end plugs into an electrical outlet. Chevy designed the Volt with so-called "early adapters" and green technology fans in mind, company spokesman Robert Peterson said. Owners tend to have high incomes and are concerned about the environment and U.S. energy dependence. Chevy manufactures cargo nets, floor mats, a sunshade and an ashtray for the Volt, but nary a gun rack, Peterson said. "It’s not something we normally consider," he said. He lent us a Volt for our fact check. Car experts weren’t sure a gun rack would fit. "You certainly CAN put a gun rack in a Volt, if you're talking about a tactical shotgun with a dash-mounted rack, as in a police cruiser," said Dan Neil, Pulitzer-winning car columnist and author of the "Rumble Seat" column in The Wall Street Journal. "A window rack, like in pickups? No, that would be difficult." Gingrich took his gun rack quip on the road. He repeated it in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday before a crowd of 3,000 at Oral Roberts University. We heard Gingrich say it again as we sat behind the wheel of a borrowed Chevy Volt, listening to the Sean Hannity radio show. We were hunting for a gun rack, and the Volt did its best to help. It started with the push of a button, and greeted us with a melody that sounded like a harp on Auto-Tune. A screen showed us the location of nearby stores. The Volt’s pearly center console glowed under buttons lit up in cobalt blue. We felt as if R2-D2’s younger, sexier brother was our co-pilot. Local gun store salesmen told us we could get a truck accessory store to customize a rack. We found a video online that showed a Volt owner rigging one up with plastic piping and plywood. We don’t think these were what the former House speaker had in mind. PolitiFact Georgia opted to test products we could buy off the shelf. We returned to the newsroom parking lot with three gun racks and a stick as a gun stand-in. The stick was a precaution. We didn’t want our co-workers to get the wrong idea. It was about 40 inches long, or roughly the length of a shorter shotgun. The first contraption suspended guns on two racks behind the Volt’s seats. They hooked onto the car’s rear headrests and handily balanced the stick. It was designed to fit two long guns. The second used two camouflage neoprene slings to cradle up to two guns behind the car’s front seats. They fit, but not well. The slides of the Volt’s heated seats were in the way. We tied the slings’ bottom attachments to the front seat belt anchors instead. That’s four long guns. The third rack was designed to show off guns in the car’s rear window. The kit came with two plastic hooks with long adjustable bases. Each end was shaped like a wedge. They fit snugly in the space between the upholstery and window, but were about 8 inches too short.

pomt-12040	"Since I’ve been the state treasurer, we’ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent."	half-true	/california/statements/2017/sep/13/john-chiang/chiangs-claim-californias-affordable-housing-doesn/	State Treasurer John Chiang has made boosting California’s supply of affordable housing a key talking point during his run for governor. Chiang, one of several Democratic candidates in the 2018 race, claimed at a recent campaign event in Santa Monica that he’s helped greatly expand that supply. "Since I’ve been the state treasurer, we’ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent," Chiang said in a Facebook live video on August 13, 2017, joined by Congressman Ted Lieu. Chiang made a similar assertion in a Facebook post one month later. California’s struggle to build enough affordable housing is well documented: Estimates place the state's affordable housing shortage at 1.5 million residences. We wanted to know, however, whether Chiang was right about the pace of this construction upswing and whether he left anything out. We set out on a fact check. Our research Chiang took office as treasurer in January 2015. We asked his office for information supporting his statement about the 80 percent growth in construction since that time. It provided data showing the number of low-income housing units constructed -- or rehabilitated -- by developers receiving one of two types of federal tax credits. That combined number jumped from nearly 14,000 units in 2014 to about 25,500 in 2016 -- an increase of about 83 percent, which tracks with Chiang’s statement. These tax credits are awarded by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, headed by Chiang, and are a catalyst for building affordable housing. Matt Schwartz, president of the nonprofit California Housing Partnership, told us these credits are the driving force for as much as 95 percent of the state’s affordable housing construction each year. One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said. Schwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties. The treasurer’s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction. But given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data. How many rehabs? We found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016. "Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That’s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that’s obvious," said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley. A treasurer’s office fact sheet promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are "built or rehabilitated." SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office Not just a coat of paint Representatives for the treasurer told us they’ve always interpreted the term "building, construction" as including both new and rehabilitated units. Mark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than "just slapping paint" on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction. Schwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California’s limited affordable housing stock. He added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state. Our ruling California State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he’s helped boost "the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent" since he took office in 2015. Data from the treasurer’s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016. But Chiang’s claim omits the fact that less than half were new units added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes. Experts told us such improvements help preserve affordable housing, but don’t necessarily expand it. A fact sheet on the treasurer’s website gets the details right. But Chiang's statement in a campaign video and later in a Facebook post leave out this important context. For this reason, we rate Chiang’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-03390	"It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/	A Georgia congressman’s recent attempt to clarify the federal government’s powers in terms of electronic surveillance made us curious. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, said Edward Snowden is flat-out wrong that contractors like him can eavesdrop on the phone calls of Americans whenever they want. Snowden is the former government contractor who caused an international stir by leaking National Security Agency documents about its surveillance program. "That is a lie," Westmoreland said. The congressman, who is a member of the House Committee on Intelligence, explained. "It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so, based on compelling evidence of a connection to terrorism. Plain and simple," Westmoreland wrote in an op-ed that we spotted on the Peach Pundit website. We wondered if the congressman was accurate when he wrote that the NSA cannot legally record or monitor Americans’ telephone calls without a specific FISA warrant. In early June, news accounts in The Guardian and The Washington Post reported that the federal government, as part as what’s called the "2015 program," had hundreds of millions of telephone records as part of its terrorism surveillance efforts. The news organizations also reported on another program used by the NSA and FBI that scours the nation's main Internet companies, extracting audio, video, photographs, emails, documents and connection logs to help analysts track a person's movements and contacts. The reports were based on leaks from Snowden, who wanted to expose the depths of the surveillance. FISA, which stands for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was created in 1978 to establish federal regulations for counter intelligence. A secret court of Washington, D.C.-area federal district court judges was created to hear government requests for search warrants. Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed, a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December. The amendments allow surveillance of non-U.S. citizens overseas who the government believes may be involved in terrorist activities. Section 702 of the act, first approved in 2008, allows such intelligence without a court order for each individual target. A February 2012 letter by Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seeking the act’s reauthorization also supports Westmoreland’s argument. "(T)he Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize annually, with the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), intelligence collection targeting categories of non-U.S. persons abroad, without the need for a court order for each individual target," the officials wrote. The government is required to submit updates about the program’s progress twice a year to Congress. Section 703 sets rules for the surveillance of U.S. citizens. The guidelines require a 90-day court order and additional 90-day renewals, if necessary. Section 704 of the act focuses on U.S. citizens outside the country. It, too, requires a court order to conduct surveillance. Emory University law school professor Charles Shanor said Westmoreland has a point. Shanor said a FISA or a probable cause warrant is necessary for surveillance. "You have to have authorization, even to get the log of calls made," said Shanor, who clerked for a federal court judge and worked for three years as the general counsel at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman Leslie Shedd sent us several documents to back up her boss’s claim. It included testimony from a June 18 House committee hearing that he attended. Several House members asked intelligence officials if they can listen to phone calls without a warrant. Here is one exchange between Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and U.S. Army Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the NSA’s director. ROGERS: "Is -- is the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails under these two programs?" ALEXANDER: "No, we do not have that authority." ROGERS: "Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails?" ALEXANDER: "No." The president addressed the issue during an interview with Charlie Rose on his PBS show. "(I)f you’re a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and it’s not targeting your emails unless it’s getting an individualized court order. That’s the existing rule," Obama said. Is it possible that the federal government has conducted surveillance on U.S. citizens overseas? Intelligence officials told Congress at the June 18 hearing that they do not include U.S. citizens. In order to do surveillance under Section 704, Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Cole said at the June hearing, it would require "identifying that person; identifying the probable cause to believe that that person is involved in either terrorism or foreign intelligence activities; and indicating that we have then the request to the court to allow us to intercept their communications because we've made the showing that they're involved in terrorist or foreign intelligence activities." Again, Westmoreland said it is illegal for intelligence officers to listen to the phone calls of Americans without a FISA warrant. Federal documents, congressional testimony and comments from the president support his claim. The rules are different if you’re not a U.S. citizen. Since Westmoreland specifically referenced U.S. citizens, we rate his claim True.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2013-07-08T00:00:00	2013-06-20	['United_States']
pomt-06866	"Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/02/alliance-retired-americans/washington-group-says-social-security-isnt-contrib/	CORRECTION, Sept. 29, 2011: This fact check originally said that without changes in law, the Social Security trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2036. That is incorrect, a reader pointed out, though 2036 is the year Social Security is expected to no longer cover full benefits--again, barring changes in law. This correction, reflected in the amended text below, does not affect our original rating. The Texas AFL-CIO’s Ed Sills noted in his July 12 email blast of labor-related news that a Washington group was urging people to call their U.S. senators about preserving Social Security. In asking its members to call their senators, the Alliance for Retired Americans said: "Social Security faces an immediate threat from politicians in Washington" who want to cut the program’s cost-of-living inflation adjustment "to reduce the deficit. But Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit." Not a cent? That’s an eye-catching claim because last year for the first time since 1983, Social Security’s income from payroll taxes did not cover what it paid beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2011 annual report says the program ran a "cash deficit" of $49 billion in 2010 and is projected to run a $46 billion deficit in 2011. The summary attributes these shortfalls in part to the weakened economy. It also says that in 2012-14, the agency expects such deficits to shrink as the economy strengthens. In subsequent years, though, Social Security’s deficits are expected to grow rapidly as the "number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers." The agency doesn’t say Social Security is going broke. Through 2022, it says, "annual cash deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets" from the U.S. Treasury. Some "trust fund" background: When Social Security’s payroll tax income exceeds payments to beneficiaries, the government spends the surplus as general revenue and the Treasury gives Social Security interest-bearing bonds in return. When Social Security has to redeem its "trust fund assets" to cover a difference between income and payments, it is relying on these bonds and the interest they generate. As of December 2010, there was about $2.6 trillion in Treasury bonds and related interest in Social Security’s trust fund. Barring changes in law, the agency’s summary report says, the trust fund will not have enough money to cover full benefits starting in 2036. "Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085," the summary states. So the question is, when Social Security’s trust fund is used to cover benefits, is Social Security contributing to the government’s overall deficit, which was approaching $1.4 trillion when we started this review? David Blank, spokesman for the Alliance for Retired Americans, said the group made its not-a-cent claim because Social Security is financed by the payroll tax paid by workers and employers on each worker's first $106,800 of annual income, supplemented by income from the government bonds purchased by the program in surplus-income years. "Social Security is prohibited from spending any money beyond what it has in its trust fund," Blank said by email. "This means that it cannot lawfully contribute to the federal budget deficit, since every penny that it pays out must have come from taxes raised through the program or the interest garnered from the bonds held by the trust fund." Blank’s bottom line: Social Security "is a self-financed program." Correct, said Ben Veghte, a research associate at the National Academy of Social Insurance, whose mission is to "promote understanding of how social insurance contributes to economic security and a vibrant economy." Veghte told us that because Social Security is considered an "off-budget" independently financed program, it simply can’t contribute to the general government deficit. When it needs to draw on revenue from bonds that were purchased in earlier years, he said, it’s simply fetching due returns. At this time, he said, Social Security is funding 83 percent of its benefits from payroll taxes, 13 percent from interest on bonds and 3 percent from taxing the benefits of high-income recipients. Neil Buchanan, a professor of law at George Washington University who’s disputed claims that Social Security is in the ditch, said the program’s 2010 and expected 2011 cash deficits might have been hurried along because of the latest recession, but it’s long been known that as baby boomers started to retire, each year’s payroll tax income for Social Security would stop covering all the costs of benefits. However, Buchanan said, it’s possible to conclude that the recent cash deficits contributed a trivial amounts to the federal deficit. Jagadeesh Gokhale, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said in an interview that whenever Social Security taps proceeds from its U.S. bonds, it’s clearly affecting overall government spending because the Treasury has to get the money somehow, usually by borrowing money from another source. "Basically the liability of the federal government to Social Security is going to be exchanged for liability to the public," Gokhale said. "So, yes, if Social Security is redeeming Treasury IOUs to pay scheduled benefits, it is contributing to the federal government’s unified federal deficit." Unified? The Social Security Administration says the "unified" budget encompasses all of the government’s budgetary activities, excluding Social Security and Post Office operations, with the unified budget deficit being the measure that determines how much the government has to borrow from the public to meet its obligations. Then again, it notes, "those involved in budget matters often produce two sets of numbers, one without Social Security included in the budget totals and one with Social Security included. Thus, Social Security is still frequently treated as though it were part of the unified federal budget even though, technically, it no longer is." Feeling flummoxed, we heard back from June O’Neill, who headed the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for part of the 1990s. O’Neill, an economics professor at Baruch College, City University of New York, aligned with Gokhale of the Cato Institute, saying that whenever Social Security doesn’t collect enough in payroll taxes to cover benefits, its need for additional money naturally ripples through the entire budget. She pointed out, though, that Social Security in 2010 and this year is hardly responsible for a big part of the deficit. Also, she stressed, it would have been incorrect to say Social Security contributed to deficits before last year. That’s because more money came in via payroll taxes than was paid out in benefits. O’Neill said all government programs contribute to the deficit. "There’s nothing special about" Social Security on this point, she said. Put another way, she said, the CBO tracks government receipts and expenditures; Social Security’s money in and money out are included. We’re expertised out. And our conclusion is that there's a legitimate rationale for saying Social Security doesn’t contribute to the deficit. After all, it draws on a payroll tax to pay for itself and has built up $2.6 trillion in Treasury IOUs and interest to cover cash shortfalls. However, when Social Security draws from its trust fund, as it did last year and will again this year, it is asking Treasury for money that has to come from the overall budget. And these transactions contribute to the overall federal deficit--not much perhaps, but more than a penny. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-00916	President Barack Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed "42,000 jobs."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/02/tom-graves/graves-right-number-bit-keystone-jobs-context/	President Barack Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed "42,000 jobs." U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia in a press release on Tuesday, February 24th, 2015 President Barack Obama carried through with his threat to veto a bill approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline almost as soon as it hit his desk last week, and project supporters were equally quick to pounce. Among those criticizing the veto was U.S. Rep Tom Graves of Ranger, who accused Obama of "putting partisan politics in front of all the families who would benefit from the good paying jobs" resulting from the pipeline project. "The president’s veto of 42,000 jobs is appalling," Graves said in a press release issued Tuesday, Feb. 24, the same day as the veto. Keystone XL supporters have long said thousands of new jobs would be created by the controversial project that has been in the works since 2008 and that could allow 800,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sand fields of Alberta, Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. PolitiFact has checked several pipeline-related jobs claims, rating at least three, including one from President Obama, as "False" on the Truth-O-Meter. We decided to check Graves’ statement as well . In January 2014, the State Department issued a report estimating that the pipeline project would support 42,000 jobs, most lasting no more than a year or two, while the pipeline was under construction. It also forecast that no more than 50 permanent jobs would be required to maintain the completed pipeline. In November 2014, we fact-checked a statement by Russ Girling, CEO of TransCanada, the company that wants to build the pipeline. Girling told a Sunday morning television talk show audience that the 42,000 jobs would be "ongoing and enduring," a statement that earned him a False rating. A few months earlier, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner received a False rating for saying that the then-six-year delay in the project’s approval had cost Americans 100,000 jobs. He was citing a study that experts said was "flawed" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was "no longer relevant." The jobs comment that snagged the president came in 2013. Obama told The New York Times that the "most realistic estimates" showed that the pipeline project would create "maybe 2,000 jobs" during construction. That statement was rated False, in part, because the White House did not provide any supporting evidence. In addition, the administration’s own State Department predicted the construction process would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said. For our fact-check of Graves’ statement, we reached out to his spokesman, Garrett Hawkins. We asked if it was fair to suggest that the pipeline bill is an issue of jobs for Americans if the outcome is, based on the State Department’s report, mostly short-term jobs and at best 50 permanent jobs. We also asked if Graves had evidence to suggest otherwise. We received a quick response back from Hawkins, saying; "It is indisputable that President Obama’s own State Department said the Keystone XL pipeline will support more than 42,000 jobs." He said Graves is "pro-jobs, whether it’s one year of employment or a permanent position." "For the Americans who have suffered under President Obama’s economy and are desperate for work, a short-term job would likely be an answer to prayer and a springboard to another opportunity down the road," Hawkins said. "It’s both strange and sad to see the far left belittle these jobs." We should point out that in the past it’s been reported that about 10,000 of those jobs could last only four to eight months. We also should point out that Graves wasn’t the only member of Congress this week to issue a statement on the veto referencing the 42,000 jobs. We saw a statement from U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida's 27th congressional district, saying the pipeline had multiple good points: bringing the U.S. closer to total energy independence; advancing the country’s national security interests; creating around 42,000 jobs and adding more than $2 billion to the national economy. U.S. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik, a Republican from New York, issued a statement saying she was ‘incredibly disappointed’ in the presidential veto of a project that, she said, "would create as many as 42,000 jobs and help lower energy prices for hard-working" families in her district. So where does this leave us? Graves is correct when he says that Americans who are unemployed would jump at the chance at any job -- even one one that would last a year or two at best. Who is to say that job couldn’t be the springboard to another. But when the average person hears that a project has an $8 billion impact and will add 42,000 jobs -- they’re likely thinking that more than 50 of those jobs will be long-term. Yet that’s the State Department estimate -- no more than 50 of these 42,000 jobs will be needed once the pipeline is built. That’s a lot of context that readers are missing in Graves’ statement. Both Democrats and Republicans have spun the numbers on this issue to their advantage. And Graves continues to do that with his statement. Graves statement is accurate and misleading at the same time. He gets very close to a Mostly True on this one, but we thought enough context was missing to take it down a notch. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02611	People on pot "shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/24/nancy-grace/nancy-grace-says-pot-users-shoot-each-other-and-ki/	An amusing Web video pits tough-talking former prosecutor and HLN host Nancy Grace against a combative adversary on the subject of pot: Nancy Grace. In one frame, Grace argues smoking marijuana makes users less prone to picking a fight or "basically starting Mortal Kombat." They’re more likely "to lay on the sofa and eat," she said while discussing Trayvon Martin having marijuana in his system at the time of death. In the other frame, Grace is heated up about the debate du jour: legalized recreational pot in Colorado. In a recent show, Grace dismissed the arguments of a marijuana advocate who thinks the drug should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. She argued about whether the drug is "highly addictive" with Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert, who suggested Grace is against legalization because "she does not like the people that use marijuana." She disagreed. "The reason I’m against legalization of pot is that I’ve seen too many felonies, and I don’t mean pot sales or growing pot," she said. "I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families — wipe out a whole family." Tvert went on to chastise her "1930s" tone, and the argument went on. For many, Grace’s comments about people using marijuana and committing violent acts raised eyebrows, so we decided to check it out. HLN publicists did not respond for comment. The consensus among drug and psychiatry experts: Marijuana alone does not propel one to commit acts of violence. Most users are not lighting up and heading over to Fight Club. They want to wind down, not amp up. And while there is evidence that people who commit crimes often smoke marijuana (in part because smoking marijuana is a crime in many places itself), there is little support to back up the idea that it drives people to commit crimes, especially violent ones like Grace described. "Clearly the majority of users don’t become aggressive," said Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and chief of the Division of Substance & Alcohol Abuse at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "Definitely in terms of clinical work, violence is not the first thing that comes to mind when people are dealing with marijuana." That said, marijuana is still a mind-altering drug, and it could have a different effect on people who are predisposed to aggression and anxiety, he said. It could induce fear or paranoia when people cannot process an environment, though some may withdraw instead of reacting aggressively. Other psychologists and psychiatrists essentially agreed with Salloun. "Other than people driving under the influence, there’s no scientific basis for what she’s saying," said Matthew Johnson, associate professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The effect is often not as dramatic as driving under the influence of alcohol, Johnson said. Usually people who drive while high drive slower, and the impairment is usually noticed when the driver’s attention is divided, he said, akin to the effect of some prescription medications. People who come to treatment facilities are typically using multiple drugs, making it tough to suss out which substance was responsible for a violent act. Violence is not typically associated with the use of marijuana, unless the victim is a "chocolate chip cookie," joked Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the University of Florida’s Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine. Levity aside, Teitelbaum stressed some people can still become addicted to the drug, and he worries about more young people using it with further legalization. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Drug Free America Foundation directed us to a slew of news clips documenting shootings related to marijuana theft, grow houses and co-ops. The clips also highlighted marijuana use of gunmen from some of the country’s most recent and notorious shooting sprees. "In many cases of violence, such as with Benjamin Bishop, Jared Loughner, James Holmes and the Pentagon shooter, these gunmen actively were or previously had been marijuana users," said Calvina Fay, the foundation’s executive director, in a statement. She pointed to a 2012 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and University of Otago in New Zealand that highlighted brain development in teens who smoke marijuana. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on data for more than 1,000 people who were tracked from the time they were born to age 38. People who started using marijuana as teens and used it at least once a week showed the biggest loss in IQ points. People who picked up the drug as adults didn’t show the same loss in mental functioning. Johnson, the Johns Hopkins professor, says this research is controversial because it’s tough to eliminate marijuana use from all other factors that make people willing to engage in behavior that isn’t socially acceptable. "But even if that were true, we’re talking about a small minority," he said. "It’s not a question for the large majority of the public." Gil Kerlikowske, the White House director of national drug-control policy, released an analysis in May that attempted to show a link between crime and marijuana use. It found that 80 percent of adult males arrested for crimes in Sacramento, Calif., in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most commonly detected drug was marijuana, which was found in 54 percent of those arrested. The analysis didn't say what percentage of the crimes were violent and did not conclude that marijuana was the reason people committed crimes. (A positive urine sample only indicates use in the past month.) FBI data for violent crimes with reported drug and alcohol involvement is not broken down by substance, so there is no telling which violent crimes as reported by law enforcement agencies are at least linked to marijuana use. A 2003 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found "surprisingly few" studies have tried to nail down a direct link between marijuana use and crime. After reviewing related academic studies and crunching arrest and crime data, the NBER researchers determined people involved with violent crimes are also likely to use marijuana, but "the marijuana use is not necessarily related to their decision to engage in crime." Their report highlighted a 20-year-old study by the National Research Council that suggested longterm marijuana use may affect a person's nervous system so he or she becomes more violent. Still, the causal link "remains in question," the NBER report said. The researchers did find a positive association between marijuana use and property-damage crimes, particularly among youth. Finally, on the subject of high-profile murderers who use the drug, Johnson said there is bound to be overlap between people accused of murder and those who use marijuana given how popular it is. But the same could be said for people who have blond hair and commit murders, he said. One is not a direct result of the other. Dr. Antoine Douaihy of the University of Pittsburgh College of Medicine said even though he thinks Grace is overreaching, there are concerns about the unknown social risks of legalizing marijuana in more states. Often, he said, people are passionate about the topic without noting nuances or differentiating among legalization, decriminalization and authorizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Our ruling Grace said, people on pot "shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families." Yes, you can find individual cases to back up each of Grace's points, but Grace suggested pot drives people generally to commit violent acts, and there's no evidence of that. Behavioral science experts we consulted stressed using marijuana has consequences. But a hard turn toward violence, including shooting each other and killing families, isn’t one of the direct effects from using the drug for most people. We rate Grace’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05707	"A little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-almost-half-americans-receive-f/	In a speech to supporters at the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, 2012, Rick Santorum offered a set of statistics designed to highlight what he sees as the growing dependence of Americans on the federal government. "In a very short period of time, the next two years, a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them," Santorum said. "After Obamacare, it will not be less than 50 percent; it will be 100 percent." We will take up the two parts of this statement in separate items. In this item, we’ll look at whether it’s correct that "a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them." We’re going to ignore Santorum’s focus on what will happen within "the next two years," since we don’t have a crystal ball. But we think the most recent data can serve as a fair stand-in instead. For that, we can use a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010. The table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance. The Census Bureau found that a little over 147 million Americans received payments from at least one of these programs at a time when the U.S. population was just over 303 million. This meant that 48.5 percent of Americans received federal cash or cash-like benefits -- and it means that Santorum’s number is well-supported. In fact, counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies -- neither of which are included in these figures -- would push that number higher. Our colleague at the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that the usefulness of these numbers is weakened because they count everyone in a household as benefiting from a particular federal payment even if that payment is made in the name of only one person. We think that's a fair point, although we would add that if a couple and their two children live under the same roof as grandma, and she receives Social Security and Medicare, those federal benefits add to the resources available to the rest of the family. And if a child gets free school lunches, his parents will have more disposable income as a result. Our ruling The percentage of Americans "who depend on some form of federal payment" is indeed "a little less than 50 percent," as Santorum said -- it was 48.5 percent in 2010. If anything, the ongoing rise in usage of food stamps and other federal assistance programs may have pushed this number higher, and adding in tax refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies could push the number higher still. The number, however, includes every member of a household in which one member receives benefits, and in some households, it would be a stretch to say, as Santorum does, that as a result of that every member will "depend on some form of federal payment." Discounting for that, we rate Santorum’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-08T11:31:36	2012-03-06	['None']
pomt-00863	"Every day, a black name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white name resume."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/jalen-ross/black-name-resume-50-percent-less-likely-get-respo/	The Sunday shows capped a turbulent week for race relations around the country, from the shooting of two officers in a new wave of protests in Ferguson, Mo., to the closing of a University of Oklahoma fraternity over racist chants. CNN’s State of the Union invited four student leaders to talk about what the next generation can do to improve the dialogue. University of Virginia student council president Jalen Ross pointed out that the most common examples of racial discrimination aren’t limited to dramatic moments that make headlines. "Every day, a black-name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white-name resume," Ross said. "Right? That’s everyday racism." Ross may not be the typical politician who meets our Truth-O-Meter, but we thought his point was interesting and telling about the state of race relations if true. Ross told PolitiFact by email that he was referencing a field study from the National Bureau of Economic Research called "Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?" The study is more than a decade old, published July 2003. Economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan wanted to explore racial bias in the job market. They responded to help-wanted ads for a variety of positions in the fields of sales, administrative support, clerical services and customer services posted in The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune with fake resumes. The researchers plugged in made-up names on the resumes that are associated with African-Americans (they used Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones as examples) or whites (Emily Walsh and Greg Baker) based on naming data for babies born between 1974-79 in Massachusetts. The name on each resume was randomly assigned, so the same resume in some cases had a black name and in others had a white name. Then they counted the callbacks. The resumes with white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names. After responding to 1,300 ads with more than 5,000 resumes, the researchers found that the job applicants with white names needed to send 10 resumes to get one callback, but the black candidate needed to send 15 for one. It didn’t matter whether the employer was a federal contractor or was described as an "equal opportunity employer," as those also discriminated like the others. "We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names," their paper states. "These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market." Ross erred slightly in his exact wording. While white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names, black-sounding names were 33 percent less likely to get responded to. (Thanks percentage change calculators.) The researchers cautioned that their findings do not reveal anything about gaps in hiring rates or earnings between whites and blacks. Also, they only focused on one avenue for job postings, newspaper ads, even though social circles represent a major way people find employment (not to mention that online postings for jobs are much more popular now than 2002). Still, their findings echoed similar preferences among employers for applicants with names that were not distinctively black. After we published our fact-check, Mullainathan told us by email that Ross's characterization of the study is "broadly right," though it's possible the numbers have changed. "I know there have been more recent studies but often in other areas (not employment but housing, etc.), and they continue to find large gaps today," he said. David Figlio, a Northwestern University professor of education and social policy and of economics, said he had no reason to think the dynamics have substantially changed. "There have been a number of recent studies on related topics that suggest that similar patterns are still at work in other areas," Figlio said. "So while I can't confirm the exact number, I believe the fundamental relationship to still be true." We found another National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at a slightly related angle: whether having a name that sounded African-American posed significant harm for one’s economic well-being. The authors analyzed naming patterns of children born in California from the 1960s to 2000. The names DeShawn, Tyrone, Reginald, Shanice, Kiara, Deja and Precious were very popular black names but "virtually unheard of" for white children, they found. Conversely, names such as Connor, Cody, Jake, Molly, Emily, Abigail and Caitlin were way more popular for white children. The differences in name preferences took off with the rise of the Black Power movement in the late 1970s, the authors said. The key difference between the papers is that economists Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt found "little evidence" that names alone can have a direct effect on one’s economic livelihood, concluding that having a black name is "primarily a consequence rather than a cause of poverty and segregation." But the authors said this does not necessarily negate the findings of Bertrand and Mullainathan. They noted that having a black name on its own is not likely to have a big effect throughout the interviewing process, as an employer who meets an applicant and discriminates on race would immediately notice his or her race during the meeting. Also, the fact that Levitt and Fryer did not find a significant impact "could simply mean that their data aren’t comprehensive enough," said Alan Auerbach, a University of California Berkeley economist. Our ruling Ross said, "Every day, a black name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white name resume." A reputable study by respected economists of callback rates for resumes with white- and black-sounding names backs up this point. Ross' biggest error is his specifc phrasing, while white names were 50 percent more likely to get a call back, that means that black names were 33 percent less likely to do so. Ross made a mistake in his phrasing -- one that tripped us up as well. But his overall point remains valid and the study he relied on showed a sizable discrepancy between white and black sounding names. We rate the claim Mostly True. Correction: Like Ross, we originally made a mistake calculating the percent change conveyed by the study. This item has been updated to reflect the correct information.

pomt-10310	On public financing of his campaign.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/barack-obama/he-said-hed-pursue-it-but-opted-out/	"If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." - Barack Obama, fall 2007 "We've made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election." - Barack Obama, June 19, 2008 Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped. "The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people," said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. "Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics." The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad. When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election. To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy. On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the primary election contributions and the general election contributions separate. The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. "Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same," Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the New York Times. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: "If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing." "Yes," Obama said in his response. "In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system. McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system. But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling. Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. "What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody." In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals. As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but the spending could become lopsided to the benefit of one candidate, either because favorable groups buy lots of ads touting him or they buy lots of ads attacking his opponent. In either case, the candidate on the losing side of 527 spending would be at a significant disadvantage if he was using public financing for his campaign and had to adhere to spending limits. So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the public system. "It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections," Obama said in a video to supporters. "But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system." He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by "Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations." Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to a news account that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system. But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the "aggressive pursuit" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest. That might have been a tactical decision, or even a wise one, but we see it as a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-04T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']
pomt-12481	Wisconsin politicians get daily expense payments "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel," and "no receipts are required for them to get paid."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/03/wisconsin-freedom-alliance/do-s-legislator-get-daily-stipend-just-showing/	The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance, a conservative political group, splashed into the news briefly in 2016 when it funded ads criticizing various Republican state Senate candidates during primary campaigns. Now the group is back with a campaign charging that taxpayers are on the hook for bloated pensions, salaries and other benefits for state lawmakers of all political stripes. In an April 2017 radio ad, the alliance ripped a practice that pays Wisconsin state lawmakers a per-diem amount when they travel to the Capitol for business. "Did you know state politicians can collect their per diems even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel? No receipts are required for them to get paid. No receipts! It’s the honor system for politicians paying themselves. Does that sound like a good idea?" Is that the way the system works? The benefit Legislators in most states qualify for per-diems. In many cases they receive more than Wisconsin lawmakers can get. That hasn’t prevented the per-diems from coming under occasional attack in Wisconsin. They top out at $115 a day for state senators, and $78.50 a day (and $157 for an overnight) for Assembly members. In 2016, overall payments to Assembly members ranged from a low of $916 to state Rep. Nancy VanderMeer (R-Tomah) to a high of $9,591 to state Rep. Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), the Assembly minority leader. In total, the 99 Assembly members received $484,504. The 33 senators received $200,860 in 2016. The payments ranged from $2,024.00 to state Sen. Terry Moulton (R-Chippewa Falls) to $14,256 to state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), the majority leader. Lawmakers living close to Madison qualify for lower per-diem rates. Lawmakers base salary is $50,950. The Wisconsin law governing the benefit says legislators "shall be entitled to an allowance for expenses incurred for food and lodging for each day that he or she is in Madison on legislative business." (italics ours). So, if the allowance is tied to spending on food and lodging, is it possible, as the alliance contended, that it is paid "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel?" Michael Flaherty, executive director of the Freedom Alliance, cited a Dec. 30, 2016 story by the USA Today Network-Wisconsin, headlined "Madison lawmakers max out hometown perk". The story said "Lawmakers can collect the money as income without spending a dime on meals, lodging or gas. No receipts of expenses are required to get paid." The no-receipts claim is on target, according to the clerks for the Senate and Assembly. Lawmakers are not asked to itemize. As for whether a lawmaker who skips meals and drives home to sleep can still get a per diem, the answer is, yes, that’s possible. But it’s impossible to say how often that happens, given the loose accounting system. "It’s a benefit, an allowance," said Senate Chief Clerk Jeff Renk. In Renk’s opinion, despite the statute’s talk of expenses incurred, lawmakers who incur no expense while collecting a per diem are not violating the law. The perk is so automatic that lawmakers, at the beginning of a two-year legislative session, choose whether to receive the maximum daily reimbursement for days they travel to Madison within that period. That’s how the law was written. All they have to do to collect is confirm their appearances by entering a mark in a computer program. One piece of the group’s claim requires a minor clarification. Travel costs in the form of mileage are reimbursed separately from the per-diem payments. Our rating The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance claimed that state lawmakers get daily expense payments "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel," and "no receipts are required for them to get paid." Per diems are built on an honor system that requires no documentation that any travel or lodging expense has been incurred. Travel costs, though, have nothing to do with per diems, and some clarification is necessary here because no one can say how often lawmakers get the per diem without spending anything. We rate the claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Wisconsin Freedom Alliance	None	None	None	2017-05-03T05:00:00	2017-04-25	['None']
pomt-02569	"I never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/30/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-never-gave-parental-role-though-she-ag/	Wendy Davis told an Austin crowd that she’s had enough of people distorting her life story, especially in connection with her daughters. According to the text of her speech, which she gave Jan. 28, 2014, to the Travis County Democrats, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate said she was separated from her first husband at 19 and divorced at 21. Her second husband, she said, "was generous and supportive when it came to my education," which extended to earning a degree from Harvard Law School while her two girls (one by her previous marriage) mostly lived in Texas with him. "And when our marriage ended 10 years after my graduation, he and I remained partners, sharing the responsibilities of parenting and doing what was right for Amber and for Dru," she said. "I am very proud of our family, and of the decisions we made together to do what was right for our daughters." "And for those who have mangled the story of my life – either carelessly or purposely – know this: I never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children. And to say otherwise is an absolute lie." Davis once referred to herself as the "noncustodial parent" of her youngest daughter. Is it also correct that she never gave up custody? By email and telephone, lawyers steeped in family law told us it’s rare for a Texas parent to lose custody of a child in the sense of being barred from any parental role. They cautioned, too, that "custody" is an outdated word that obscures how state laws were revised in the mid-1990s so that splitting couples would divorce without one being presumed to have lost his or her parenting role and responsibility. As things stand, a parent may be designated the "managing conservator," lawyers said, or both parents can be declared joint managing conservators. Davis spoke in wake of a news story Davis made her "never" declaration nearly two weeks after a Dallas Morning News news story, posted online Jan. 18, 2014, examined discrepancies in her biography as she has recounted it. For that story, Davis told the paper that her "language should be tighter. I’m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail." The story noted first that Davis’ personal biography had been employed to draw voter support-- "a divorced teenage mother living in a trailer who earned her way to Harvard and political achievement." "The basic elements of the narrative are true," the story said, "but the full story of Davis’ life is more complicated, as often happens when public figures aim to define themselves. In the shorthand version that has developed, some facts have been blurred." Specifically, the newspaper said, Davis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. Also, it said, she lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her first husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter. The story said that as a single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, the story said, also keeping their two daughters while she was in Boston. Past coverage of custody Custody came up as the story said the couple divorced in 2005 and Jeff Davis "was granted parental custody, and the girls stayed with him. Wendy Davis was directed to pay child support." The story quoted Jeff Davis as saying: "She did the right thing. She said, ‘I think you’re right; you’ll make a good, nurturing father. While I’ve been a good mother, it’s not a good time for me right now.’" The story further said that Wendy Davis declined to discuss the circumstances or terms of the divorce. "When I decided to run for governor, I promised my girls we would not revisit a time that was terribly difficult for them," she told the paper. "I will tell you it was very important to me that Dru stay in her childhood home. It was a very difficult time in our life." Sen. Davis also said: "I very willingly, as part of my divorce settlement, paid child support. That was at my request, not any court telling me I needed to financially support my daughters." The Texas Tribune said in a Sept. 1, 2013, news story that when Jeff Davis filed for divorce, Wendy Davis moved to an apartment. The story continued: "The (family) house, which was in her husband's name, is where Amber and Dru grew up, and that is where they wanted to stay, their mother recalled. "The divorce decree in 2005 gave Mr. Davis primary custody of Dru, who was then 17, and" Wendy "Davis agreed to pay $1,200 a month in child support, records show," the Tribune said. ‘Joint managing conservators’ At our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña sent a copy of the agreed divorce decree, dated Nov. 15, 2005. In the 35-page filing, a Fort Worth state district judge ordered that Wendy and Jeff Davis be appointed "parent joint managing conservators" of Dru Davis, who was then 17. Amber Davis was no longer a minor. Acuña also emailed us a statement by the senator’s lawyer in the divorce, Terry Gardner, stating that Davis "always maintained joint custody of her teenage daughter during and after her divorce from Mr. Davis. Both parties were appointed parent joint managing conservators by the court, and shared the responsibilities of parenting their child." The order states that Jeff Davis has the "exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the child within Tarrant County." Both parents, the decree says, retained the right to consent to decisions involving the child’s education, health care and other needs. The decree includes a "standard possession order" specifying when each parent would have Dru Davis living with them--specifying certain weekends and holidays--followed by the stipulation that Wendy Davis pay $1,200 a month in child support. Davis called herself ‘noncustodial parent’ The 2013 Tribune story quoted the senator as saying she did the right thing: ''My girls wanted to stay in their family home. I did feel like as the noncustodial parent that that was my obligation.'' We ran Davis’ "noncustodial parent" comment past Acuña of Davis’ campaign. She did not reply. Earlier, we asked about letters to the Tarrant County district clerk, Thomas Wilder--one dated Dec. 2, 2005, and the other dated Feb. 24, 2006--listing Jeff Davis as the "custodial parent" and Wendy Davis as the "noncustodial parent." We obtained the letters from Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, who found them in records of the divorce kept by the Tarrant County district clerk's office. Acuña, indicating the letters and attached forms were administrative paperwork, said by email that the "divorce decree clearly states that Wendy and Jeff Davis be awarded joint managing conservatorship. The divorce decree is the controlling document." Outside lawyers say senator didn’t give up custody At our request, Jack Sampson, a University of Texas law professor expert in family law, reviewed the decree, saying by phone that it shows Davis did not give up custody in the divorce. "She’s a joint managing conservator," he said, who agreed her daughter would primarily live in the family home with her father. By email, Fort Worth lawyer Chris Nickelson, said that the divorce order shows Davis "was appointed a joint managing conservator and was given possession and access to her daughter. She therefore shared joint custody with Jeff." Similarly, Austin lawyer Jimmy Vaught, chair-elect of the Family Law Section of the State Bar of Texas, said the decree shows the senator and her husband having the same parental rights and duties except for control over where the daughter lives. Asked if making the family home where Jeff Davis lived Dru Davis’ primary home constituted the father gaining greater custody, Nickelson replied: "There will always be a group who perceives having the right to determine the primary residence means you have ‘custody.’ But that is not true under Texas law." He added: "Non-lawyers often think that if one person has more rights or more possession time than the other person, then it means they have custody while the other does not. Despite family lawyers’ best efforts, we have never been able to beat this idea out of people’s heads." Sampson and Nickelson each said the letters to Wilder in the county records reflected only on the senator not being her youngest daughter’s primary caretaker and being ordered, as agreed, to pay child support for about the last half year of Dru Davis’ years as a minor. Both lawyers said the letters do not mean Davis gave up custody. Daughters comment On Jan. 28, 2014, the Davis campaign released letters from the candidate’s daughters. Dru Davis wrote: "My mom has always shared equally in the care and custody of my sister and me." Amber Davis wrote that at the time of her mother’s divorce, "I was a young adult in college and Dru was in high school and to be clear, no one ‘lost or gave up custody’ of either one of us. But no matter how difficult it was, both of our parents were there for us." Our ruling Davis said she "never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children." Custody, it turns out, is an outdated term for what has evolved into "managing conservatorship." And in the senator’s divorce, she and her ex-husband agreed to joint managing conservatorship, which means that neither parent sacrificed custody. That said, her ex-husband’s home was designated as their daughter Dru’s primary residence in the divorce decree and Davis agreed to make child-support payments. Outside of the legal process, it’s not uncommon for the parent who’s not the primary caregiver to be considered noncustodial, which may explain why the candidate described herself this way less than five months ago. Still, it would be incorrect to say she legally relinquished her parental role. We rate this statement, which was missing this clarification, as Mostly True. CLARIFICATIONS, 5:50 p.m., Jan. 30, 2014: This story was amended to clarify that Tilove obtained described letters in the public records of Davis' divorce and that the letters were addressed to the Tarrant County district clerk, not to a lawyer for Wendy Davis.

pomt-08607	"More people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/22/ted-ankrum/ted-ankrum-democrat-us-house-says-annual-us-deaths/	Ted Ankrum, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House seat held by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, floats a startling comparison in an e-mail blast advocating laws ensuring food inspections: "More people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began," his Aug. 31 statement says. "... It takes laws to require testing and inspections AND government inspectors to enforce them. Yet, we do not have the laws since Congress won’t pass them." Wait a sec: Tainted food kills more o' us than war? To our inquiry, Ankrum told us by e-mail that he made the comparison by recalling an article in The New York Times. Via an online search, we found the relevant July 24, 2010, op-ed column, titled "Unsafe at Any Meal." The piece, by Eric Schlosser, author of "Fast Food Nation," says about 200,000 Americans are sickened every day by contaminated food and every year about 325,000 people are hospitalized (due to) a food-borne illness. It goes on: "And the number who are killed annually by something they ate is roughly the same as the number of Americans who’ve been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003." While that punch line is less sweeping than Ankrum's statement, the article doesn't substantiate the comparison. Seeking evidence, we visited websites that respectively track casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. deaths due to foodborne diseases. According to the Iraq Coalition Casualties Count, the United States suffered 4,421 deaths in Iraq from 2003 to Sept. 21, 2010 and 1,301 deaths in Afghanistan since 2001, for a total of 5,722. Keeping in mind when Ankrum made his statement, we also checked U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan as of the end of August 2010; that total was 5,670, according to numbers posted by the U.S. Department of Defense covering deaths in Afghanistan as of Aug. 31 and deaths in Iraq as of Sept. 4. And what of deaths due to food? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 76 million cases of foodborne disease occur each year in the United States, most of them mild. The CDC estimates 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to foodborne illnesses each year. A CDC official, Barbara Mahon, told us via e-mail that although the 5,000 figure was declared in a 1999 article, it remains the best number to cite until the CDC completes an update that's under way. Mahon said: "Making these (death) estimates is a complex process that uses multiple data sources and statistical methods." For instance, she said, threatening Salmonella bacteria can come from many sources including food, water, direct animal contact or even transmission from another person. If a person dies from such an infection, she said, "there is usually no way to know whether they got their infection from contaminated food or from another source. Only if they are part of an outbreak for which a source is determined (usually less than 5 percent of cases of Salmonella infection) would it be possible to know where that particular infection came from. Otherwise, it might or might not have been foodborne." Mahon noted that people "could die of Salmonella without it ever being diagnosed. So, to estimate the true number of Salmonella deaths due to food, it is necessary to take all of this into account, which requires looking at many different kinds of data from multiple sources and using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for the various sources of infection and for under-diagnosis and under-reporting." Back to Ankrum's statement: It looks like annual U.S. food-borne deaths, based on the figure aired in 1999, run short of U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan by about 700. When we followed up, Ankrum told us he relied on his memory of Schlosser's op-ed column in making his statement. "So 'uncle,' you got me," he said. Side note: Schlosser's comparison might have fared better on the Truth-O-Meter even though it says U.S. residents killed by what they eat each year is "roughly" the same as U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. Accounting for his 2003 limit and also adjusting for when the column appeared reduces combined U.S. deaths in the conflicts to 5,477-- less than 10 percent off the CDC's number for annual U.S. deaths from food-borne causes. We rate Ankrum's statement False.	None	Ted Ankrum	None	None	None	2010-09-22T17:59:50	2010-08-31	['United_States', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan']
pomt-12541	Says the University of South Florida invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/19/usf-divest/fact-check-how-does-university-south-florida-inves/	University of South Florida students, faculty and alumni are revamping their efforts to have more say in how the university invests its money. A new video called "#HeyJudy" from the USF Divest coalition urges USF administrators to stop investing in a number of industries that they don’t support, such as private prison operators, tobacco companies, oil companies and weapons manufacturers. A cool-talking student narrator (he’s "kind of a big deal") lays out the problem and calls on USF President Judy Genshaft to implement an ethical review process giving students and faculty some influence over where the money goes. The video laces comments from a the narrator with asides from people who control the industry being called out. "Here at the University of South Florida we invest in oil companies," the narrator says. "Like BP, even though we screwed up your coastline," says a man dressed like an oil executive. "Ooo." "Tobacco companies," the narrator says, adding to the list. "USF hypocritically proudly tobacco free, yet, the school shares in tobacco’s plentiful profits," says a man with a cigar in tow. "That is hypocritical," the narrator responds. "We also invest in weapons manufacturers." "Anyone need a hellfire missile? 50 percent off," exclaims a man with a missile on his shoulder. "No thank you," says the narrator. "And private prisons." "Has anyone seen any black people?" asks a man in a suit. "We need to make our quota." Divestment has been suggested many times at USF since 2013, either through student elections, student petitions or Student Government, often led by the student organization, Students for Justice in Palestine. With the video buzzing on campus we wanted to check out if USF invests its money in oil companies, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. What’s going on with USF’s investments? When we reached out to USF Divest about this claim, they said their evidence stems from a 2013 document detailing how the USF Foundation invests its share of USF’s endowment money. USF’s investments are managed by several entities. The university’s total endowment of more than $400 million is managed by the USF Foundation. The USF Foundation is run by an elected board who raises, manages and invests money from private donors to support the university’s activities. The board’s Investment Committee oversees the university’s $400 million total endowment. The foundation is classified under Florida laws as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, meaning some relevant records are shielded from disclosure. This makes it hard to pinpoint the exact companies the foundation invests its money. Here’s what we know. The committee that oversees the university’s endowment does not select individual stocks or companies for the endowment to invest in; rather, it hires investment managers who decide what funds to invest. Adam Freeman, the communications director for USF, said the video asserts that the USF Foundation made a decision to invest in certain companies, which is not the case. "The university does not invest in individual companies," he said. "A diversified portfolio has exposure to a wide array of asset classes with investments that will span most, if not all, major industries. The investment practices followed by the foundation are common within colleges and universities as well as other institutional investors." Steven Perfect, a finance professor at Florida State University, said investors have no control over the contents of individual funds, but said they can always choose to move to other mutual funds that more closely track their preferences. A strict enforcement of the video’s divestiture goals would be a bit of a challenge, but is certainly possible at some cost, Perfect said. There are certain investment plans that offer investors carbon-free portfolios, for instance. USF Divest said there are hundreds of campaigns going on nationwide and there are many examples of successful divestment efforts. For example, Columbia University divested from private prisons in 2014 by selling its stock in G4S, the world's largest private security firm, as well its shares in the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). What about those specific industries? The foundation’s status under Florida laws and its wide-ranging investment techniques make it hard to pinpoint specific companies and industries where money is being invested. The most recent document about the foundation’s investment decisions is from 2013. Back in 2013, Ken Souza, the investment director of the USF Foundation, provided a list of investment managers that decide what mutual funds to invest in. Once they had the list of mutual funds, the group was able to look up the specific companies using the Securities Exchange Commission Edgar website. To look up a mutual fund on SEC Edgar, you need the name of the mutual fund or the Stock Ticker associated with the mutual fund. (A Stock Ticker is the five-letter identification to look up the mutual fund.) This is what the group received: With the stock tickers, they were able to look at what companies those mutual funds invested in, which included British Petroleum (an oil company), Altria (a tobacco company better known by Philip Morris) and CoreCivic (a company that owns and manages private prisons and detention centers), to name a few. We were able to confirm these companies on the SEC Edgar website. We noticed that portfolio holdings were even more diverse than what USF Divest highlighted. For instance, Wilmington Funds (WMRIX) invests in stock in multiple industries including automobiles, airlines, textiles, technology and energy. USF Divest said it requested more up-to-date information from the foundation but never got it. We asked the university and the foundation, too. Freeman said that the foundation does not have a publicly available document that would provide that level of detail like the 2013 document. (And he did not offer one up.) Besides the foundation’s audited financial statements, the most updated investment information that is publicly available is in the foundation’s Investment Prospectus — a two-page overview about the endowment’s investment strategy. As detailed in the Investment Prospectus, the endowment is invested with managers who specialize in specific asset classes. (An asset class is a group of securities that have similar characteristics and behaviors and is subject to the same laws and regulations.) Perfect said the Foundation’s asset allocation plan suggests it’s investments are diversified, but said he can’t be certain without seeing what’s inside each asset class. Our ruling USF Divest said the university invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. Based on a 2013 list of mutual funds that the foundation invested in, the claim holds water. The caveats are that the mutual fund managers directed where the money should be invested, not the foundation directly, and this investment is common and covers most industries represented on the stock market. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06701	Says Barack Obama’s "favorability rating in Israel once clocked in at 4 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/04/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-barack-obamas-favorable-rating/	Texas humorist Kinky Friedman, who challenged Rick Perry for governor five years ago, prefers Perry to Barack Obama for president. Friedman, who is Jewish, offers among his reasons in an Aug. 24, 2011, column in The Daily Beast that Perry is a friend to Israel who has visited the country "on many more occasions than Obama, who’s been there exactly zero times as president. If I were Obama I wouldn’t go either. His favorability rating in Israel once clocked in at 4 percent." It's been documented that Obama has not been to Israel as president. But Is Friedman’s 4 percent statement right? An online search led us to reports of an August 2009 poll in Israel in which only 4 percent of respondents saw the Democratic president’s administration as more pro-Israel than pro-Palestinian. The Jerusalem Post, which commissioned the poll from the Smith Research Center, reported that 51 percent of the polled Israelis said Obama’s administration was more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israel, 35 percent considered it neutral and 10 percent declined to express an opinion. Six times from May 2009 through May 2011, the polling firm asked Israelis about the Obama administration’s lean toward Israel and the Palestinians, with the August 2009 results marking the administration’s lowest pro-Israel rating, according to a summary chart posted by the newspaper this May. The administration’s highest pro-Israel rating came in May 2009; 31 percent of respondents said it was more pro-Israel, 14 percent said it was more pro-Palestinian. In the May 2011 poll, 12 percent said the administration was more pro-Israel, 40 percent rated it more pro-Palestinian. Next, we asked academic experts and journalists versed in the Middle East about Obama’s standing in Israel. Professors Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame and Jennifer Loewenstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agreed that Obama’s policies toward achieving peace in the Middle East are not weaker toward Israel than those of previous presidents, though there have been perceptions otherwise at least since Obama reached out to the Muslim world in a June 2009 speech in Cairo. Both also noted that The Jerusalem Post polls did not inquire directly into Obama’s popularity. Desch, a political scientist, added that Obama might not be as unpopular in Israel as The Post polls suggest. In a November 2009 poll gauging Obama’s popularity among Israelis, commissioned by the U.S.-based New America Foundation, 41 percent of 1,000 respondents had a favorable view of Obama while 37 percent had an unfavorable view, according to a Dec. 10, 2009, news article in Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. Not that participants had glowing hopes. Haaretz reported that 55 percent of those polled said they thought Obama did not support Israel, with 42 percent saying he did, reflecting the "complexity of views" about him as he pressed both Israel and the Palestinians to resume stalled peace talks, the paper said. The article quoted pollster Jim Gerstein saying: "They genuinely admire and like him ... but at the same time they also want to feel that he is in their corner, and they have concerns over this." In the poll, 50 percent of respondents believed Obama was "weak on terrorism," while 43 percent rated him as naïve, the newspaper said. In its own analysis, the foundation said that while Obama’s favorability rating is "not astronomically high for a U.S. president, it is notably stronger than the favorability ratings for Israel's foreign and defense ministers, and a mere seven (percentage) points below that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu." The foundation quoted Gil Tamary of Israel's Channel 10 News saying that much of Obama's relative unpopularity is a direct consequence of the Israeli press' daily attacks on him. "But based on our survey results," the foundation said, "should Obama decide to make a direct pitch to the Israeli public, his starting position would be one of relative strength. Obama has not yet reached out to Israelis in the way he has to the Muslim world, with his historic trips to Egypt and Turkey. A similarly momentous state visit to Israel could build a tremendous amount of goodwill with an already receptive Israeli public." We searched for other polls of Obama’s standing in Israel. Gallup has not asked explicitly about the president, but it has polled Israelis on whether they approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of the United States. In 2009, Obama’s first year as president, 61 percent approved. In 2010, 54 percent approved, 34 percent disapproved and 14 percent did not know or refused to answer, Gallup says. This year, the Pew Research Center surveyed attitudes on issues including confidence in Obama in more than 20 countries, including Israel. "About half (49 percent) of Israelis have at least some confidence in Obama," Pew said in its July summary, "when it comes to world affairs and about the same percentage (51 percent) has little or no confidence in the U.S. president." The narrow divide in confidence in Obama contrasts with a chasm over his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Only 29 percent of respondents in Israel approved of Obama’s handling of the conflict; 64 percent disapproved. Pew said 84 percent of residents of the Palestinian territories disapproved of Obama’s handling of the conflict. "Elsewhere in the Middle East, at least eight-in-ten in Lebanon (85 percent), Jordan (82 percent) and Egypt (82 percent) disapprove of Obama’s handling of this issue," Pew said. Uriel Heilman, managing editor of JTA, which describes itself as a global news service of the Jewish people, told us in an interview that many Israelis view Obama as hostile to the country’s current government in part because the American president was critical of Israeli settlements at a time the government was seen at home as making peace concessions. Another time, he said, there was umbrage at Netanyahu not getting a photo opportunity or press conference with Obama during a White House visit. Heilman added: "Let’s not forget Obama is a Democrat and Netanyahu is the equivalent of a Republican" in Israel. Also, he said, Obama’s race may be a factor: "Some people have biases." By email, Gil Hoffman, The Jerusalem Post’s chief political correspondent, suggested Obama has not owned up to missteps. He pointed to a July 2010 interview in which Obama was asked by Israeli anchorwoman Yonit Levy about people who feel he doesn’t have a special connection to Israel. Obama replied: "Some of it may just be the fact that my middle name is Hussein, and that creates suspicion. Some of it may have to do with the fact that I have actively reached out to the Muslim community, and I think that sometimes, particularly in the Middle East, there’s the feeling of the friend of my enemy must be my enemy. And the truth of the matter is, is that my outreach to the Muslim community is designed precisely to reduce the antagonism and the dangers posed by a hostile Muslim world to Israel and to the West." He noted, though, that every speech he’d given about Israel referred to the United States’ special bond with it, including support for its survival and people. Hoffman opined that Obama’s unpopularity is rooted in the absence of peace talks and the failure of his policies to "advance the peace process the way his Democratic and Republican predecessors did. The Israeli Right, which doesn't want a Palestinian state, wouldn't have liked him anyway. And the Israeli Left, which desperately wants two states for two peoples, is very disappointed. We had negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for 16 years.They ended when Obama was elected and they have not re-started since." So, what of Friedman’s claim? There was a 4-percent result in a poll, but that question covered the Obama administration’s support for Israel--not Obama’s popularity. Meantime, Obama has been viewed favorably by a greater share of Israelis. The statement misrepresents his standing. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09375	"According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates" of the health care bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/29/mark-kirk/kirk-says-health-care-bill-will-lead-irs-hire-more/	Immediately before and after President Barack Obama signed a landmark health care reform bill on March 23, 2010, critics -- mostly Republicans -- charged that the measure would lead to the hiring of more than 16,000 new Internal Revenue Service employees simply to enforce the bill's tax provisions, including the controversial requirement that almost all Americans secure health insurance or else face a tax penalty. One of at least a dozen lawmakers who made that point was Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who is a strong contender this fall to win the Senate seat once occupied by Obama himself. "About the only jobs created by the (health care) legislation would be at the IRS," Kirk said in a floor speech on March 21, 2010, the day the measure passed the House. "According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people -- over 700 just in Illinois -- to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill." As we looked into the origin of this statistic, we found reasons to be cautious about its accuracy. Let's first look at what the Congressional Budget Office said. On Dec. 19, 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which ultimately became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. In its analysis, the CBO wrote that it had "not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs that would be associated with the legislation," including the costs for the IRS and other "federal agencies that would be responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation." But CBO did offer an estimate of the costs to the IRS for "implementing the eligibility determination, documentation, and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits." The IRS, the analysis said, "would probably" need to spend "between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years." However, CBO did not translate that dollar range into a possible number of new hires. Instead, that task was taken up by another group -- the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. On March 18, 2010, the House Ways and Means Republicans released a report titled, "The Wrong Prescription: Democrats’ Health Overhaul Dangerously Expands IRS Authority." That report is the source of the 16,000-plus figure. The Ways and Means Republicans' report acknowledged that it is "impossible to know exactly how many new employees the IRS would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the Democrats’ health care bill." Still, the report uses IRS data and "reasonable assumptions about costs and program responsibilities" to suggest that as many as 16,500 additional "examiners, agents, and other employees" could be needed. Here's the report's explanation of the math, which is based on the high end of CBO's cost estimate of $10 billion over 10 years: "First, assume that the IRS budget would grow by the $10 billion that CBO indicates could be necessary. While there might be some early-year start-up costs to prepare for the added workload, most of the costs would accrue in the last six years of CBO’s ten-year budget window, when the individual mandate and other provisions, which present the bulk of the new enforcement responsibilities, take effect. Thus, for this analysis, assume that $1 billion total will be spent by the IRS in the first four years to prepare for the mandate with the spending increasing to $1.5 billion per year in each of the last six years. "Second, in the last year for which actual IRS data is available, fiscal year 2009, the IRS employed the equivalent of 92,577 people, nearly half of whom worked directly in examinations and collections. In total, the IRS had payroll and benefit expenses of $8.371 billion, implying that costs per worker were $90,427. If the $1.5 billion in annual funds are used for the payroll and benefits of a similar mix of employees, the IRS could add more than 16,500 additional agents, auditors, examiners, and administrative support personnel to enforce large portions of the nation’s health insurance system." But even as it offered the 16,500 figure, the Ways and Means Republicans' report offered caveats as well. "Some might argue that figure over-estimates the number of employees that would be hired, because it includes only payroll and benefit costs and does not include other costs that would be incurred, including office overhead," the report says. "However, note that the IRS total budget in fiscal year 2009 was $11.708 billion, meaning that, when all costs are included, IRS total spending averaged $126,474 per employee. Thus, critics of the 16,500 figure might argue that any new employees should be assumed to cost as much as the average member of the existing workforce and that the $1.5 billion per year would 'only' support hiring slightly more than 11,800 new IRS employees." In fact, in a footnote, the report said that "it is likely the number would lie somewhere in between the two sets of figures. There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees, such as computers and telephone services. But there could also be fixed costs that are not as affected by additional workers (e.g., the agency may already have extra office space so does not need to rent additional square footage for each additional worker)." We contacted a half-dozen experts in federal human-resources issues to see if they could provide an independent critique of the report's math, but those who responded ultimately declined to either confirm or second-guess the Ways and Means Republicans' calculations, citing uncertainty about what kind of staffing would be needed. One key unknown is whether computer automation -- something in which the IRS has made a substantial investment in recent years -- could handle much of the work stemming from the health care bill, rather than employees. For the record, the IRS itself says that it has not sorted out the employment fallout yet. On March 25, 2010, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman appeared at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. At one point, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., asked Shulman, "You said that right now you are moving forward as far as calculations and costs and staffing needs the IRS has -- you haven't made any of those final determinations yet, have you?" To that question, Shulman answered, "That's correct." Ultimately, we have several problems with the way that Kirk has used the 16,500 figure. • The attribution is misleading. Kirk is right that the 16,500 figure has a connection to CBO -- but only an indirect one. CBO offered a cost estimate, but suggested nothing about how many jobs that dollar figure would translate into. Calculating a jobs number was a task that the Ways and Means Republicans took upon themselves. The CBO is Congress' nonpartisan referee for budgetary questions, and as such maintains a high degree of credibility on both sides of the partisan divide. For Kirk to attribute the 16,500 figure to the CBO rather than to an entity of House Republicans -- who voted unanimously against the final health care bill -- in effect launders partisan fingerprints from the estimate. Even if the 16,500 estimate is ultimately proven accurate, it would have been more accurate to label the the estimate as one coming from a partisan, rather than a nonpartisan, entity. • It uses the high end of the CBO estimate. The CBO estimated a cost burden of between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The Ways and Means Republicans' report made its calculations based only on the high end of that range. If it had used the $5 billion figure instead (or offered it side by side with the $10 billion figure) it would have worked out to 8,250 jobs. Yet Kirk failed to use a qualifier like "as many as" or "up to" 16,500 new IRS employees. • The Ways and Means Republicans themselves acknowledge that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Factoring overhead -- rather than just salaries and benefits -- into the equation would reduce the number from 16,500 new employees to 11,800. This isn't just an outside critique; this is something stated explicitly in the Ways and Means Republicans' own report. And if one uses the $5 billion CBO estimate rather than the $10 billion CBO estimate, that number could shrink to 5,900 new jobs -- substantially below the 16,500 figure used widely in the congressional debate. We think it's fair to assume that the IRS will need to hire new employees, perhaps thousands, to handle the caseload from the new health care bill. And for this item, we will assume that the Ways and Means' Republicans' methodology is credible, since we were not able to find any expert who argued otherwise. Finally, Kirk is hardly alone in ignoring the caveats to the 16,500 figure -- Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., to just cite one example, said in a March 25, 2010, floor speech that "16,500 new IRS agents are going to be required to be hired because of the health care reform bill," which to us expresses an unwarranted degree of certainty. But in this item, we're focusing on Kirk's statement, and we believe it rates only a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mark Kirk	None	None	None	2010-03-29T16:22:26	2010-03-21	['United_States']
pomt-03013	"Rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, (Democrats) sat on their hands and did nothing" when they were the majority.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/15/GaGOP/gop-comes-deals-defense-ethics/	In politics, one of the most important rules is never miss an opportunity to take a shot at the other side. Last month, Georgia’s Democratic and Republican parties attacked each other over the issue of ethics. The genesis of this fight was an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that the head of Georgia's ethics commission is accused by current and former commission employees of improperly intervening in an investigation of Gov. Nathan Deal. "Senate Dems Warned of State Ethics Oversight," read the headline of a news release by the Democrats the day the article was published. The news release accused Deal, a Republican, of engaging in "cronyism." The governor strongly denied any involvement in the ethics case. The Georgia Republican Party sent out its own news release that day, as well. "For over a century, Democrats occupied the Governor's Mansion and set the legislative agenda under the Gold Dome. Rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, they sat on their hands and did nothing," the Republican Party said in a statement. Surely, the Democrats passed some sort of ethics reform in the century it was in charge of the Georgia Legislature and in the governor’s office. Or maybe not. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out. PolitiFact Georgia took a look in the AJC’s digital archives, which go back to the mid-1980s. During that decade, leaders were aghast at the lack of oversight to prevent and punish public corruption in Georgia. The state’s bribery laws were widely considered to be too narrowly defined. News accounts of alleged bribery were as common as the mercury topping 90 degrees. "It was a completely open world," University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. In 1990, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that included a cap on campaign contributions at $3,500. Not good enough, many said. In 1992, the Georgia Legislature passed House Bill 1125, legislation aimed at strengthening the state’s ethics laws and campaign finance guidelines for elected officials. The law required for the first time that lobbyists disclose every penny they spend trying to influence legislation. It also imposed new campaign contribution restrictions. The provisions included: No public officials shall accept more than $101 for a speech or similar activities that relate to the duties of their office; The names and dollar amounts of campaign contributions must be reported; Campaign contributions by individuals, political action committees and companies to statewide candidates are limited to $2,500; the limit is $1,000 for a Legislature candidate; Lobbyists must register themselves and pay an annual fee or face a fine up to $2,000. The legislation was crafted after a 50-member panel was created to study and make recommendations to improve Georgia’s ethics guidelines. The leader of that effort was then-Secretary of State Max Cleland, a DeKalb County Democrat who later became a U.S. senator. "It's a phenomenal improvement in ethics laws in Georgia," Melissa Metcalfe, then director of the citizen lobby group Common Cause Georgia, said about the bill at the time. In 2000, the Georgia House of Representatives passed what the AJC reported at the time was its first formal code of conduct for itself. The code set up procedures for educating House members on ethics guidelines and for publishing a handbook containing rules and laws pertaining to ethical conduct. It also required an ethics training course for all newly elected members. The AJC noted some problems with the new code, such as it allowed lawmakers to take gifts of any value from anyone without disclosing them. It also gave them discretion to keep complaints filed against members confidential even after an initial finding of "substantial evidence" of a violation. Still, both the 1992 bill and the 2000 code were passed when Democrats were in control. Was the GOP trying to rewrite history here? Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party, maintained the claim is accurate. "Our claim is that while in power the Democrats did nothing to ‘prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government,’ " Mahoney said via email. "Passing two ethics-related bills in 130 years clearly isn't ‘prioritizing’ ethics reform. And creating a system ripe for corruption ... where lobbyists can spend unlimited amounts of money on lawmakers did not ‘restore trust in state government,’ " he said. "On the flip side, Republicans in just 10 short years have passed two comprehensive ethics reform bills. Clearly, they prioritize ethics reform and have done lots to restore trust in state government." In 2002, Republican Sonny Perdue won the governorship and the GOP held the majority of seats in the Georgia Senate. In 2005, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that created a bipartisan House-Senate committee to look into legislative conflicts of interest, prohibited former lawmakers from returning to the Capitol as lobbyists for a year and extended lobbyist disclosure provisions to regulatory officials. Some complained that the bipartisan committee’s work would not be done in public. In 2010, the Legislature passed legislation that tightened reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators and made it a crime to use state agencies or authority to attack or harass someone. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a bill that caps gifts from registered lobbyists to government officials at $75. Lobbyists can continue to pay for lawmakers’ meals, cocktails and travel as long as the tab for any single expenditure does not exceed that amount. The cap is one of the more forgiving in the nation among states that allow such spending, but it does mark the first time any limits have been placed on the practice in Georgia. Emmet Bondurant, the former chairman of Georgia Common Cause, said the 1992 bill "would had been considered significant ethics reform." However, he said neither Democrats nor Republicans have been truly serious about ethics reform because they have not given the state ethics commission the ability to investigate potential conflicts of interest. "The ethics commission has been largely confined to record-keeping," said Bondurant, whose wife once served on the commission. Bullock agreed that Georgia passed ethics guidelines on the Democrats’ watch, but he noted that states have gradually toughened their ethics laws in recent decades. In South Carolina, for example, lobbyists cannot buy lawmakers anything. Not even a cup of coffee. Mahoney stood by the claim. "When you do the math and think about how long the Democrats were in charge, I think it’s abundantly clear who has prioritized ethics," he said. Again, the Georgia GOP news release said "rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, (Democrats) sat on their hands and did nothing" when they were the majority in state government. A search back as recently as the 1980s clearly shows there were bills passed aimed at improving ethics in Georgia while Democrats were in charge. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11321	Says that in the U.S. Capitol, "Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues" are "the only ones holding a rifle or a sword."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/apr/12/jonathan-saenz/texan-us-capitol-statues-stephen-f-austin-sam-hous/	A fundraising email staked a claim to uniqueness about Texans in the U.S. Capitol that made us wonder. Jonathan Saenz, who heads Texas Values, a group that says it’s dedicated to faith, family and freedom, wrote March 28, 2018, that during a recent walk through the U.S. Capitol, "I gazed up at the carvings and paintings that tell America’s glorious story… smiling that Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that’s exceptional about America and Texas." That kind of historical trivia seems tailor-made for our Texas Truth-O-Meter. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C., learn that the Capitol houses 100 statues, two donated by each state. According to the Architect of the Capitol, which is the steward of the landmark buildings and grounds of Capitol Hill, such statues were confined to the building’s National Statuary Hall until Congress in 1933 reacted to overcrowding--at the time, 65 statues were wedged three-deep into the hall--by authorizing the statues to be spread throughout the building, which extends to the Capitol Visitor Center. We scrolled online through the architect office’s posted photos of the 100 statues. Could it be that only Austin and Houston were carved holding a gun or sword? Austin’s statue has a long gun front and center, it looked to us, while Houston’s statue just barely appeared to have a sword to its left rear side. But our click-through of photos of the Capitol statues showed that Houston wasn’t the only one holding a sword. (A fair number of others, we saw, hold books.) List of statues holding weapons When we sought expert help, a curator from the Capitol architect’s office, Jennifer Blancato, emailed us a list of Capitol statues holding weapons — with a notation that the Austin statue alone holds a firearm, which she listed as a rifle. Blancato listed 12 Capitol statues--including the one of Houston--of men holding swords. Similarly, William C. diGiacomantonio, chief historian of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, which was chartered by Congress in the 1960s to educate the public on the Capitol’s history and heritage, responded by email that the Capitol statue of Austin is the only one brandishing a musket or rifle while, he said, many Capitol statues hold swords. Blancato specified as the sword-holding statues: Houston; Gen. Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida; Gen. James Shield of Illinois; John Stark of New Hampshire; Philip Kearney of New Jersey; John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania; Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island; John Sevier of Tennessee; Ethan Allen of Vermont; Robert E. Lee of Virginia; and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. (Blancato otherwise said the statues of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii and Chief Washakie of Wyoming hold spears.) We shared Blancato’s break-out with Saenz who said in an emailed statement that he based his claim about the Texas statues on what he noticed while at the Capitol, perhaps "because my focus is always primarily on Texas." Our ruling Saenz said the Capitol statues of Austin and Houston are "the only ones holding a rifle or a sword." This proud Texan's claim has an element of truth in that Austin’s rifle-bearing statue alone holds a rifle. However, a dozen statues donated by states, including the one of Houston, hold swords.

pomt-12778	"Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/21/blog-posting/muslims-objecting-kids-singing-national-anthem-was/	A series of Internet posts implying that Muslim parents don’t want their kids to sing the national anthem has continued to cause a stir, mostly by not making it clear to readers that the controversy is actually years old — and in Australia. "Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem," read the headline on a post we first saw Feb. 20, 2017, on LadyLibertysNews.com. Facebook brought it to our attention as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear its news feeds of fake news. The post was one of many others across cyberspace that discussed how an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children must sing the national anthem. Though some choppy grammar and poor editing made it difficult to know what was a direct quote, we gleaned that a Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman named Unthman Badar said the national anthem was part of a concerted effort of "forced assimilation" of Muslims by Australian officials. But the post included two deceptive photos of schoolchildren standing at attention before an American flag in a classroom. Let’s be clear: There is a controversial pro-Islamic group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir, and their spokesman Uthman Badar (note the spelling difference) did say Muslim children should not sing the national anthem. But what’s not entirely clear from the story is that this happened during a contentious meeting about the strain of Islamic citizens assimilating into Australian culture, held in Sydney on Nov. 1, 2015. "This imposition of values is manifest in matters such as the insistence of senior government ministers that Muslim children sing the national anthem – an anthem which reflects a particular, disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values ... Why should they be forced to sing it?" Badar said, according to news reports. (Watch his speech above; the relevant portion starts around the 9:50 mark.) "It is nothing less than forced assimilation ... sought to be justif­ied by exaggerated fear of a security threat," he added. The Australian anthem reads: Australians all let us rejoice, For we are young and free; We've golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts; Of beauty rich and rare; In history's page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair Beneath our radiant Southern Cross, We'll toil with hearts and hands, To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands, For those who've come across the seas We've boundless plains to share, With courage let us all combine To advance Australia fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia fair. The LadyLibertysNews.com story did mention that the story was about Australia, but you had to read carefully to see that. Their post on Facebook was even more deceptive. It includes the caption, "If you're offended by our beautiful flag, representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country, you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!" The LadyLibertysNews.com Facebook page includes a picture of President Donald Trump taking the oath of office and is written from an American perspective. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To the site’s credit, when we contacted them via Facebook message about the post on Feb. 20, they conceded the photo choice was incorrect. Shortly thereafter, they changed the images to a single photo of the Australian flag. As of this writing, they have not amended their Facebook post, which had been shared more than 13,000 times. Our ruling A blog post claiming that Muslims are offended "their kids have to recite national anthem" linked to a deceptively edited post that includes images of children standing at attention before an American flag. In reality, the genesis of the story is not from America but Australia, where a spokesman for an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children should be forced to sing the Australian national anthem. The post, which has been altered after we inquired, is definitely misleading but not altogether fake. It also comes from 2015, which isn’t mentioned in the post being virally shared.

pomt-00964	"Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/16/dave-claunch/mayor-dave-claunch-says-austin-has-more-capitol-lo/	Texas cities naturally gear up to fight state encroachment by enlisting lobbyists, an Austin-area leader said. At a January West Lake Hills City Council meeting, where the council voted to hire a lobbying firm for $40,500 over nine months, Mayor Dave Claunch said employing lobbyists is a way for cities to preserve local control. Claunch went on to say: "Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas, mostly because they are frequently a target of the Legislature." Is Austin No. 1 among Texas cities in its load of lobbyists patrolling the Capitol? Claunch, asked how he reached his conclusion, said by phone that's just "common general knowledge." Checking lobbyist registrations For our own look, we turned to state filings by lobbyists. The Texas Ethics Commission has the responsibility of maintaining records including lobbying activity reports. Under state law, lobbyists are required to register with the commission and list their clients annually; the filings are available online. By phone, Natalia Ashley of the Texas Ethics Commission staff said whenever a lobbyist gets a client, he or she must amend their registration. When this happens, the agency’s public lobbyist-client lists are updated, she said. And when there is an update, she said, the new breakdown replaces the previous version posted online, "so we don’t keep a printed document for each update." Still with us? This was significant for our purposes, we realized, because a lobbyist-client list for 2015 about the moment Claunch spoke wasn’t readily available to us a few days later. By the time we inquired, that particular list had been overtaken online by updated versions possibly presenting information that would not have existed when Claunch spoke. To fairly check his claim, then, we considered a next-best thing, the agency’s lobbyist-client list for cities covering 2014. And according to that 2014 Lobby List, updated by the state Jan. 9, 2015, the City of Austin had 22 state-registered lobbyists in 2014, a total greater than the count shown for any of 89 other municipalities. The City of Irving, between Dallas and Fort Worth, came in second with 13. West Lake Hills had four people registered. Top 5 Texas Cities Based on Number of Registered Outside Lobbyists (2014) CITY STATE-REGISTERED LOBBYISTS Austin 22 Irving 13 Fort Worth 10 Houston 9 San Antonio 9 Source: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (downloaded Feb. 4, 2015) A complication? We wondered if those reported counts made this a slam-dunk claim. Possibly not, a City of Austin official suggested. John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer, told us that even though 22 people were listed as lobbying for the city in 2014, he directly consulted with less than half that many. Similarly, a City of San Antonio official said by phone the number of lobbyists shown in state filings as representing that city do not reflect the lobbyists he regularly consults. Jeff Coyle, San Antonio’s director of intergovernmental relations, said he communicates actively with about four or five of San Antonio’s nine contracted lobbyists. Brie Franco, legislative attorney for the City of El Paso, said by phone that she talks directly to three of the four lobbyists listed as representing the city in state records. El Paso hired the firm Focused Advocacy to represent its interests in the legislative session, the same firm enlisted by West Lake Hills. Hrncir said that when a lobbying firm tells the ethics commission its clients and expected payments, the firm may specify all employees with any possibility of doing work on behalf of the city. We ran Hrncir’s analysis by Jack Gullahorn, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, which says it’s the only recognized statewide association for the lobby and government affairs community. By phone, Gullahorn said Hrncir was correct and added that the entirety of lobbyists in a firm routinely register for all of the clients listed underneath the firm even though someone at the practice may be the primary contact. Lobbyists do this "to be conservative in following the law," Gullahorn said, by ensuring they don’t get in trouble with the state if someone is found lobbying for the city without reporting that in advance. According to an ethics commission report on laws affecting lobbyists, each lobbyist must provide information about each client that employs, retains or reimburses them to lobby. Spending on lobbyists It’s one thing for Austin to have the most lobbyists indicating they’re out there walking the pink building on its behalf. We also looked into how the city stacks up in spending on contract lobbyists at the Capitol. According to a resolution approved without debate at the Austin City Council’s Nov. 20, 2014, meeting, council members agreed to contract with 10 lobbying firms for the 2015 legislative session for an amount not to exceed $805,000 all together. But there were a couple changes after that, Hrncir said, because lobbyists Randy Erben and Luis Saenz joined the administration of Gov. Greg Abbott. Hrncir said the city made an individual contract with Brian Yarbrough, Erben’s previous partner. Jennifer Rodriguez from McGuireWoods Consulting was to assume Saenz’s role on the city’s part, Hrncir said. Lobby Firms Hired by City of Austin Before 2015 Legislative Session FIRM MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM OR LOBBYIST EXPECTS FROM THE CITY FOR LOBBYING Nora Del Bosque $65,000 Randall Erben*/Erben & Yarbrough $90,000 Marta Greytok Consulting $90,000 Cliff Johnson $90,000 Demetrius McDaniel/GreenbergTaurig $90,000 Clayton Pope $90,000 Luis Saenz*/McGuireWoods Consulting $70,000 Trent Townsend/Imperium Public Affairs $65,000 Joe D. Valenzuela $65,000 Angelo Zottarelli/Adams & Zottarelli, LLC $90,000 TOTAL $805,000 *Erben and Saenz were appointed in December 2014 to be legislative director and appointments director, respectively, for Gov. Greg Abbott, with their duties hence shifted by the city to others, according to John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer. Source: City of Austin web page, "Resolution No. 20141120-036," adopted by Austin City Council, Nov. 20, 2014 (accessed Feb. 4, 2015) According to lobbyist filings with the commission covering 2014, Austin also was No. 1 in expected spending on lobbyists at the Texas Capitol. To approximate the amount city-hired lobbyists expected to be paid during 2014, we noted the minimum values and maximum values of prospective compensation reported by all the lobbyists listed for each of the five cities already having the most outside lobbyists for the year. In this subset, Austin was No. 1 again (as noted) but Irving, which had more lobbyists than Houston and Fort Worth, was evidently outspent by bigger cities. Projected Ranges of Compensation for City Lobbyists in Texas (Sampling)* 2014 City Projected Range of Compensation of Lobbyists Registered to Represent City Austin Up to $575,000 - $1,050,000 Fort Worth Up to $225,000 - $445,000 Houston Up to $345,000 - $420,000 Irving Up to $215,000 - $340,000 San Antonio Up to $145,000 - $280,000 *This chart reflects projected compensation amounts to lobbyists hired by only the five cities with the most outside lobbyists per commission filings in 2014. Source: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (Feb. 6, 2015) Our ruling Claunch said: "Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas." In 2014, indeed, Austin had more lobbyists (22) representing its interests before state government than any other Texas city and also was expected to spend more on such lobbyists than a few other cities identified as clients by multiple lobbyists. But lobbyist filings with the state don’t reveal how much time any lobbyist puts in for a particular client. It's possible, for instance, that some lobbyists who registered for Austin worked for firms hired by the city but didn’t personally put in time on its behalf.

pomt-15211	Emails released to the public show Hillary Clinton discussed "the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/11/andrew-napolitano/did-hillary-clinton-emails-reveal-location-ambassa/	Of course Hillary Clinton’s emails contained classified information, says Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano. That’s obvious, in his view, from the sensitive content of the emails that have been released. The FBI is now investigating the security of the private email system Clinton used while secretary of state, which was not designed to handle classified information. Clinton has said she never dealt with classified information on her private server, though two government watchdog groups have said she did. Even the emails that have now been made public contain sensitive information -— including information about Benghazi, said Napolitano, a former judge, in an Aug. 5 conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity. "I saw emails that have been revealed under the Freedom of Information Act," Napolitano said. "And in them, she is discussing the location of French fighter jets during the NATO bombardment of Libya, how big the no-fly zone is, where the no-fly zones are, and are you ready for this? — the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya. If that is not classified — if she didn’t know that was classified, she has no business being in public office." Former U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed in the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Do emails contained on Clinton’s private server really discuss information about his location in Libya? As we'll see, Clinton's emails discuss Stevens' location in general terms — similar to information shared in the media at the time. Key emails We found six possibly relevant emails in the cache of Clinton emails that the State Department has released to the public so far. These emails all take place in a one-month period in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War, about a year and a half before the September 2012 Benghazi attack. At the time, Stevens was not yet the ambassador — he was the special envoy to the Transitional National Council (called the TNC), then the de facto government of Libya — and he was embarking on his first trip to Libya in this role. He became ambassador in May 2012, about four months before his death. We’ll lay out the key points in each email that speak to Stevens’ whereabouts, and then get into the analysis. March 23, 2011: In this email, which Napolitano pointed out to us, Clinton’s then-chief of staff Jacob Sullivan wrote to Clinton about the NATO mission in Libya. Sullivan also wrote that someone named Bill was "trying to make sure Chris Stevens gets into E. Libya." March 27, 2011: This is an email between two State Department officials that was then forwarded to Clinton. The subject line is: "Chris Stevens mission." Regarding his location and travel plans, the email said, "The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days." April 8, 2011: An email among State Department employees (marked "sensitive but unclassified") that was later forwarded to Clinton said, "Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required." April 10, 2011: Another email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton marked "sensitive but unclassified" said, "The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat, etc)." April 22, 2011: Yet another email among State Department employees, this one marked "unclassified," that was later forwarded to Clinton, "I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5." April 24, 2011: A final email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton: "Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off." After this email, few of the emails released so far discuss Stevens in any capacity until after the 2012 attacks. Clinton only participated in the March 23 email conversation, and she did not say anything about Stevens’ location; in the other emails, she only received the messages. In any case, the information ended up on her private email server. What do the emails tell us? These emails do discuss Stevens’ location, though the terms are vague. We learn from the emails that Stevens was in Malta then Benghazi, where he met with local leaders at unspecified locations, and he stayed at an unnamed hotel. That’s about it. Napolitano’s statement suggests that if a bad guy had gotten his hands on these emails, Stevens could have been in danger because the bad guys would know exactly where to find him. In reality, these emails don’t reveal much more than what was publicly known at the time. On March 25, 2011, Stevens’ predecessor, Ambassador Gene Cretz, said in a press conference that Stevens would soon be traveling to Benghazi. We found at least four State Department daily press briefings between March and April 2011, where a press secretary discussed Stevens’ Benghazi plans with journalists. Quite a few newspaper and television reports at the time said Stevens was in Benghazi meeting with local leaders, such as the New York Times and Fox News. The media reports did not mention that Stevens went into Libya by way of Malta, and that he had set up shop at a hotel. There is, however, an April 11, 2011, Associated Press photo of Stevens meeting with local journalists at the Tibesty hotel in Benghazi, where we now know (as a result of State Department and congressional Benghazi investigations) Stevens had lived and worked in 2011. Now to address the broader point of Napolitano’s statement: that Clinton sent and received classified information. Three of the six emails detailed above were marked "unclassified." Regarding the other three, Clinton received information from other State Department employees, and — as we found in a prior story — as head of the agency, she had the authority to say whether information from her department was classified or not. Of course, there’s always the possibility of Clinton emails clearly containing classified or sensitive information about Stevens that have yet to be or never will be released. But Napolitano specified that he was talking about emails already available to the public. Our ruling Napolitano said emails released to the public show Clinton discussed "the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya." To clarify, Stevens was not the ambassador to Libya at the time, and the emails occurred about 18 months before the Benghazi attacks that killed him. Clinton received at least six emails that discussed Stevens’ location in Libya, though the terms are vague -- for example, saying he was in Benghazi at an unidentified hotel. The context of Napolitano’s statement gives the impression that the emails contain information that would have been damaging if released, but it was widely noted in the media at the time that Stevens was in Benghazi, and on at least one occasion, reporters encountered him at the hotel where he was living and working. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-05172	Says he has nearly 200 delegates bound to support his candidacy at the Republican National Convention.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-touts-nearly-200-delegates-bound-his-cand/	U.S. Rep. Ron Paul proclaims "great news" in a message to supporters posted online June 6, 2012. The Texas presidential candidate says: "Due to the smart planning of our campaign and the hard work and diligence of supporters like you, we stand to send nearly 200 bound delegates to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. This number shatters the predictions of the pundits and talking heads and shows the seriousness of our movement." Paul’s message continues: "What’s more, we will send several hundred additional supporters to Tampa who, while bound to" presumptive nominee Mitt "Romney, believe in our ideas of liberty, constitutional government, and a common-sense foreign policy. When it is all said and done, we will likely have as many as 500 supporters as delegates on the convention floor. That is just over 20 percent!" We don’t know how anyone could pin the number of philosophical supporters Paul will have at the convention in late August. Setting that aside, is it correct, as Paul says, that his campaign stands to send nearly 200 "bound delegates" to Tampa? Agreed, one could view Paul’s declaration as a prediction that’s not factually checkable. We see it, though, as a done-did-it boast; note his present-tense crow that the total "shatters the predictions" of others. Let’s look at whether evidence backs up his message. Paul’s campaign did not reply to our requests for elaboration. So, unfortunately, we do not know how he gets to his "nearly 200" count. An independent monitor of delegates won by each candidate, the Associated Press news organization, pegs Paul’s current delegate count at 137. It puts Romney at 1,480 of the party’s 2,286 delegates. Other former candidates and delegate counts, as tabulated by the AP: Rick Santorum (267); Newt Gingrich (138); Jon Huntsman (2). On a web page showing the count, the AP says Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, "became the Republican party's presidential nominee by crossing the threshold of 1,144 delegates to the GOP national convention. ... Most delegates are awarded through state primaries and caucuses. Other delegates, mostly members of the Republican National Committee, are free to endorse any candidate they choose at any time, even before a primary. The Associated Press includes such delegates in its tally once they declare a candidate preference." According to the AP, Paul’s delegates were accumulated in 21 states, starting with one delegate in Iowa’s Jan. 3, 2012, caucuses and three in the subsequent New Hampshire primary. Paul drew the majority of delegates resulting from February caucuses in Minnesota and Maine, drawing 30 and 21 delegates, respectively. He won 18 delegates in the Texas primary in May. Notably, too, some delegates remain to be chosen. For instance, Utah, where Romney has long ties, will determine 40 delegates via its June 26 primary. For deeper perspective, we asked the reporter who oversees the AP count, Stephen Ohlemacher, if Paul stands to have nearly 200 bound delegates at the convention. Ohlemacher said that’s theoretically possible. When we visited by phone on June 13, 2012, Ohlemacher said the AP had either not determined — or voters and activists had yet to decide — how about 230 delegates break out between Romney and Paul, counting 46 members of the Republican National Committee yet to say who they support. RNC members are automatic delegates and may support any candidate they choose. Ohlemacher elaborated in a follow-up email: "Delegates are bound -- or unbound -- based on state party rules. For delegates who are bound by the outcome of primaries, I simply do the calculations on election night and verify them later with the state party. State parties sometimes wait for the certified election results, which can take a month or longer in some states. "For unbound delegates, the AP asks them whom they support. If they say they support a candidate, we count the delegate in that candidate’s total. But we don’t bind them. In fact, when the nomination was still in doubt, we re-interviewed many RNC delegates several times to see if they had changed their minds." In five of six states with caucuses -- Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine and Washington -- the AP reached delegate counts by assuming each candidate would capture the share of delegates commensurate with how they fared on caucus day, even though actual mix of delegates would be determined later, Ohlemacher said. Still to settle out, he said, are Utah’s winner-take-all primary and delegate-selection decisions at state conventions in Iowa, where the party chair supports Paul and 26 delegates are to be awarded; Montana, with 23 delegates at issue; and Nebraska, with 32 delegates at stake. Looking back, Ohlemacher said that in Pennsylvania, 59 delegates were elected directly on the ballot, with no indication whom they supported for president. The AP reached 31 of them, he said, with 28 yet to respond, making their candidate choices unknown. Also, he said, the Pennsylvania party has yet to pick 10 additional delegates. On another front, Louisiana’s recent state convention ended with 23 delegates not assigned to candidates, he said. Five were to be "uncommitted," he said, based on the state’s GOP primary results. Also, he said, the AP has not determined the alignment of 12 delegates picked at the Illinois state convention or 16 delegates chosen at Indiana’s convention. Phew. It could be, we suppose, that Paul picks up enough yet-to-be determined delegates to have nearly 200 delegates at the convention. However, it also seems unlikely Paul could have known as much for a certainty when he sent his message. Separately, we contacted Romney’s campaign about delegate counts and didn’t hear back. We also nudged Ted Kwong, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, who deferred to the AP’s count. "We don’t have an official, up-to-date delegate count," Kwong said by phone. Our ruling If enough yet-to-be-chosen or yet-to-declare delegates go Paul’s way, he could land nearly 200 delegates. However, we rate claims based on what’s known when the claims are made. Paul had 137 delegates when he wrote supporters about shattering predictions. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-06-15T16:49:13	2012-06-06	['None']
pomt-13480	"Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/trump-says-veterans-treated-worse-illegal-immigran/	Donald Trump has repeatedly said immigrants living illegally in the United States have it better than veterans who have served the country. He said it over Memorial Day weekend at a rally honoring prisoners of wars and troops missing in action, during a speech in Arizona outlining his immigration plan and most recently at the Union League of Philadelphia, which supports veterans and their families. "Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants, people that come into our country illegally," Trump said Sept. 7. His campaign stuck by the claim, offering evidence he is right. We decided to take a deeper look. The Trump campaign’s argument In an email, the Trump campaign claimed that many politicians give more attention and pledge more support to those in the country illegally than to veterans. Specifically, Trump’s campaign said Hillary Clinton "downplayed" the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal about veterans waiting for months for medical care. (We rated Mostly False a claim by Trump that Clinton is "satisfied" with the VA.) They also noted that she has not demanded "the introduction of a massive veterans benefits bill her first 100 days as president." Instead, she said pledged "to fight for illegal immigrants and spend taxpayer dollars granting them benefits, such as Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare." (We rated a similar claim by Trump Mostly False that Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and to provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for undocumented immigrants.) Trump’s campaign also pointed to a 2008 Washington Post article noting that a man had previously been convicted of drunken driving but not questioned about his immigration status. He later killed two people while drunk and speeding, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. "Illegal immigrants convicted of DUIs are often released without any immigration consequences," Trump’s press team wrote. "But members of the military who receive DUIs are subject punishment from their commanding officers and court martial." The campaign also said that in terms of financial resources, billions of dollars are spent at all levels of government on undocumented immigrants, about $950 million were budgeted for fiscal year 2016 to care for children who entered the country illegally without their parents, cost to house undocumented immigrants in prisons in fiscal year 2014 was $1.87 billion. Other than the anecdote about the DUI case, we’re not sure any of these examples show how veterans are being treated worse than people living in the United States illegally. So we decided to directly compare the two groups using things Trump often talks about -- education, health care and tax and fiscal policy. Education In terms of K-12 public education, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that no one can be denied access, even if they are undocumented, said Irene Bloemraad, a sociology professor at the University of California. That equal access also applies to veterans, but presumably veterans are not seeking K-12 education, Bloemraad said. "At best, we can conclude no advantage, one way or another, at this level of education," she said. That Supreme Court ruling does not apply to post-secondary education and it’s up to states to set the rules regarding undocumented immigrants’ access to public colleges and universities, Bloemraad said. Two states -- Alabama and South Carolina -- bar undocumented students from enrolling in public postsecondary institutions. Georgia’s State Board of Regents does not allow undocumented students to enroll in selective public universities (institutions that admit fewer than apply), according to University Leaders for Educational Access and Diversity Network. "Veterans would presumably face no ban to enrolling," Bloemraad said. "So clearly, veterans are not treated worse; rather, in some states undocumented students are in a much more difficult position." A veteran resident can also pay in-state tuition rates and can apply for federal benefits for post-secondary education, she said. Higher education and training benefits are available to veterans, servicemembers and their families through federal programs such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid. In some states, undocumented students are required to pay higher, out-of-state rates for their education, even if they have lived in that state most of their life, Bloemraad said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Medical care The Emer­gency Med­ical Treat­ment and Active Labor Act, enacted by Congress in 1986, provided that hospitals provide anyone emergency care until stabilized, said Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. So undocumented immigrants, by law, can get immediate emergency care -- but so can veterans. In this regard, both groups are treated the same in case of medical emergencies. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Veterans enrolled in the Veteran’s Affairs health care system (about 9 million of the 22 million veterans) are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act, but others would be -- unless they are eligible or have other coverage such as Medicare or employer-sponsored insurance, Wilensky said. Still, veterans are eligible for medical care. It’s "hard to think of an example where an illegal immigrant would get better care," Wilensky said. Some of the Veterans Affairs care is clearly substandard or delayed, but that’s a different problem, she said. Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard University, said there are limits to the programs and care available to undocumented immigrants. They are not eligible for Medicaid, for instance, she said. Veterans are eligible for Medicaid and those who qualify usually do not pay copays for Veterans Affairs health care, according to the Veterans Affairs Department. "I can't think of ways in which veterans have less access or lower quality care than undocumented immigrants," Baicker said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Taxes, Social Security Veteran’s benefits generally are not subject to tax and many tax provisions benefit service members, said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Pay earned while serving in a combat zone is exempt from federal income tax, he said. "I can't think of any tax issue that would hit troops harder than undocumented immigrants," Williams said. Veterans are entitled to Social Security benefits. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, according to the Social Security Administration. As the Associated Press has also noted, undocumented immigrants don’t have the right to vote, don’t have legal permission to work or to receive most government benefits. Veterans who are citizens have the right to vote, have job employment resources such as the Veterans Employment Center and may qualify for Veteran Affairs health benefits. Overall: Advantage veterans. Our ruling Trump said, "Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants." In some states undocumented immigrants are barred from enrolling in post-secondary institutions, or pay out-of-state tuition even if they’ve lived in that state most of their lives; veterans are eligible for federal benefits for higher education and training and are eligible for in-state tuition. Undocumented immigrants also aren’t eligible for Medicaid, cannot buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act and cannot receive Social Security benefits, all of those services and benefits are available to veterans. Veterans also have the right to vote and are eligible for federal job placement resources. Veterans are entitled to several more benefits that are not offered to civilians, much less undocumented immigrants.

pomt-02377	Dan Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/17/david-dewhurst/dan-patrick-once-called-regular-gas-tax-increases-/	State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, the conservative radio talk-show host who led Republican primary balloting for lieutenant governor, has not been stumping on a raise-your-taxes platform. Yet his opponent in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the nomination, incumbent David Dewhurst, aired a TV ad before the March primary in which the narrator declares that Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax." He did? By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us a backup document for the ad including excerpts from news stories published in 2009 and 2011 quoting Patrick as supportive of higher gas and sales tax rates. Also by email, Patrick campaign spokesman Logan Spence pointed out entries on Patrick’s campaign website characterizing the tax claims as misrepresentations. Hiking either tax would be a big move. Lawmakers last raised the state gas or motor fuels tax, of 20 cents a gallon, in 1991 and last increased the statewide sales tax, to 6.25 percent, in 1990, the House Research Organization noted in a March 11, 2011, report. We searched the Nexis database for relevant news stories on Patrick's positions on the taxes. Gas tax In the 2009 legislative session, Patrick resisted a push by Sen. John Carona, R-Dallas, and others to offer voters in Dallas, Harris and other urban counties the option of raising gas tax rates by up to 10 cents a gallon locally toward paying for local transportation projects. During Senate floor debate, Patrick told colleagues the option would burden taxpayers. "I didn't come to Austin to be in this Senate to raise taxes over and over again on my constituents," Patrick said, the Dallas Morning News reported in an April 9, 2009, news story. That day, Patrick was on the losing end of a Senate vote for a proposal including the local-option tax increase, but the tax option never did make it into law. Five months later, as noted by Dewhurst’s camp, Patrick told a forum of Houston-area residents he would back regular statewide gas-tax hikes. Specifically, a Sept. 17, 2009, Houston Chronicle news story quoted Patrick as saying that he supported a slight increase to the state's gas tax and then annual one-cent increases to generate money for state transportation projects. "I want the whole state involved" in paying for transportation needs, Patrick said. We found no evidence of Patrick raising that idea again, while in February 2013, he declined to opine on increasing the gas tax after Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, said he was going to be brave by supporting an increase. According to a Feb. 26, 2013, Associated Press news story, Patrick, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, "passed on the question, saying his head had been buried in education." During a February 2014 candidate forum, Patrick floated another way to raise money for transportation projects by saying he favors dedicating revenues from the state’s vehicle sales tax to future highway funding, the Chronicle reported Feb. 6, 2014. Sales tax From June 2008 into May 2012, news stories show, Patrick spoke in favor of increasing the state sales tax. Almost always, he said money generated by such increases should be spent to reduce property taxes. A June 24, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news story, echoed in a Jan. 8, 2009, Chronicle news account, quoted Patrick as saying: "We need to fund our schools for the long term, and the best way to do this is through sales tax." The Statesman story said Patrick had previously called for repealing the state’s business margins tax while boosting the sales tax 2 percentage points and also charging sales tax on some items then exempt from the tax. The story did not list particular items. Such an increase would generate an estimated $6 billion a year, the Statesman said. The story also said: "Many Republicans, including Patrick, have long embraced the idea of relying more on the sales tax to pay for government services. At its convention this month, the Texas Republican Party included abolishing the school property tax--to be replaced with the sales tax and spending cuts--in its platform." Patrick told the paper: "The fairest way to tax people is on what they consume and their ability to pay, not on where they live." Another instance: Patrick said during a 2010 committee meeting that he favors a sales tax increase to fund public education instead of relying on property tax revenue, the Chronicle reported Sept. 17, 2010. "The homeowners and the commercial business owners can't stand much more," Patrick said, noting that all consumers would directly contribute to public education if the funding source shifted from property to sales taxes. According to a Sept. 6, 2011, Chronicle news story, as noted by Dewhurst's camp, Patrick suggested a two-cent state sales tax increase, which he said would generate enough revenue to make up for $5 billion in school-related reductions put in motion by the 2011 Legislature. According to the story, Patrick told a local group he wouldn't suggest more of an increase because if the rate goes too high, it begins to affect commerce in the border counties. "Right now you have 4.5 million homeowners paying for education," Patrick said. "I'd rather have all 21 million (residents) contributing to the cost of education." Reporters for the Houston newspaper wrote conflicting interpretations of Patrick’s remarks with a Sept. 2, 2011, Chronicle news blog post stating that Patrick wasn’t saying to the local group that revenue from increased sales taxes should be spent making up for cuts in school aid. According to the blog post, Patrick was proposing "to tie a sales-tax increase to a property-tax reduction of somewhere between 5 and 10 cents" per $100 valuation. A May 18, 2012, news story in the Morning News mentioned Patrick’s earlier call for a two-cent sales tax increase to cover lowered school property taxes. "What we have seen over the years is that tying the system to the property tax has not worked very well," Patrick said. "We have to find a steady stream of revenue that keeps up with the growth and the needs of our state." We did not spot more recent news stories about Patrick pitching higher sales taxes to lower property taxes, while a video posted by his campaign suggests he’s not seen a sales tax plan that he would champion. In Patrick’s video, posted online Feb. 9, 2014, Patrick reads aloud a voter question about why he doesn’t favor eliminating property taxes entirely by raising the sales tax. "We need to move more to sales tax, away from property taxes, for really our main source of funding our government and our schools," Patrick says. But he also says there are ways to achieve as much solely by eliminating existing sales-tax exemptions while preserving exemptions on food and medicine. "If there’s a model presented to me and the Legislature where we think we can actually do that, then I’m all in favor of that," Patrick said. "I haven’t seen the model yet, but I’m a sales tax, I’m a sales/consumption tax guy. So, let’s move away from property taxes." Summary Summing up: Patrick opposed a local-option gas tax proposal before calling--in a 2009 appearance--for regular statewide jumps in the tax to bolster transportation projects. Far as we can tell, he did not repeat that call. From 2008 into 2012, meantime, Patrick consistently advocated higher sales taxes to pay for lowering property taxes, though he recently said he hasn’t warmed up to a particular tax-swap plan. We failed to win an interview with Patrick to discuss his tax views over the years. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax." Both parts of this claim are correct, but clarifications are missing. Patrick piped up once for regular gas tax increases, in a 2009 talk, also making it clear that related revenue should pay for transportation projects. Similarly, his consistent calls for higher sales taxes have almost always been linked to reductions in property taxes, a detail this claim doesn’t cover. Finally, Patrick has not made increasing either tax a theme of his campaign for lieutenant governor. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

pomt-05658	Because of the new health care law, "Americans no longer will see their coverage dropped or capped when illness strikes."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/19/barack-obama/film-promoting-barack-obama-claims-new-law-ensures/	You may remember hearing the horror stories of people who saw their medical coverage revoked once they became seriously ill. For instance, during congressional testimony in 2009, a nurse from Texas told of losing her coverage after being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer because she had failed to disclose in her insurance application that she had once visited a dermatologist for acne, the Los Angeles Times reported. Such stories provide the background for a claim in The Road We’ve Traveled, a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. The film touts Obama’s achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans. The film claims that as a result of Obama’s policies, "Americans no longer will see their coverage dropped or capped when illness strikes." We decided to check to see whether that was correct. In the widely publicized (and criticized) practice, health insurers used sometimes innocent or inadvertent mistakes by applicants to retroactively rescind their coverage. Furthering public outrage were revelations that these was not merely rogue practices but, at least at certain companies, pervasive policies. According to congressional testimony, employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses, the Los Angeles Times reported. This issue was confronted head-on in the 2010 health care law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama, according to a summary of the health care law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The law has already begun to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing "lifetime limits on the dollar value of coverage" and prohibit insurers from "rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud." Beginning in January 2014, the law is scheduled to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing annual limits on the dollar value of coverage. (Prior to that date, plans may impose annual limits on coverage only according to limits set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.) Whereas the old practices allowed companies to comb policies for inadvertent omissions and minor breaches of the fine print, the new law sets a higher threshold -- fraud -- that would be harder, though not impossible, for companies to prove. On the surface, then, the ad would appear to be accurate. However, we think there’s a bit of context that’s worth noting. The law doesn’t explicitly stop companies from imposing limits on the number of visits to doctors, physical therapists and the like. This may be dealt with once an "essential health benefits package" is created by 2014 -- a package that would serve as the minimum list of services available with plans purchased on the health care "exchanges" that are to be set up by the health care law. But since the elements of this package have not yet been determined, we don't know whether the package will ultimately include a ban on limiting physician visits. This lack of certainty weakens the film’s claim that Americans will "no longer will see their coverage … capped when illness strikes." Second, it’s worth noting that the number of people who experienced revocations of their insurance was quite small. Typically this only happened to people with individually purchased insurance policies, and even within that group, the rates were small. We looked at the study that served as the statistical basis for the congressional hearings we cited earlier. It was produced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the group of state-based officials who regulate insurance. The group found that in the five-year period from 2004 to 2008, the annual number of rescinded policies averaged 5,449 per year, ranging from a high of 7,004 in 2005 to a low of 4,818 in 2007. To put this in perspective, 28.5 million people in 2008 had individually purchased insurance -- the only kind for which people had to worry about getting their insurance revoked -- while 202.6 million had private insurance of any type, according to the Census Bureau. So, fewer than two of every 10,000 people who held individually purchased policies in 2008 saw their insurance revoked that year, or about two of every 100,000 people who had private insurance of any kind. Our ruling The film is largely accurate that Obama’s health care law makes it all but impossible for health insurers to revoke their beneficiaries’ policies for anything short of willful fraudulence. But the law hasn’t yet entirely closed the door on limiting beneficiaries medical services. And it’s worth noting that, their media profile notwithstanding, there weren’t a large number of people who experienced revocations every year. Their number was far smaller than, say, those hurt by pre-existing condition rules, or those left uninsured after graduating from college -- the other two claims the film makes about Obama’s health care law. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-03-19T16:31:10	2012-03-16	['United_States']
pomt-10688	"This guy didn't even support Ronald Reagan."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/rudy-giuliani/hitting-him-where-it-hurts/	Among GOP primary voters, the name Ronald Reagan is sacred. So, it's not surprising that each Republican candidate for president has done his best to claim Reagan's mantle and position himself as heir to his legacy. Rudy Giuliani, the only GOP candidate who says he supports abortion rights, might have the hardest time making that sale, since Reagan's legacy is so wrapped up in his socially conservative views. Even so, Giuliani has made much of the past statements of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has admitted he did not always support the Gipper. The Romney admission in question, like much else Romney has tried to bury in his past, came in a 1994 Senate debate when Romney faced Edward Kennedy. The topic was economics. Kennedy said: "And under your economic program, under the program of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, we saw the growth in terms of the unemployment, the growth in the number of children living in poverty, the growth in terms of those children out of wedlock." Romney responded: "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Romney has since gone out of his way to distance himself from such remarks, repeatedly referencing Reagan in glowing terms on the campaign trail this year and acknowledging his own conversion to social conservatism on hot-button issues like abortion and gay rights. "Now, I wasn't always a Ronald Reagan conservative," Romney told a meeting of conservative activists in January. "Neither was Ronald Reagan, by the way." We find Giuliani correctly characterizes his rival's past statements and find the claim to be True.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-12-11T00:00:00	2007-11-26	['None']
pomt-07254	Says Rick Perry is "the guy that tracked" down Democratic legislators who fled Texas in 2003.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/may/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-rick-perry-tracked-down-democra/	Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh, declaring that Texas Gov. Rick Perry is toying with running for president in 2012, has praised him for opposing abortion and amnesty for illegal immigrants -- and for tracking down Democrats. According to a transcript of Limbaugh’s May 18 program posted online, Limbaugh said: "Rick Perry’s the guy that tracked these Democrats that left the state down. Remember they ran out, just like the Wisconsin Democrats did," a reference to the 14 Wisconsin state senators who left the Badger State for about a month this year in an attempt to stop legislation reducing the collective-bargaining rights of many state workers. Limbaugh, who didn’t respond to an email seeking the backup for that claim, was surely referring to one of two bygone events in the Texas Legislature: when House Democrats hied to Oklahoma in a May 2003 attempt to prevent action on a GOP-steered redraw of the state’s congressional districts, or when Senate Democrats similarly made a July 2003 run to New Mexico. Both flights temporarily kept the respective chambers from having sufficient members to conduct business. Both also ended with the Democrats returning--and Republicans ultimately setting in place revised districts that resulted in GOP candidates capturing a majority of the state’s U.S. House seats. Did Perry track down the departed D’s, as Limbaugh says? News reports from those episodes suggest Senate Democrats were not "tracked" at all since their destination was quickly revealed; before leaving Austin on July 28, some gave interviews on the fact the senators were boarding private planes to Albuquerque. The Houston Chronicle reported the next day that Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate, said that since the senators had left the state, "from a practical standpoint, there's not much we can do." But the earlier surprise departure of more than 50 House Democrats on May 12, 2003, stirred search actions that involved Republican heavyweights including Perry. The Dallas Morning News reported on May 13, 2003, that the Democrats had been found the night before, based on a sighting of a private airplane belonging to former House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center. Laney had boarded his Piper Cheyenne with his pilot on May 12, taking off from Hale County Airport and landing at the Downtown Executive Airport in Ardmore about an hour later, the newspaper said, quoting an airport employee. In a telephone interview, former News reporter Matt Stiles told us he drove to Ardmore from Dallas the same day after a colleague, Pete Slover, twigged the plane’s location. Stiles said he arrived at the Holiday Inn by 6 p.m., recognized Laney and then gathered comments from some House Democrats that became part of the paper’s scoop that evening. The News said that four Texas DPS officers, in plain clothes, also made it to the hotel in the wake of the Democrats. That evening, the newspaper said, the troopers spent most of their time sitting in the hotel lobby, with cars and planes at the ready for transporting anyone who volunteered to return to Austin. The News quoted a DPS captain saying: "We came at the request of the governor's office to make contact and to inform them that their services are still needed in Austin. They have chosen to stay here." The newspaper said the troopers planned to depart by midnight. Next, we contacted Bob Richter, former spokesman for then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. Richter told us that the day the Democrats vamoosed, Perry appeared "gung-ho on getting them back" and "brought a bunch of people together to try to find them." A command post was set up next to the speaker's office. At one point, Richter said, he saw Perry in his office calling out the number on the tail of Laney’s plane. A subsequent Morning News article on May 23, 2003 said that in the early hours of the search, a DPS lieutenant had called the federal Department of Homeland Security seeking the whereabouts of Laney's plane. Homeland Security officials released a partial transcript of the call and said the DPS officer had misled them into believing the plane had crashed, the newspaper reported. According to a May 28, 2003, Houston Chronicle article, House General Investigating Committee Chairman Kevin Bailey, D-Houston said Capitol security tapes showed Perry entering and leaving Craddick’s office on May 12. Bailey also said that Perry's homeland defense coordinator - Assistant Attorney General Jay Kimbrough - gave the DPS a California phone number for Homeland Security’s air interdiction service, which tracks terrorists and smugglers. The governor wasn’t the only one looking for the Dems. U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, then the House majority leader, said his staff asked the Federal Aviation Administration to find Laney’s plane, according to the May 23 Morning News story. The report quotes DeLay saying that when he learned the plane was en route from Ardmore to an airport north of Austin, he passed the information to Craddick. The San Antonio Express-News reported June 5, 2003, that Perry at one point directed a DPS official where to send Texas Rangers to hunt for two missing Democrats -- an order that the newspaper said "directly contradicts the governor's longstanding contention that he wasn't involved in the DPS search for Democratic lawmakers who fled Austin to kill a congressional redistricting bill." According to the newspaper, the DPS official, Lt. Will Crais, described as the ranking officer at the command post set up at the Capitol, testified in a lawsuit brought against.the DPS by a Democratic legislator. The newspaper reported that Crais said Perry "began asking me numerous questions" and eventually ordered that Rangers be dispatched to Galveston and to Brownsville, where it was thought that Rep. Craig Eiland, D-Galveston, and Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, were hiding. Neither legislator was there. Eiland was in Ardmore and Oliveira was in Matamoros, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from his hometown, the Express-News reported. Perry's spokeswoman, Kathy Walt, told the newspaper that Perry issued no such orders. Throughout, Walt had described the governor as having no involvement in the hunt beyond checking on its status. According to a June 5, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article citing Crais’ testimony, Craddick was the one who told the DPS the missing lawmakers were in Ardmore. Perry’s office didn’t immediately respond when asked about Limbaugh’s claim that he pinpointed the Dems. Craddick issued a statement saying: "That is not correct. Perry was not the guy that tracked the Democrats down." Our sense: Perry was trying to find the missing lawmakers. His homeland defense coordinator and the Department of Public Safety were joined in that effort, which also involved federal agencies, and the governor reportedly directed the Texas Rangers to two Texas cities. But it was a news organization that got to the Democrats first. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2011-05-28T06:00:00	2011-05-18	['Texas', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-03444	Proposed cuts in the House farm bill mean "2 million less people on food stamps, 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/21/barbara-lee/food-stamp-cuts-would-deny-aid-millions-school-lun/	When the House of Representatives voted down the 2013 food bill, cuts in the food stamp program played a central role. The bill as a whole aimed to reduce spending by about $40 billion, with about half of the total coming from a range of nutrition programs. Democrats vigorously opposed the plan. "The price of a farm bill should not be making more people hungry in America," said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during Thursday’s debate. One claim about what the cuts would do to families came earlier in the week from Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. In an interview on MSNBC, Lee said the cuts would mean "2 million less people on food stamps. 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts." Judging by the House vote, 234 opposed versus 195 in favor, that sort of argument was persuasive, although some of the opposition also came from conservatives who thought the farm bill as a whole was too expensive. We thought the claim about the impact on families would bear a closer look. Lee’s office pointed us to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group that generally favors government aid to society’s less fortunate members. That report highlighted a couple of key changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. Among the most significant, the House measure would eliminate something called "categorical eligibility." Categorical eligibility allows states to use one set of criteria for its welfare programs, a move that reduces red tape but also has the effect of granting food stamps to people with incomes or assets slightly above the federal cutoff. The CBPP report cited a 2012 Congressional Budget Office study that said getting rid of categorical eligibility would reduce the program rolls by about 1.8 million people. (About 47.7 million people are currently in the program.) The CBO is the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress. Its analysts also wrote that the change would likely "increase the time required to verify information on SNAP applications, which would probably result in more errors and greater administrative costs." Analysts who think Congress ought to do away with categorical eligibility don’t challenge the CBO numbers. Rachel Sheffield with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, opposes a broad approach to eligibility, as well as a measure called Heat and Eat, which allows states to make what she says are unrealistic allowances for a family’s utility bills. "Loopholes like broad-based categorical eligibility and Heat & Eat have allowed the rolls to swell and should be eliminated," Sheffield said. But that is a matter of policy, not the numbers in the CBO estimate. Sheffield agrees that the number of SNAP participants would decline and in her view, that would be better. In some states, there is a direct connection between food stamps, which go to a household, and free and reduced-price school meals, which go to the children. Basically, in those states, if a family gets food stamps, the children automatically qualify for a break on the price of breakfast and lunch at school. In an analysis of the latest bill, the CBO estimated that reducing the food stamp rolls would mean that about 210,000 children would lose automatic eligibility for the school meals program. However, they might still qualify; they would need to apply separately. So to say that all 210,000 would no longer be able to participate goes beyond the CBO analysis. Our ruling Lee said that cuts in the House farm bill would leave 2 million people without food stamps and remove 210,000 children from the school breakfast and lunch program. Ultimately, both numbers go back to the Congressional Budget Office, which is generally seen as impartial. The CBO analysis largely supports the food stamp rolls reduction, but there is more uncertainty regarding school meal subsidies. She is off a little bit on the 2 million number; it's actually 1.8 million. And, with school lunches, it's uncertain that all 210,000 would no longer qualify.

pomt-13129	"Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-some-states-you-can-cast-early-/	Campaigning in Eau Claire, Wis., one week before election day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had a message for Wisconsinites who voted early for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but now regret it. "Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake," Trump said in the Nov. 1, 2016 speech. Cast your ballot early, take it back and cast a new one? In Wisconsin, if you act quickly enough, you can do it, whether you voted in-person absentee or absentee by mail. The act is known as "spoiling," something that has been permitted in Wisconsin for many years. "It’s something that, prior to this year, very few people have done," Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Of course, 2016 has been unlike most any other election year. And it also applies in reverse -- folks who voted early for Trump could take back their ballots, too. How spoiling works According to a Wisconsin Elections Commission news release issued on the same day of Trump’s speech: Once you have been issued a ballot, whether at the polling place, at the clerk’s office or by mail, you can ask to spoil your ballot as long as the ballot has not been cast and get a new one in the event you make a mistake or change your mind. When voting by mail, spoiling your ballot requires contacting the clerk’s office and requesting a new ballot be sent to you. The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016. Voters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk’s office can go to the clerk’s office and make the request for a new ballot in person. The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting. For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours. Absentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day. That was prohibited by a 2011 state law. Voters in at least three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter’s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the Washington Times, ABC News and Fox News. The National Conference of State Legislatures doesn’t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said. Our rating Trump says: "Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake." As long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, several days before election day -- you can "spoil" your original ballot and cast a new one. At least three other states allow re-voting, too.

pomt-05698	PIP fraud is "$1 billion in fraud."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-pip-fraud-1-billion/	Just about every time Gov. Rick Scott mentioned his goal to reform Florida’s no-fault insurance law this legislative session he includes something else: PIP fraud accounts for $1 billion. He calls it a "fraud tax" on consumers. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, insurance groups and other advocates for change have also used the figure. Scott repeats the $1 billion claim to reporters and interest groups and average Floridians. "We are the No. 1 state for staged auto accidents where people fake an accident," Scott said. "If we don't fix this — it's already $1 billion in fraud — it will go up 30 percent year after year after year." With a cost so central to the push for reform, we wondered where it came from -- and if it’s right. Scott’s communications team pointed us a to presentation outlining the problems with PIP from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Total payments of PIP benefits jumped 70 percent from 2008 to 2010. In 2008, it was $1.45 billion. In 2010, it was $2.45 billion. Reform advocates see it this way: What else but fraud could explain an increase in PIP payouts when the number of drivers stayed constant and traffic accidents have declined over recent years? "Ironically, the number of lawsuits also doubled in the last two years," wrote Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty in a January letter to the editor, "which undermines the entire premise of the ‘no-fault’ legal system." Scott’s press office also pointed us to a December 2011 report from a working group written by the state’s insurance consumer advocate, Robin Westcott, who works for Atwater. This report uses slightly different numbers, based on what is called "direct variable cost," to measure the burden on insurance companies. The direct variable costs include direct incurred losses, money to defend and investigate suspicious claims, commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, and policyholder dividends. This measure does not include overhead expenses and investment income. These costs increased from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $2.7 billion in 2010, creating the $910 million "fraud tax." "There is no other cause attributable for this increase but that of fraud and abuse in the PIP system reflected as a $910,695(000) fraud tax on consumers," the report states. The reports use different data, which may explain their differing measuring points. The Office of Insurance Regulation uses PIP data reported by insurers in early 2011. The CFO report uses numbers from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. We went outside the state and consulted the Insurance Information Institute. By their calculations, Florida’s no-fault insurance law has cost insurers $1.3 billion from 2009 to 2011. The institute did not have a comparison for 2008-2010. The group adjusted its estimate for the rising cost of health care by incorporating the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. We should note that the $1.3 billion estimate includes actual data through the second quarter of 2011, so part of it is an estimate. So, if you ask the insurance industry and its self-reported data on PIP payouts, Scott’s right. Some say it's not all fraud Ask the other side of the bitter PIP reform fight and you’ll get a different perspective. Opponents of insurers in the PIP fight -- mainly lawyers -- told us they questioned the methodology of both measurements of the $1 billion Scott mentions. Florida Justice Institute officials pointed us to a college professor’s analysis of the Office of Insurance Regulation’s data. Florida State professor Lorilee Medders dinged the agency’s data for being voluntarily submitted by companies and unaudited by the Office of Insurance Regulation. Beyond that, though, lawyers say there could be other reasons besides fraud for the increased payouts. A big one: the economy. Russel Lazega, a personal injury attorney who represents hospitals and emergency rooms across the state, as well as a small insurance company, said he’s seeing more middle-class clients file PIP claims. Normally they might have eaten the cost of medical care and missed work for fear of increased premiums. These days, he said, they can’t afford to pay out-of-pocket for care and have to file claims. "Now they don’t have a choice," said Lazega, a critic of the changes Scott supports. Lazega added he represents St. Petersburg emergency rooms and hospitals trying to get trauma bills paid. "I have a hard time wrapping my head around where they come up with a $1 billion number," he aid. Kim Driggers, a Tallahassee attorney who represents chiropractors and works with the Florida Justice Association, called the notion of "$1 billion in fraud" an overreach. "Just because more in benefits were paid in a year certainly does not mean every dollar spent was on a fraudulent claim," she said. "It’s not like the CFO went out and said here’s $1 billion I was able to recover in fraudulent claims being filed," she said. "That to me would be a fraud ... the ones that you put in jail, the ones that you prosecuted, because those are the crooks that were caught that were scheming the system." These lawyers acknowledge fraud is out there but agree the industry is overstating and oversimplifying with their cries of fraud. "He (Scott) can show a correlation but that’s a hell of a long way from causation," said Bill Newton, a member of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud's board of directors and executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network. He has criticized Scott’s preferred reform for PIP as a gift to insurance companies. Other voices You won’t hear the $1 billion thrown around by PIP reform’s sponsor in the Senate, Joe Negron, a Republican from Stuart. "I haven’t seen strong evidence to verify that," Negron said in an interview. "People are mixing fraud and over-utilization. They mean different things to me." To Negron, a trial lawyer, fraud means billing someone for services you don’t receive. Over-utilization, though, means billing someone for services you received but did not need, such as visits to massage therapists and chiropractors. Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, also working on the PIP issue, said he leans with Scott: requiring insurers to pay for unnecessary services is fraud. "I think there’s a nexis," he said. Robin Westcott, the insurance consumer advocate, said the $1 billion "fraud tax" total in her report could more accurately be described as a "fraud and abuse tax," which was her intent. Still, she said, "something’s gotta be wrong about this." The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recently released unaudited 2011 data showing more escalation in PIP losses -- $1.4 billion since 2008. Our ruling Scott has industry data on his side when he uses the number $1 billion, but it’s not clear to us that all of that money is caused by fraud. Those opposed to PIP reform put forward interesting arguments that the economy might be driving some of the increase in payouts, to people who otherwise might have paid for care on their own if they could afford it. Nevertheless, most people following the issue agree that fraud is a factor of increased PIP payouts by insurers. The question is how much, and it’s not crystal-clear.

pomt-06279	President Obama plans to "impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries."	false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/22/national-taxpayers-union/taxpayers-group-says-obama-plans-impose-23-percent/	President Barack Obama plans to "impose a tax of at least 23 percent on Medicare’s prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries," a group says. The National Taxpayers Union, which generally advocates lower taxes, featured the Obama claim in a half-page advertisement in the Nov. 13, 2011, Dallas Morning News brought to our attention by a reader. We’re all familiar with Obama’s 23 percent Medicare tax. Oh, wait. We’re not. Pete Sepp, the taxpayers’ union spokesman, told us in an interview that the "tax" in the ad refers to what the Obama administration has pitched as a money-saving mandate that pharmaceutical drug makers rebate money to the government for prescription drugs sold to low-income Medicare beneficiaries employing the fairly new federal prescription-drug benefit. That benefit also is known as Medicare Part D, which was ushered into place when George W. Bush was president to help elderly Americans afford prescription drugs. Sepp said Obama’s proposal amounts to a "mandatory extraction that functions like a tax." As noted in an October 2011 article in the journal Health Affairs, Obama in September proposed a $3 trillion package of savings including $320 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings. The bulk of the suggested savings involved reduced payments to hospitals and other providers, the article says, but an element ties to requiring Medicare to receive rebates from drug companies for drugs purchased by low-income beneficiaries much like Medicaid has for years. An October 2011 critique of Obama’s proposal, whose authors include Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, points out that since 1991, drug manufacturers have been required to enter into agreements with the federal government to pay rebates to the Medicaid program as a condition of their drugs being covered by Medicaid. The rebate rates are tied to a share of the average manufacturers price for each drug or the difference between that price and the "best price" offered to any payer. Since 2010, the minimum rebate amounts have been set at 23.1 percent of the average manufacturers price for most brand-name drugs, the critique says. So now we know where the 23 percent figure originated. Back to Medicare: The Health Affairs article says that while the federal government has been forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices in Part D, "Democrats and a few Republicans have long looked for other ways to enable the program to capture drug discounts. The Obama plan proposes that manufacturers pay Medicare the same ‘rebates’ for brand-name and generic drugs that they already pay Medicaid for beneficiaries who receive the Medicare low-income subsidy. This option is estimated to save $135 billion over ten years." The Obama proposal states the administration wants to "align" Medicare drug pricing with Medicaid practices. Currently, the proposal says, Medicare Part D insurance plan sponsors negotiate their own rebates and prices for drugs. The resulting rebates reached for brand-name drugs are less than what the government achieves for those drugs under Medicaid, the proposal says, resulting in higher prices in the end. Sepp warned against such rebate proposals in a July 2011 letter to members of Congress, saying they amount to "federally-forced price controls on prescription drugs to certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (who would see no financial gain even as Washington’s coffers got fatter)." His letter says health care providers under Medicare Part D had already "negotiated deep voluntary discounts of 20 to 30 percent from drug makers and pharmacies, saving both enrollees and taxpayers considerable sums." Sepp told us by email that the "money collected from the ‘rebates’ don't wind up in the actual consumers' pockets or the various Part D plans; instead they go to a fund that will defray certain government Medicare program costs. A ‘rebate’ as is commonly understood is something that the consumer of product receives after purchase. This ‘rebate’ is nothing of the kind, and represents deceptive terminology." Also, Sepp said, the sought rebate is based on a percentage of price per unit, "a lot like the way some excise taxes on products such as some tobacco items work." We failed to draw a response from the government on this topic, but outside experts said they’d never heard the Medicaid rebates -- or proposed Medicare rebates -- referred to as taxes. Judith Lave, a University of Pittsburgh professor of health economics and former director of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Policy Center, said the Medicaid rebates help government lower drug prices; the same would be so, she said, if such practices were permitted for Medicare. "To view it as a tax is a bit of a stretch," Lave said. "That is an inappropriate use of the word ‘tax.’ I would say the government plans to use its market power to get lower prices from the pharmaceutical companies." Kenneth Lawson, who heads the University of Texas School of Pharmacy’s Division of Health Outcomes and Pharmacy Practice, said that to the degree drug manufacturers want their products to be available to Medicaid and, potentially, Medicare beneficiaries, rebates could seem like taxes; they have to pay to play. Lawson said, though, that the ad statement misleads by suggesting low-income beneficiaries would bear rebate costs most likely to be spread out in different ways by paying companies. Rebates can cut drug manufacturer profits, he said, and/or the makers could raise drug prices to partly or completely cover the rebates, ultimately shifting the costs to consumers, hospitals, prescription drug plans (including taxpayers who support Medicaid), and other purchasers of medications. So it’s possible, he said, that Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries could be contributing towards the cost of rebates indirectly through the taxes they pay that support Medicare and Medicaid. "Of course," he said, "these rebate costs are spread across a relatively large number of people." The taxpayer union’s Sepp nudged us to a June 2011 paper criticizing Medicare rebate plans by Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute and Guy King, former chief actuary for Medicaid and Medicare. The paper says: "Like a tax, the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers pay a minimum rebate has its initial impact on the manufacturers but the final incidence would be borne primarily by patients, who are the end-users of the prescription drugs." Sepp said by email: "Supporters call this a rebate so they can raise revenues for the federal government without branding their scheme a tax and having to answer a lot of inconvenient questions about it. Just because they don't want to call it a tax doesn't mean it won't function like one." Our ruling We see how the Obama proposal could be judged a nearly mandatory give-back in that drug companies that decline to give rebates would do so at risk to their bottom lines. It also makes sense that drug companies wouldn’t swallow the costs of the rebates; they’re not free. Then again, contrary to the ad's statement, there’s no evidence low-income Medicare beneficiaries would pay a 23 percent "tax." And all told, Obama's urged rebate remains that--money paid in return for a purchase or action/opportunity. One would have to connect more dots to make it a tax. We rate the group’s statement False.

pomt-13940	Says Donald Trump has "bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/	Hillary Clinton mocked Donald Trump’s business failings in a major speech arguing that the presumptive Republican nominee would be disastrous for the economy. "He’s written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11," Clinton quipped, adding. "He bankrupted his companies not once, not twice, but four times." We rated a similarly worded claim from Trump’s former primary rival Carly Fiorina Mostly True, because it’s not accurate to say Trump is solely to blame. (For the record, Trump doesn’t deny the charge and instead argues it was a smart business decision.) At the time, we found four bankruptcies, but since then, we’ve found two more for a total of six. So Clinton was right that Trump bankrupted companies four times, and she could have offered a higher count as well. Let’s go through them one by one. Bankruptcy No. 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 Trump’s first bankruptcy may have hit the businessman, personally, the hardest, according to news reports. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., which opened in 1990, primarily with junk bonds at a whopping 14 percent interest. A year later, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities. So Trump decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy No. 2: Trump Castle, 1992 Within a year of his first Chapter 11 filing, Trump found himself in bankruptcy court again for Trump Castle, which opened in 1985. It was his "weakest gambling hall," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, and ironically faced competition from Trump Taj Mahal. In March 1992, the Castle filed a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, and Trump gave up his 50 percent share in the casino for lower interest rates on $338 million worth of bonds. Bankruptcy No. 3: Trump Plaza and Casino, 1992 The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1984, declared bankruptcy at the same time as the Castle. A $210 million joint project of Trump’s and Harrah’s, the casino had racked up $250 million in debt by 1992, after a staggering 80 percent decline in cash flow. So Trump Plaza filed for prepackaged bankruptcy that spring as well. Bankruptcy No. 4: Plaza Hotel, 1992 Later that year, Trump filed bankruptcy on another Plaza, this one in New York. Trump purchased the Plaza Hotel in Midtown Manhattan for $390 million in 1988, but it accumulated more than $550 million in debt by 1992. In December 1992, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture; he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy No. 5: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy No. 6: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. It declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. Whose fault is it anyways? Experts told us during the primary season Trump alone didn’t cause the bankruptcies. While six in 25 years is a lot, five were tied to a struggling gaming industry. Trump was acting, they said, as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, previously told us. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. "The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space," Levitin said. Our ruling Clinton said, Trump has "bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times." Trump has actually filed Chapter 11 six times, four times within two years in the 1990s, once more in 2004 and once more in 2009. But experts told us Trump shouldn’t bear all the responsibility, as Clinton’s wording suggests, as the majority of bankruptcies happened as the overall casino industry struggled.

pomt-12476	On voting for a health care bill without an up-to-date Congressional Budget Office score	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/04/paul-ryan/did-paul-ryan-flip-flop-how-pass-big-health-care-b/	As legislation to dramatically overhaul the Affordable Care Act neared a vote in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, critics said that Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was hypocritical in how he brought a revised bill to the floor. In March, a bill known as the American Health Care Act was pulled from the floor by GOP leaders because it didn’t have enough votes to pass. That was considered a major defeat for both congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, who had campaigned on the repeal and replacement of President Barack Obama’s far-reaching health care law. Republican leaders adjusted the bill following negotiations with both the conservative and moderate wings of the party. A new version passed the House on May 4 by a 217-213 vote margin. In addition to decrying the substance of the bill, Democrats and other critics took House Republicans to task for seeming to ram the bill through the chamber without adequate procedural safeguards. One concern was that the full text of the revised bill and the relevant amendments was only posted on the Web on the evening of May 3, less than 24 hours before the House was scheduled to vote on it. Another concern was that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan office that analyzes the impact of pending legislation -- had not reviewed the new version of the bill. The CBO had reviewed the original bill, and in doing so, it found that the measure would lead to an additional 24 million Americans being uninsured by 2026, compared to the number who would be uninsured if the current law was still in force. Critics said Ryan and House Republicans were hypocritical for voting on a new version without a new CBO score, and they pointed to Ryan’s past comments as evidence. On June 23, 2009, Ryan signed on to a letter to the then-director of CBO seeking a wide-ranging analysis of the Affordable Care Act, which then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was trying to pass. "We are writing to respectfully request that you analyze the House Democrat bill as expeditiously as possible. ... Before Congress changes health care as the American people know it, we must know the likely consequences of the House Democrat legislation, including the number of people who would lose access to their current insurance, the number of jobs lost due to business taxes, the number of uninsured people who would obtain coverage, and the extent of the cannibalization of employer coverage due to Medicaid expansion." Then, in an appearance on MSNBC in July 2009, Ryan personally criticized the Democrats’ procedural handling of the bill in the House. "I don't think we should pass bills that we haven't read, that we don't know what they cost," Ryan said. We wondered whether Ryan’s past remarks and current actions amounted to a flip-flop, so we sought advice from a range of congressional experts and veterans of House floor action. Generally, we found a sharp partisan divide between those who thought Ryan’s actions in shepherding the health care bill were appropriate and those who did not. But we also found some agreement that members of both parties tend to speak and act differently depending on who’s in the majority and who’s in the minority -- and a measure of agreement that Ryan did not meet the spirit of his 2009 comments in 2017. Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center said the bill did not require a new CBO score, since its previous iteration had already been analyzed by the agency. "CBO is not obliged to score amendments adopted subsequent to a bill's being reported," Wolfensberger said. Wolfensberger added that CBO is expected to do a new analysis of the bill eventually -- but that it would happen after passage. Ryan could have waited for a new CBO analysis before calling for the vote, but it was within his discretion to go forward without a new score. Several Republicans with House floor experience said they have no quarrel with how Ryan has handled the bill. "It is well established that when you are in the minority, you complain about procedure, and when you are in the majority, you complain about partisanship," said John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. "Nothing about Ryan's comment strikes me as unusual or otherwise inappropriate." Glenn LeMunyon, a former floor specialist to then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, agreed. "The opposing side on any legislative matter will always try to make that case, and the media will try to exploit it," he said. "But the truth is that this is very normal procedure. They have taken legislation and crafted it (with additional amendments) in order to gain enough support to pass." LeMunyon said the revised Republican bill "is not some new incarnation of health care policy. It is very similar to that which has been in the works for many months. This is not a situation where cost estimates are a complete unknown at all. Leadership has a very good idea of what it would score and so do all the members, regardless of the complaints coming from the opposition." But congressional experts more aligned with Ryan’s critics say his earlier remarks and his present actions are at odds. Former Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas -- a longtime member of the House Rules Committee -- said Ryan’s positions are inconsistent. "I don’t remember examples of proceeding without a CBO score," Frost told PolitiFact. When asked to consider the argument that the three amendments are simply minor tweaks that don’t merit a separate CBO score, he responded, "Nothing is minor in this bill." And Norm Ornstein, a longtime follower of congressional procedure who has been critical of Republicans from his perch at the American Enterprise Institute, said that "of course" Ryan’s past comments conflict with his recent actions. "This is a giant leap in hypocrisy," he said. Ornstein seconded Frost’s assessment that voting on a bill this far-reaching without a revised CBO score is essentially unheard of. Meanwhile, several of the experts we contacted agreed that situational procedural ethics are rampant in both parties. Pelosi herself faced similar complaints when she was trying to get the ACA passed early in Obama’s tenure. In particular, she was pilloried by Republicans when she told an audience prior to passage, "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy." A Pelosi spokesman said at the time that her words were taken out of context. "She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill," the spokesman said. "Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it." In addition, those sympathetic to Pelosi have said that the House passage of the ACA was done over a much longer period and included more public hearings. The CBO analyzed the ACA or parts of it on more than two dozen occasions in 2009 and 2010. Still, the perception that Pelosi unfairly strong-armed the ACA to passage while ignoring longstanding procedures has helped shape the perception of Ryan’s actions today. "We have been around long enough to know about pots calling kettles black, and shoes being on the other foot," Wolfensberger said. "Neither party has a monopoly on procedural abuses, shenanigans and shortcuts. This is the new normal, and has been for the last few decades -- not deliberative democracy." In other words, the contrast between Ryan’s words in 2009 and his actions in 2017 are par for the course in Congress in recent years. But while Ryan was within his rights to handle the Republican health care bill as he did, his 2009 comments raised the procedural bar in a way that his actions in 2017 did not meet.

pomt-01136	"We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/22/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-college-coaches-are-highest-paid-pu/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is ending his 24-year congressional career with hopes of reforming big-time college sports. Moran, who will retire Jan. 3, recently introduced legislation that would create a congressional commission to look into policies of the NCAA after myriad scandals involving misconduct by coaches and athletes, academic fraud and under-the-table payments. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve "the interaction of athletics and academics" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. "We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses," Moran said in a Facebook post. Today, we’ll take a look at the claim that coaches top the payroll in 40 states. We’ll come back soon with a Truth-O-Meter on Moran’s statement that only 20 big-sport universities have athletic departments that make a profit. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, sent us an email with three articles on coaches’ salaries. One, an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, merely repeated the 40-state statistic as fact. The other two are graphics created by USA Today and Deadspin, a sports website. USA Today compiled salary information for head football and basketball coaches at major Division I schools. Deadspin’s graphic was published in 2013 and uses data from the 2011-12 school year. Reporter Reuben Fischer-Baum considered the public employee pay information for each state and media reports on coaches’ salaries. He found that 40 of the states had coaches at the pinnacle of the pay pyramid among public employees -- 27 were football coaches and 13 were basketball coaches. We ran our own check and also found that coaches, when all of their annually guaranteed compensation is totaled, are the highest-paid public workers in 40 states -- often by a longshot. We compared the 2014 football and basketball head coaches’ salaries listed in USA Today -- showing 107 of them are making at least $1 million a year -- with either salary data bases or the most current news report we could find on each state’s payroll. But there’s a caveat to these raw figures. Many states don’t list coaches as their top earners, even though the coaches’ guaranteed pay may be many times higher than the next-highest paid public employee. That’s because, as a general rule, only a small portion of coaches’ earnings comes from taxpayers or a university’s general fund. The lion’s share comes from money raised by school-affiliated athletic foundations, personal appearance fees, product endorsements, broadcasts and cuts of team revenues. In addition, most coaches are eligible for sizeable bonuses based on their team’s performance. For example, although Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer’s $2.6 million base salary outstrips anyone on the state payroll, he was not included in a list of top-paid public workers published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in September. The reason: Beamer receives no state money and is not in the state salary database of public employees. Virginia’s highest-paid state employee, according to the database, is Ronald Schmitz, chief investment officer of the Virginia Retirement System. He made $786,596 in salary and bonuses during the budget year than ended on June 30. Two years ago, George Mason University basketball coach Paul Hewitt topped the salary list, receiving state pay of $744,750. As for some other high-profile coaches in the state during the last budget year:: University of Virginia football coach Mike London was paid $330,750 by the state. But his total salary, according to USA Today, was $2.3 million plus a possible $700,000 in bonuses. VA basketball coach Tony Bennett’s guaranteed salary was $1.8 million -- $300,000 of which came from state coffers. Virginia Commonwealth University basketball coach Shaka Smart was paid $1.2 million -- $400,000 of which came from the state. We should note that there are other state employees, often hospital physicians, who whose total pay packages are also supplemented by outside earnings. Identifying the top earner in each state is tricky because of inconsistent and incomplete data. Moran and Deadspin, using guaranteed compensation packages to coaches, found 40 states whose highest-paid public employee ran a football or basketball team. The number drops to at most 34, we determined, if only direct state compensation to the coach is considered. The number could be lower because, in most states, we were unable to find online data breaking down the taxpayers’ share of their coaches’ guaranteed pay. Here’s some interesting information we turned up about taxpayers’ direct contributions to the salaries of star coaches in other states: University of South Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier’s guaranteed salary is $4 million -- $350,000 of which comes from the state. Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo is paid $3.9 million, including $399,870 from the state. University of North Carolina basketball coach Roy Williams is paid $1.8 million, including $337,500 from the state. Our ruling Moran said that "in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach." The congressman is correct if we focus on the guaranteed total pay of coaches. But there’s a caveat: State taxpayers usually pay a small share of coaches’ salaries at large universities. Most of the money comes from school-affiliated foundations, endorsements, broadcast contracts and the like. If we only consider the direct taxpayer subsidy to salaries, coaches are the highest-paid public employees in at most 34 states -- and likely less. So we rate Moran’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06744	On serving out his gubernatorial term	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/26/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-no-longer-promising-finish-gubernatorial/	Two weeks out from Election Day 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell had a big lead in the race for governor and was fielding questions about whether he would complete his anticipated term leading Virginia or turn his ambition towards Washington. "Will you make a commitment right now that were you to win on November 3rd, that you will stay for your entire four-year term and not run for President in 2012?" asked Ryan Nobles of NBC12 in Richmond. "Absolutely, I think those are all pipe dreams down the road," McDonnell replied. "You’ll be there from the start right until the end?" Nobles pressed. "Absolutely, we need a full time governor," McDonnell said. Virginia gubernatorial races get a lot of national attention. The Old Dominion and New Jersey are the only states that choose governors the year after presidential elections. There isn’t much else to feed political junkies during these odd years. But the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial race particularly piqued national interest. It came a year after Barack Obama carried Virginia, marking the first time in 44 years a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. Suddenly, reliably-Republican Virginia was recast as a critical swing state presidential politics. McDonnell’s popularity in Virginia created a buzz about his potential for the GOP national ticket in 2012. McDonnell, still seeking to nail down his gubernatorial win, dismissed the speculation. "The candidate doesn’t want to talk about future ambitions, saying he will serve his full four-year term through 2013 if elected," The Virginian-Pilot reported on Oct. 17, 2009. Two days later, during his interview with Nobles, McDonnell said, "You know, there’s a lot of number of national political pundits that are paying an exceptional amount of attention to Virginia. I am running to be governor of Virginia...I am fully committed to four years as Virginia’s governor." A month after his inauguration, McDonnell reaffirmed the pledge. Dispelling rumors that he might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, McDonnell told WTOP Radio on Feb. 23, 2010: "I am absolutely planning to serve for four years." McDonnell’s response changed earlier this year when asked, for the first time, whether he would be interested in joining the GOP ticket in 2012 as the vice-presidential candidate. "What if the party’s nominee.. came to you and said ‘for the betterment of your party and your country, I need you to serve as my running mate." Nobles asked during a February 21 interview this year. "Wouldn’t that be a difficult thing for you to turn down?" "Probably," McDonnell replied. McDonnell then stressed that he was honored to be governor and was not seeking to join the national ticket. McDonnell expressed outright interest in the No. 2 spot in a Politico story that ran Aug. 15, noting the his popularity in Virginia and his recent ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association. "I’d be very interested," McDonnell was quoted as saying. "It is a swing state. I’m not asking for the call. I’m not looking for the call. As I’ve said many times, I’ve got the best job in America. But I think anybody who is in public life, if a presidential nominee called him and said, ‘I need your help to win,’ it would be a tremendous honor. … We’ll see. It’s going to be seven, eight, nine months before any of these decisions are made." . The next day, McDonnell was accused of reneging on his promise to serve out his term by David Mills, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia. "Virginians deserve an answer: Is McDonnell just a flip-flopper who won’t stand by his word if it interferes with his personal political ambitions? Or did he knowingly mislead Virginia voters?" Mills said in a news release. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, told us: "The governor’s position has been absolutely consistent on this issue. He is fully committed to serving the people of Virginia. He is planning to serve the full four years of his term." Martin said the vice-presidential talk "is a hypothetical conversation about a possible phone call that couldn’t even happen until a year from now. You can’t change your position on something that hasn’t happened." But McDonnell is no longer promising to finish his gubernatorial term. He has put out word he is interested in being nominated for vice president next year. That’s a Full Flop!	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2011-08-26T06:00:00	2011-08-15	['None']
pomt-07263	"Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board."	true	/florida/statements/2011/may/26/jeff-brandes/st-petersburg-republican-says-he-bucked-gop-during/	Members of the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club are known for asking tough, pointed and sometimes over-the-top questions of the politicians who speak at their regular luncheon meeting. The May 13, 2011, event -- which was broadcast on WEDU's "Florida This Week" program -- was no exception. We'll cut to the chase. A questioner asked first-term state Rep. Jeff Brandes, a Republican representing District 52 in Pinellas County, if he was a fraud. "When you ran for office, if I recall correctly, you said, 'Now when I get elected, I'm gonna really take that Legislature to the woodshed,' " a man named Thomas Dunn said to Brandes. "But when you got elected, somehow you lost your backbone and you became a lackey if not a lapdog for the speaker. So my question is, when you ran for office, were you a fraud?" Brandes, who ran a campaign commercial vowing to take Tallahassee "to the woodshed," sat back in his chair and chuckled. "That's an interesting question," he started in response. "If you'll go back and watch that commercial, and read it line by line, what you'll see what I said is, for those that want to increase taxes or increase government regulation, we're going to take them to the woodshed. That was the exact line. I know and understand everybody wants me to take everybody to the woodshed, and sometimes it's probably appropriate." He continued: "The reality is, I think I stood up on a number of issues against the speaker and against the governor. I've gotten a phone call from the Governor's Office saying why don't you think welfare recipients should be drug-tested. I believe it's a violation of people's privacy to do that. And I stood up and did that (voted against that). So I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board. That takes a little bit of courage. So to say I have no courage, no backbone, is, I think, a little disingenuous." Brandes repeatedly used the woodshed imagery during the campaign because he used to be in the lumber business -- his family once owned Cox Lumber. He said in the television ad that "high taxes and over-regulation have got to stop so jobs can return. If Tallahassee gets in the way, we're taking them to the woodshed." And at his election night victory party after defeating incumbent state Rep. Bill Heller, he signed blocks of wood. Some Democrats, and apparently Dunn, took the line to mean that Brandes would take Tallahassee to the woodshed on every issue. While that may be a stretch, Brandes did defend his record as being an independent voice in the Legislature in his response. So we decided to check his record from the 2011 legislative session. Turns out, there are examples where Brandes bucked the Republican leadership, and even the entire Florida House of Representatives. Brandes was the lone person in the Legislature to vote against HB 949, a bill that added some licensing requirements for pest control businesses. The bill passed the House 116-1 and the Senate 38-0. Brandes' legislative aide, Nick Hansen, said Brandes voted against the bill because it included additional regulations. Brandes also was the lone "no" vote on SB 650, which allows a mobile home park homeowners association a chance to buy its park outright if the owner is considering changing its land use. The bill passed the House 114-1 and the Senate 39-0. And he opposed the majority of Republicans on several other issues: HB 88: Brandes was one of two Republicans to oppose a bill that put restrictions on the amount of severance pay public employees can receive. The bill passed both chambers. SB 330: Brandes was one of four members of the Legislature and the only Republican to vote against a bill that makes it an election code violation for candidates to falsely say they served in the U.S. military. (Brandes is a former officer in the U.S. Army Reserves who served in the most recent Iraq war.) The bill passed both chambers. HB 661: Brandes was one of four Republicans to oppose a bill that would cap damages in wrongful death cases at nursing homes at $250,000. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. An amendment to HB 733: Brandes was the only Republican to join Democrats in supporting an amendment that would have lengthened an August sales tax holiday. (Two other Republicans initially voted with Brandes, but later changed their vote.) The bill did not pass. And as he said at Tiger Bay, Brandes was one of two House Republicans to vote against HB 353, which requires cash welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Brandes spoke on the House floor that the measure violated people's privacy rights. The bill passed both chambers. Now, Brandes didn't always buck his own party. In fact, he was in lockstep on most of its highest priorities. He voted for GOP bills that prohibit public employees unions from collecting dues through automatic payroll deductions (which ultimately failed), restrict or limit abortions (passed), loosen the state's growth management laws (passed), change election law (passed), and to ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment creating two Supreme Courts (failed). He also voted for the budget. But in this fact-check, we're judging his words. Brandes said: "I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board." Measuring "a lot" can be subjective, but Brandes is right that on two occasions he was the only "no" vote in the Legislature. In other cases, he bucked his party and stood with Democrats. We don't know if that adds up to taking them to the woodshed or not. But we do know it makes his statement True.

pomt-01271	"Families in Del Valle, who are City of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store."	false	/texas/statements/2014/nov/06/delia-garza/delia-garza-says-austin-residents-del-valle-must-d/	Delia Garza, newly elected to the Austin City Council, said during her campaign that Austinites on the city’s southeastern fringe have to leave town and drive to the next county to find the closest grocery store. Garza, who won the District 2 seat representing Southeast Austin, told the Austin American-Statesman for an October 2014 news story that some communities in Southeast Austin lack basic modern amenities. "Families in Del Valle, who are city of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store," Garza said. Del Valle is an unincorporated community that sits on land granted to Mexican nobleman Santiago del Valle in the early 1800s. It has no local government of its own and no official boundaries. But Austin has annexed portions, including the site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (which was founded as Del Valle Army AIr Base in 1942). The site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was annexed by the City of Austin in 1990. After that, most recently in 2013, the city added more Del Valle territory to the east. (Map excerpted from City of Austin map of Austin City Council districts.) According to Google Maps, parts of Del Valle annexed into Austin are 8 to 13 miles southeast of downtown Austin and 15 to 20 miles from Bastrop to the east. So, is Garza right that Del Valle Austinites are closer to a grocery store in Bastrop than a store in Austin? Not so, we found. Some small Del Valle stores offer produce and perishable groceries. Besides, the nearest full-scale supermarket sits 10 miles away in Austin while the closest Bastrop supermarket is more distant. Garza’s backup Garza, asked the basis of her claim, said she learned about local difficulties reaching a major grocery at a September 2014 meeting in the office of Margaret Gomez, who represents the county’s southeastern Precinct 4 on the Travis County Commissioners Court. By phone, Gomez told us Del Valle residents have to drive 20 miles to the nearest grocery store in Austin or Bastrop. She also called the Del Valle area a "food desert." According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a food desert exists if at least 500 low-income city residents live over a mile from a supermarket or if at least 500 rural residents live over 10 miles from one. According to Gomez and Garza, the absence of a grocery store in the area has long bothered residents. According to a November 2010 Statesman news story, Del Valle activist Patricia King collected over 1,300 signatures on a petition to bring a big grocery to Del Valle. The story described King driving to a Bastrop H-E-B for groceries every two weeks. By phone, H-E-B spokeswoman Leslie Sweet told us the company has long received requests for a Del Valle store as it does for stores all over Texas. Sweet said H-E-B leaders consider population and density important criteria when deciding where to build. Checking mileage, talking to residents We were ready to check the distance from the part of easternmost Del Valle also in Austin -- hence, still in council District 2 -- to groceries in Austin and Bastrop, following up with a Del Valle field trip. Using Google Maps, we found that the closest Bastrop H-E-B, on Hasler Blvd. is about 20 miles away while the closest Austin H-E-B, on East Riverside Drive, is less than 10 miles away. Also, the Austin H-E-B on East Seventh Street is about 10 miles from Austin’s most distant Del Valle neighborhood and an Austin Walmart on Slaughter Lane is just over 16 miles away. A Bastrop Walmart is 20 miles away. In our trip to Del Valle, we paused first in Oak Ranch, a three-year-old approximately 350-resident neighborhood near the city limit, built on lands the city annexed in 2003 and 2006. Judy Lollich, Oak Ranch’s community manager, called the lack of a nearby supermarket the neighborhood’s biggest problem and, she estimated, about half of Oak Ranch’s residents, particularly the elderly, buy groceries in Bastrop to avoid Austin’s traffic. Despite the shorter distance to the Riverside H-E-B, she said, that trip can take as long as the one to Bastrop. "Sometimes with (Texas) 71 traffic, going to get an emergency food becomes over an hour’s ordeal," Lollich said. A couple Oak Ranch residents told us they occasionally shop in Bastrop to avoid Austin traffic. Other residents told us they bought groceries at the Texaco Breadbasket near Pearce Lane and Ross Road, a quarter mile from Oak Ranch. We parked at the Texaco to talk to customers. Twelve of 13 queried shoppers (none living in the Austin part of Del Valle) said easy access to groceries is a local problem. Four shoppers reported buying groceries occasionally in Bastrop or knowing someone who did. Inside the Texaco Bread Basket, which is the closest grocery option for Del Valle residents living inside and outside the Austin city limits. (Photo/Dylan Baddour, Austin American-Statesman). Our Ruling Garza said Del Valle families who live within Austin’s city limits "have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store." It may be more stressful to travel to Austin than Bastrop to shop and we can see how the lack of a nearby big grocery is distressing. However, several Austin grocery stores are closer -- by about 10 miles -- than the nearest equivalent Bastrop grocery. This fact makes what Garza said False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-13501	The Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs "were programs that worked" but were "recklessly gutted" by the Obama administration.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/06/donald-trump/trump-says-secure-communities-287g-immigration-pro/	One facet of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s new immigration plan would increase cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies to deport criminals living in the country illegally. "We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program," Trump said in Phoenix on Aug. 31. "We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked." The programs Trump mentioned led to the removal of undocumented criminal immigrants. But they have also been criticized as tools for racial profiling, diminishing trust between communities and police, and for deporting large numbers of immigrants with no criminal record. We wanted to take a closer look at the programs, whether Obama "gutted them," and why there is disagreement on whether they worked. Trump’s campaign did not return our requests for more information. Secure Communities Implementation of Secure Communities began in 2008 under President George W. Bush. The program ended in 2015 when Obama replaced it with a similar enforcement program. Secure Communities resulted in deportations but also stirred up controversy with law enforcement and advocates for holding immigrants without probable cause. Secure Communities was designed to "improve and modernize efforts to identify aliens convicted of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment, and who may be deportable, and remove them from the United States once they are judged deportable," according to ICE. Here’s how it worked: when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s fingerprints and booking information was sent to the FBI, which in turn shared it with the Homeland Security Department. DHS then ran the information through its databases and if there was a "hit," meaning if that person had an immigration record, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the local law enforcement agency were notified. ICE then determined that person’s immigration status and whether or not to deport the person based on the agency’s priorities. ICE could then request a detainer, asking the local agency to hold the individual beyond the point he or she would be released, so ICE could have a chance to transfer the person to federal custody. During the course of this program, ICE’s priority was immigrants in the country illegally who had also broken criminal laws. A 2010 ICE memo outlined removal priorities, with the highest priority including violent criminals. From October 2008 to February 2015, ICE removed 406,441 people from the country, the agency reported. That included 135,726 criminal aliens convicted of Level 1 offenses, such as murder, rape and sexual abuse of a minor. Secure Communities was responsible for 60 percent of all interior deportations in fiscal year 2013 and 73 percent in fiscal year 2014, a Migration Policy Institute analyst testified in December 2015 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. (Interior deportations do not account for border removals.) "Nonetheless, Secure Communities also proved to be highly controversial, because it resulted in a large number of low-priority removals and was seen by many (law enforcement agencies) as damaging to public safety," said Marc R. Rosenblum, who left the institute to work for the Homeland Security Department in January 2016. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that an Oregon county had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment right by detaining her for immigration authorities without probable cause, The Oregonian reported. "It’s hard to call (Secure Communities) a success by any measure except to the extent that you support the violation of our Constitution in order to deport more people," said Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an immigrant advocacy group, via email. In November 2014, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Secure Communities would be "as we know it, discontinued." By that point, Secure Communities had attracted "a great deal of criticism," was "widely misunderstood," and "embroiled in litigation," Johnson said. "Governors, mayors, and state and local law enforcement officials around the country have increasingly refused to cooperate with the program, and many have issued executive orders or signed laws prohibiting such cooperation," Johnson wrote. In his memo, Johnson also announced the creation of the Priority Enforcement Program. That program continues to use fingerprint data, but, as its name suggests, emphasized top priority offenders, such as those who pose a threat to national security. The Priority Enforcement Program also stipulates that ICE cannot ask local law enforcement agencies to detain individuals beyond their release date (detainers can be used in limited circumstances). ICE, instead, can ask to be notified of the release date. One of the issues with Secure Communities was that while it was mandatory nationwide, more than 300 jurisdictions were not cooperating, said Randy Capps, director of research of U.S. programs at Migration Policy Institute. Many refused to comply with the detainers requested by ICE, he said. More than half of the undocumented population lives in places that were not cooperating with ICE as part of Secure Communities, Capps said, which poses a problem for Trump if he is elected president and wants to revert back to the Secure Communities program. "That was one of the main reasons why the Obama administration went to PEP," Capps said, "to try to get some of these local and state police departments back on board." Capps views Obama’s Priority Enforcement Program as a revision, and not a gutting, of Secure Communities. ICE still does fingerprints and issues notices, he said, even if it does not also ask local law enforcement for detainers. Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said Secure Communities was effective because it was able to link DHS and FBI databases so that ICE and local law enforcement agencies could be notified when noncitizens were arrested. "The result was that ICE was able to identify and remove more criminal aliens than ever before," Vaughan said. "Local law enforcement agencies no longer had to make a judgment call on whether to seek information on an inmate’s immigration status, it was done automatically (which thwarts racial profiling), and they no longer had to make manual queries of ICE, which saves time and resources." 287(g) The other program Trump wants to expand, "287(g)," stems from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The act added section 287(g) allowing ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies and train officers to carry out immigration law enforcement functions. ICE has these agreements with 32 law enforcement agencies in 16 states, including Florida, Texas and Arizona. ICE credits the program for identifying more than 402,000 "potentially removable aliens" from January 2006 through Sept. 30, 2015. The program has had two enforcement models: a task force, where officers patrolling the streets could approach and process "removable aliens," and a jail model, allowing officers in state and local detention facilities to process removable aliens charged with or convicted of an offense. Capps, from Migration Policy Institute, says 287(g) has a mixed track record. There were allegations of racial profiling early on, particularly in the small number of jurisdictions using the task force model, when officers could ask someone about their immigration status on the street, Capps said. In 2009, DHS decided not to renew the task force model agreement with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hard-line immigration stance. The Obama administration decided in 2012 to end the task force model. As a result, trained local police can only question people about their immigration status after they are booked into jail, Capps said. In December 2011, DHS said the Justice Department found "discriminatory policing practices" within the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and terminated the county’s jail mode agreement. Vaughan says local agencies have wanted 287(g) because "they had so many criminal aliens that ICE couldn’t handle the workload by itself," and because they were too far from ICE offices to be able to arrange regular pickup of criminal immigrants. "I believe that the Obama administration’s suppression of this program has contributed to the steep drop in interior enforcement," Vaughan said. Interior removals went down about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, according to ICE data. Interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s focus on border apprehensions and removal of undocumented immigrants threatening public safety, analysts have told us. Our ruling Trump said Secure Communities and 287(g) immigration programs "were programs that worked" but were "recklessly gutted" by the Obama administration. The programs have led to the removal of criminal immigrants living illegally in the United States, and the Obama administration did scale down their scope. Yet the programs have been criticized for allowing officers to racially profile minorities, a federal judge found Fourth Amendment violations in one of them, and federal reviews have found discriminatory practices in the other. While the programs have removed criminals from streets, they’ve also involved unlawful practices. Given the ambiguity of their outcomes, we rate Trump’s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1318e101-9ad1-48f1-b146-78a1b1dd980f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-06T17:17:36	2016-08-31	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-09367	“This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/30/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-cites-complaint-against-democratic-/	GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign excels at producing provocative videos, the latest one attacking Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White with excerpts from Texas TV newscasts about a Republican complaint against White. A link to the “Liberal Bill” video went to reporters on Friday accompanied by this message: “This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.” Undisputed: Such a complaint was filed by the Perry-allied Republican Party of Texas. The commission hasn't ruled on it. Unproven: Perry's characterization of White as "liberal." That label, which isn't backed up in Perry's statement or the video, might not reflect White's record. For now, we'll let the word slide as a rhetorical swipe. Our lingering question: Did White fail to report more than $83,000 to the state, as Perry's campaign says? In a March 23 complaint to the Texas Ethics Commission, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party, states that White’s state-required personal financial statement, submitted in February, lists no income received in 2009 from Wedge Services, LLC though White separately reported $83,677 in wages from Wedge Services on his 2009 federal tax return. White acknowledges that his tax return, which he recently made public, specifies his Wedge Services’ income as part of “Wages Received and Taxes Withheld.” He also admits that his personal financial statement doesn’t have an entry showing Wedge paying him. But, White says, there’s a reasonable explanation; he wasn’t required to detail his Wedge Services’ income—which was deferred compensation—on his personal financial statement in the way it's spelled out on his tax return. White last worked for the company in 2003. While there's no one entry on the financial statement showing Wedge Services paying White, his campaign says the income came from a brokerage account, invested in stocks and mutual funds, that was established for his deferred compensation. We confirmed that a list of the stocks and funds provided by White's campaign is on his ethics filing. While it's possible to estimate how many shares of stock White's family had in five entities plus the number of shares he had in three mutual funds, the form doesn't show the total value of such holdings or precisely how much income they produced. But proceeds are shown in categories such as $5,000 to $9,999. The categories enable anyone (provided they get help from the White campaign identifying relevant stocks and mutual funds) to estimate that White took in $36,500 to $94,992 in 2009 due to his holdings in the Wedge-originated brokerage account. In a March 25 sworn statement, White states the “proper recording” took place with the commission based on instructions for filing the statement and conversations with commission attorneys before and after the filing. Confusing? There's a reason. The Texas law governing personal financial statements doesn’t speak explicitly to reporting deferred compensation. Broadly, the relevant section (which runs about 900 words) states that each statement must reflect the filing individual’s financial activity in the preceding calendar year including a list of “all sources of occupational income." Filers must identify any person or group from which they received fees or retainers paid in advance of future services. They also must report income from stocks, bonds, notes and other commercial paper, plus each source of more than $500 from interest, dividends, royalties and rents. There's more to report, according to the law, but there's no mention of deferred compensation. We found no past commission opinions on whether filers have to specify income from deferred compensation. Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on ethics law, agreed there's nothing on the record. "That's a new one on me," Wood said. Could White have reported the money from Wedge Services to the state in the same way he did on his federal tax return anyway? Of course—if only to avoid shots like the one fired by the Texas GOP. Not the point, his campaign said, stressing that White consulted accountants to make sure he complied with the law. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said a CPA for White spoke to an attorney for the ethics commission the day after the GOP filed its complaint. Bacon said Robert Mannas, an assistant general counsel for the commission, told the CPA, Nancy Wakefield, that White had reported his income correctly. Bacon said the commission's general counsel, Natalia Luna Ashley, later cautioned that Mannas's advice didn't constitute a ruling on the complaint. Commission spokesman Tim Sorrells declined to comment on Bacon's account. Generally, Sorrells said, whether anyone has complied with relevant laws and commission rules is a call for the agency's eight appointed commission members to make. So, where does this leave Perry’s statement? White does face a complaint, but Perry's statement leaves out a key piece of context: That complaint was filed by the GOP. And it's misleading to conclude, as Perry's statement does, that White failed to report more than $83,000 to the commission. White's camp said he accounted for his deferred compensation as directed. The law doesn't specify if or how candidates should report deferred compensation. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-03-30T21:12:28	2010-03-26	['None']
pomt-09313	Says the new health care law delivers a "$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/apr/18/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-families-special-needs-childr/	The White House and most congressional Democrats have touted the nation's new health care reform law for extending insurance to those who have historically struggled to get coverage. Meanwhile, an opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, says it will slap higher taxes on families with children who have special needs. "$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs thanks to Obamacare," Carter said in an April 12 Twitter message that links to the House Republican Conference blog, where a series of "ObamaCare Flatlines" posts started appearing shortly after President Barack Obama signed the health care legislation in March. Carter is the secretary of the conference, which consists of every Republican House member. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, from Illinois, also sent his Twitter followers the tax blast. "An estimated 30 million families use pre-tax dollars in flexible spending accounts (FSA) to pay for routine medical care and other vital child care services," the conference's April 9 post states, going on to note that those families include parents with special needs children who use their pre-tax FSA dollars to pay fees related to their child's education. "ObamaCare burdens these families with a huge tax increase," the post continues, because the law caps the money a person can put in their flexible spending account at $2,500 per year. A $13 billion tax increase on families with special-needs children? Creighton Welch, Carter's press secretary, pointed us to a March 20 report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that estimates the flexible spending cap will generate $13 billion in revenue by 2019. The committee advises Congress on tax policy. Welch said the reference to "30 million families" using flexible spending accounts comes from the right-leaning Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director, Ryan Ellis, told us the statistic came from the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. Yet the institute, which doesn't take positions on policy issues, told us it couldn't vouch for the number. An industry estimate from the companies that administer the programs for employers is about 30 million, according to a June article by Kaiser Health News, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy. Some employers offer their employees the choice of signing up for flexible spending accounts. Those employees send a portion of their pay to an account that can be tapped for certain medical expenses. Employees bank the dollars tax-free, thus reducing their taxable income. The GOP conference cites several examples of medical expenses parents with a special child could pay for with their flexible spending account, including Braille books. Some other existing restrictions on the savings accounts: In most cases, employees have to save all medical receipts and submit them to an administrator. And they must spend the entire balance; if there's money left in the account at the end of a year, their employer keeps it. For that reason, beneficiaries tend to use the accounts for routine health expenses they know will come due, not emergencies. They're a reliable way to fund co-pays, dental care and special procedures that can be scheduled to match an account holder's accumulated contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also can benefit significantly. The new health care law includes a provision that will cap flexible spending accounts at $2,500 per year, starting in 2013. There currently isn't a federal cap, though the institute says some employers limit how much their employees can put in their accounts. Typical limits range from $2,000 to $5,000. The $13 billion reflects the additional income tax revenue the government expects to reap during the seven years from 2013 through 2019 due to some employees with flexible spending accounts incurring more taxable income. Experts we spoke with didn't quibble with that number. But some cast the provision as shrinking a tax break, not raising taxes, because technically it imposes no tax on people who use flexible spending accounts. Leaving aside the argument over whether shrinking a tax shelter is the same as a $13 billion tax increase, some people will probably wind up paying more taxes after 2013 when the flexible spending limit kicks in. But will they all be parents of children with special needs, as Carter's message states? Welch said the Republican conference doesn't know, but that "many of the 30 million families that use FSAs have special needs children." Perhaps, but we didn't find data backing up that claim. "When it comes to FSA, we know nothing about who uses them or why they use them," said Paul Fronstin, director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "There's been no research on it other than 20 percent of the population that's eligible (for flexible spending accounts) contributes to them," he said. The average annual contribution to a health care FSA is $1,400, he said — an amount that would not be affected by the new limit. Fronstin said there's no way of gauging how many special-needs families will be affected, but that they won't be the only Americans losing part of their tax shelter. Ellis, from Americans for Tax Reform, agreed there's no data on how many FSA accounts are held by special-needs parents. But he said they'll be particularly affected by a cap because they bear high costs relating to special-needs education. Ellis said he has a friend who uses his FSA to help pay his Down syndrome child's tuition at a special-needs' school in the District of Columbia. Ellis said his friend's employer caps his flexible spending account at $5,000. On the other hand, Rich Robison, executive director of the Federation for Children with Special Needs in Massachusetts, and the parent of two young adults with Down syndrome, pointed out that the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Act (IDEA) requires schools to pay for accommodations a child with special needs may need to obtain a "free appropriate public education." Henry Aaron, an economics scholar at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said he suspects "only a tiny fraction" of the estimated $13 billion tax revenue would come from families with special-needs' children. Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Carter's claim ignores the health law's broader impact: the JCT and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office project that 32 million uninsured will have health insurance coverage by 2016. "Some of those are families with people with special needs," he said. The upshot? Carter's statement that the health care law will smack a $13 billion tax increase entirely on families with children who have special needs defies common sense. At our inquiry, his office backed off the sweep of Carter's Twitter message and conceded they didn't have numbers confirming that special-needs' families would bear the brunt of the tax change. All in all, Carter makes a dramatic, unsupported charge. We rate his statement as Pants on Fire.	None	John Carter	None	None	None	2010-04-18T21:57:08	2010-04-12	['None']
pomt-13084	"Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them ... I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/07/donald-trump/closing-argument-donald-trump-wrongly-says-he-outd/	It's been a long campaign season. At PolitiFact, we've fact-checked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a combined 509 times since they announced their campaigns for president. If you add in the other presidential candidates -- from Lincoln Chafee to Ben Carson to Jill Stein -- the number shoots to 889. That's a lot of words, about a lot of policy and a lot of political attacks. So please allow this last fact-check of the 2016 campaign to be a little different. As Trump made his closing argument in Raleigh, N.C., Nov. 7, he decided to spend a few seconds telling voters that he's a bigger draw than Beyonce and Jay-Z. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them," Trump told the crowd. "And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds." It’s not true. For the sake of argument, let’s take Trump at his word on the size of his crowds. (We do this full-well knowing Trump is guilty of exaggerating the size of his crowds.) "We go to Oklahoma, we have 25,000 people," Trump said in August. "We had 21,000 people in Dallas, we had 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. We get these massive crowds. Look, if (Clinton) had 500 people I would be surprised." Here’s a photo from that Mobile rally: Anyway, if you take Trump as his word, that’s an average of 27,000 for those three big rallies. That’s a good draw. But it’s not Jay Z/Beyonce level. Jay Z last toured in 2014 with Beyonce to promote her self-titled album and his Magna Carta Holy Grail. The couple played 16 shows across North America, and one in Paris, raking in over $100 million in ticket sales. All were sold out and averaged a crowd size of 45,700 per night, according to data assembled by Billboard. The biggest one-night performance drew a crowd of nearly 53,000 while their two-night Paris show topped 147,000. Here’s a photo from their Seattle show, via Wikimedia Commons Beyonce, who wrapped up her $210 million Formation tour in October, performed 49 sold-out shows across North America and Europe. She drew an average crowd of 45,423 per night and a record one-night crowd of 75,106 in Paris this July. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Beyonce and Jay Z campaigned with Clinton Friday in Cleveland at an event that drew about 10,000 people, according to estimates. That's comparable to the size of many Trump crowds but certainly smaller than some of Trump's bigger crowds. To fully vet this bizarre claim, it’s worth noting that Trump’s rallies are free. Tickets to Beyonce in the swing state of Florida cost $40-$275 this year. Based on the latest Billboard numbers, Trump draws crowds similar to Phish. Our ruling Trump said, "Beyonce and Jay Z, I like them, I like them. And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. It's true. I get far bigger crowds." There is no question Trump is fixated on the size of his crowds. And there is no question, this claim -- as it relates to Beyonce and Jay Z -- is incorrect. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7060d01f-ad3c-4c4d-b7d0-3caedef0775c	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-07T17:36:54	2016-11-07	['Jay-Z']
pomt-08050	Proposed federal regulations would affect every street sign in the country	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/01/william-howell/speaker-bill-howell-says-proposed-federal-regulati/	The federal government wants to seize control of the street sign on your corner, warns William Howell, speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates. "The Federal Highway Administration has a proposed new regulation that would unify every street sign in the country," Howell, R-Stafford, said during a Dec. 21 speech to Tertium Quids, a conservative Virginia group advocating small government. "Every street sign -- Main Street, Elm Street -- would have to be the same size," Howell said. "The initial letter could be capital, but all the others would have to be in lower case. The city of Milwaukee said, `To comply will cost us $2 million to put in new street signs.’" In other words, all those signs that say "BROAD STREET" would have to be replaced with ones that say "Broad Street." Howell brought up the signs to promote his pet cause: Passage of a U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation approved by the U.S. Congress. Under the proposed amendment, which Howell will ask the Virginia General Assembly to endorse this winter, a federal act would be nullified if two-thirds of the states passed resolutions demanding so. "What business is it of the federal government what Milwaukee or Richmond...how they want to design their street signs?" Howell said. We wondered if the speaker had his facts right. Howell, who has been trying to build national support for the repeal amendment, said he learned about the regulations from acquaintances. We went to the Internet and found tons of information. The Federal Highway Administration, in an effort that began during George W. Bush’s presidency, proposed new rules for street sign lettering in 2009. They were included in an 864-page volume of proposed and existing regulations for road signs, markings and traffic lights called the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In addition to retiring signs posted in all caps, the regulations in 2012 would increase the mandated size of sign letters -- from the current four inches to six inches -- on roads with speed limits over 25 miles an hour. In 2018, new standards would require signs to be more reflective to enhance their night visibility. The goal, according to the highway administration, is to improve traffic safety. Studies show it is harder to read all-cap signs, and those extra micro-seconds spent looking away from the road increase the odds of accidents, especially for older drivers. Controversy over the regulations began this fall. The New York Post reported it will cost the Big Apple $27.6 million to replace signs. ABC News aired a national report saying it will cost Milwaukee $2 million to change its signs -- the same figure cited by Howell. The Virginia Department of Transportation is studying the impact of proposed regulations and plans to issue a mid-year report. In late November, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood opened a new round of public comment on the proposals and distanced himself from them. "I believe that this regulation makes no sense," he said. "It does not properly take into account the high costs that local governments would have to bear. States, cities and towns should not be required to spend money that they don’t have to replace perfectly good street signs." Let’s review. Howell says proposed federal regulations would require all street signs to be the same size and use capital and lower-case letters. He’s right about the letters, which is the seed of a growing controversy. He’s a bit wrong about the size. The regulations would not require all street signs to be the same size, although they do offer guidelines. But that doesn’t detract from his main point, that Washington is considering regulations affecting every street sign. We find Howell’s statement True.

pomt-12298	Says Johnny Depp died after being apprehended for threatening President Donald Trump’s life.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/27/blog-posting/fake-news-saga-said-depp-threatened-trump-died-fed/	A series of fake news posts that said actor Johnny Depp first threatened President Donald Trump’s life and then died after being caught by federal authorities is yet another fake news saga created by a well-known liberal troll. A June 24, 2017, post on Snoopack.com that read "Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service" said that Depp had talked about assassinating Trump, leading to the actor being detained. The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. Users also flagged a follow-up post on June 24 at WashingtonFeed.com that said Depp was in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during his interrogation. There’s more to the entire saga, according to a number of posts that first appeared on June 22-23 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The website said that Depp, who was taken into custody and held under the Patriot Act, later died from his heart malady, although not before recanting his faith in Islam on his deathbed. None of this is real. TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which created the stories, is run by Christopher Blair. Blair has told us before that he fabricates absurd news posts in an attempt to fool conservative readers with his fake news. His site’s About Us section noted that TheLastLineOfDefense.org "is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth" — but it isn’t. The website has a history of writing multiple posts about far-out events involving famous personalities. It’s published tales of U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy’s fictional son being found dead, Tucker Carlson being assassinated in a car crash, Sarah Palin being run off the road and Ted Nugent faking his own death. These contrived storylines, often barely keeping their own counterfeit details straight among the various posts, end up being passed around on other fake news websites, with no indication that they are made up. That is again the case with Depp, who was not detained by the feds and did not die during questioning. We rate this series of fake posts Pants On Fire!

pomt-04156	"One out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/23/paul-ryan/one-four-kids-and-half-big-cities-dont-graduate-hi/	On Dec. 4, 2012, a month after the presidential election, Republican stars Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio gave speeches at a Washington event that were described as charting a new path for the GOP. Ryan, coming off a defeat as Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, spoke about the government’s response to poverty. He argued that "in most cases, we’re still trying to measure compassion by how much we spend, not by how many people we actually help." The Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman then ticked off a number of poverty-related statistics, including these two, saying: "One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate. Half." Do so many students fail to finish high school? Let’s check both parts of Ryan’s claim. 1 in 4 don’t graduate? We’ll note from the top there are different ways to measure graduation rates, depending on how you account for things such as students who take more than four years to earn a diploma and those who obtain equivalents such as a GED. The National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for education data, calculates something called the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate (AFGR) for students in public high schools. It estimates the rate of public school students who started as freshmen and finished high school within four years -- in other words, those who graduated "on time." (We’ll also note that while the government tracks enrollment for private high school students, it doesn’t track graduation rates. About 15 million students attend public high schools and about 1.3 million attend private high schools; that means about 8 percent of all students are in private high schools.) Ryan press secretary Kevin Seifert cited the most recent AFGR to support the first part of Ryan’s claim -- that "one out of every four students fails to earn a high school diploma." The figures show that in the 2008-2009 school year, the AFGR was 75.5 percent. To express that another way, three out of four high school students graduated on time -- or, as Ryan put it, one in four did not. (Wisconsin, by the way, had the highest graduation rate: 90.7 percent.) Separately, we found that Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, a nonprofit research center and publisher of Education Week, found a nearly identical result using a different calculation. The graduation rate for the class of 2009, the most recent year available, was 73.4 percent. So, the first part of Ryan’s claim is on target -- as far as it goes. It doesn’t take into account public school students who take more than four years to get a diploma and it doesn’t take into account more than a million kids who attend private high schools. Half in major cities don’t graduate? For the second part of Ryan’s claim -- "in our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate" -- Seifert cited a report done by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center for America’s Promise Alliance. Colin Powell, the retired Army general and secretary of state, is the founding chairman of the alliance, which is dedicated to helping children and youth. Again, we’re dealing only with public school students. The April 2009 report, the most recent available, found that 53 percent of public high school students in the nation’s 50 largest cities, including Milwaukee, graduate on time. (The research center also did a separate calculation for the nation’s 50 largest school districts. Milwaukee Public Schools’ high school graduation rate for 2009 was listed at 52.6 percent, ranking 45th.) We also contacted some other national experts on high school graduation. Spokesmen for the Alliance for Excellent Education, which is a partner of the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University; and the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents Milwaukee and 66 other large-city public school districts, said the two sources cited by Ryan are the best and most recent available for public school graduation rates. Our rating Ryan said: "One out of every four students fails to earn a high-school diploma. In our major cities across America, half of our kids don’t graduate." The claim suggests Ryan was speaking about all students, but his figures apply only to those who attend public school. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12236	In Ohio, due to Medicaid expansion, "nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists ... leaving them without the care they need for months or even years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/mike-pence/pence-falsely-ties-medicaid-expansion-disability-w/	Providing more Americans health insurance through Medicaid might sound good in the abstract, but Vice President Mike Pence told a story recently about how it can have unintended and dire consequences. Speaking at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island, Pence said in the state of Ohio -- which expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act -- disabled Ohioans are unable to access care because able-bodied adults have been added to the Medicaid rolls. "Obamacare has put far too many able-bodied adults on the Medicaid rolls, leaving many disabled and vulnerable Americans at the back of the line," Pence said July 14. "Gov. (John) Kasich isn't with us, but I suspect that he's very troubled to know that in Ohio alone, nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists, leaving them without the care they need for months or even years." Is it true that Ohio’s expanded Medicaid system has sucked up state dollars that could have shortened the waiting list for the disabled in Ohio? Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said the vice president was saying that "we need to provide states the flexibility to create systems that best meet the needs of their people." Lotter pointed to a Wall Street Journal op-ed that said the more generous federal reimbursement for Medicaid expansion "diverts resources from the program’s traditional targets." "A temporary enrollment freeze might lead Ohio to prioritize resources for the truly needy," the piece said. What we found is that there are about 60,000 people on county waiting lists across Ohio. But Pence is wrong to create a connection between the programs to help them and Medicaid expansion. Home and community-based service waivers The waiting list Pence mentioned is part of a 30-year-old effort by Washington to give states more options to keep the long-term disabled out of institutions. It’s called home and community-based services, or HCBS. The money can pay for a variety of services, such as adult day care and assistance at home with eating and dressing. States set the number of people who can apply for waivers and Washington picks up between 50 and 70 percent of the cost. That’s less favorable than the 90 percent share that the federal government pays for Americans who receive Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act expansion. Health analyst MaryBeth Musumeci at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source of health care data, told us there’s no escaping these budget realities. "The expansion adults are a less costly population in that they are generally healthier and therefore use less services than someone on an HCBS waiver who by definition has chronic and long-term care needs," Musumeci said. But when Musumeci crunched the data, she found no simple trade-off between expansion and waiting lists. In fact, states that didn’t expand Medicaid were more likely to see their waiting lists grow compared to those that did expand. Point being, Musumeci said, is that there is no relationship between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. Pence also spoke too broadly when he said people were left without the care they need, Musumeci said. Musumeci and her colleagues found that just because someone is on a waiting list, that doesn’t mean they aren’t getting any Medicaid services. According to federal data, 93 percent of people on waiting lists with intellectual and developmental disabilities receive Medicaid services that don’t depend on the waiver process. Further complications As it turns out, the waiting lists in and of themselves don’t always show how many people are going without care. When the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities commissioned a survey of people on the waiting list, it found that over 40 percent said they had "no current area of need." (The study was last updated in 2015.) Part of the problem Musumeci said is that the lists can include people from many years back. Their situations may have changed or some of them would never have qualified for waivers in the first place. The disability community differs with Pence Pence’s claim about Ohio also contradicts the work of advocates for the disabled. In an initial assessment, the National Council on Disability reported in 2016 that "both interview results and available literature suggest that Medicaid expansion has helped people with disabilities." The National Health Law Program, a group that advocates for the legal rights of the poor, agreed. It wrote that "expanded eligibility for Medicaid means that some of people on waiting lists who could not qualify for Medicaid under the traditional categories now access Medicaid services, which includes some community-based services." The group also said that "states expanding Medicaid have saved millions in spending on people with disabilities, savings that could be used to expand HCBS programs." Our ruling Pence said that Medicaid expansion in Ohio left 60,000 people waiting for the services they need. We found no link between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. In fact, studies found that Medicaid expansion increased services for the disabled. They also found that in Ohio, over 40 percent of people on those lists said they had no immediate need for services. In short, the size of the list is not a sound measure of need. One analysis argued that Medicaid expansion frees up state dollars that could go toward reducing the ranks of people on the waiting list. And overall, there is no clear connection between expanding Medicaid and rising waiting list numbers. In fact, non-expansion states were more likely to see their waiting lists grow.

pomt-12851	"In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/02/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-majority-florida-undocumented-imm/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio supports President Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall at the Mexican border but says it won’t address the main path that undocumented immigrants use to arrive in Florida. "In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane," Rubio, a Florida Republican, told reporters while visiting growers in Immokalee Jan. 27. "They overstayed a visa -- the wall isn't going to address that." Rubio, who along with Trump advocated for implementing a system to track visa overstays, is one of many politicians to raise concerns about immigrants overstaying their visas -- in 2015 he said that nationally 40 percent of illegal immigrants had overstayed a visa, a claim we rated Mostly True. But in Florida, is the rate really 70 percent? We found no comprehensive data from the federal government to back up Rubio’s point and his spokespersons didn’t respond. However, a former government official and longtime researcher about the undocumented population came up with an estimate for Florida that was close to Rubio’s number. Visa overstays Although there are legislative requirements to track nonimmigrants’ entry into and exit from the United States, the federal government has struggled to accurately count visa overstays. What we know about the number of immigrants who overstayed their visas nationally is largely based on either recent incomplete data from the federal government or data that is several years old or estimates. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that out of 45 million U.S. arrivals by air and sea whose tourist or business visas expired in fiscal year 2015, about 416,500 people remained in the country in 2016. However, that data only covers a small slice of the undocumented population, capturing one year of data and omitting people who arrived via land. Also, the report did not provide a breakdown by state. In 2006, the Pew Research Center estimated that as much as "45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population entered the country with visas that allowed them to visit or reside in the U.S. for a limited amount of time." That report relied on a 1997 study from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. There have been other estimates of overstays (though they are also old): In January 2003, an INS report said that 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, estimated visa overstays ranged from 27 to 57 percent. Since the U.S. government has not provided an overstay rate for the entire unauthorized population in recent years, the only way to come up with a figure is an estimate. Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 INS report, said that in recent years relatively more immigrants have overstayed their visas than have "entered without inspection." Source: Center for Migration Studies The percentage of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico dropped significantly during the past 15 years -- and that’s a key country for the group of immigrants who cross the border illegally without a visa. Warren, who is now a fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, did some calculations for PolitiFact Florida. Warren used the Center for Migration Studies’ estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Those estimates show about 10.9 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, including 710,000 in Florida. Then Warren examined the number of undocumented immigrants from 148 countries living in the United States and in Florida. He made some assumptions about what percent of undocumented immigrants from various countries overstayed their visa compared with those who sneaked across the border. For example, he estimated that 15 percent of undocumented Mexicans were visa overstayers while most arrived by crossing the border. Meanwhile, 75 percent of undocumented immigrants from the Dominican Republic were visa overstayers, he estimated. Using those assumptions, he concluded that in Florida an estimated 430,000 of 710,000 undocumented immigrants -- 61 percent -- were visa overstayers. It’s not a surprise that Florida’s undocumented immigrant population would include a higher percentage of visa overstayers than the national average. While most people crossing the border illegally come from a few countries including Mexico, undocumented immigrants who come from countries in South America, Asia or Europe are nearly all visa overstayers, he said. "What it comes down to is Florida has a higher mix of people who don’t come from Mexico or Central America than the country as a whole," he said. However, Warren said that the percentage of visa overstayers in Florida probably would be higher if you just looked at arrivals in the past 10 years. "To make estimates in this area of research you must make some assumptions based on the best information you have -- that is what I have done here," he said. We sent Warren’s estimate to other immigration experts, including Jeffrey Passel at the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan "fact tank" that doesn’t take policy positions, and Jessica Vaughan, who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. Both Passel and Vaughan said Warren’s estimates were reasonable, although Vaughan said his starting point numbers for the size of the undocumented population are too low. While Warren estimated the nationwide population at 10.9 million including 710,000 in Florida, Pew shows 11.1 million nationwide and 850,000 in Florida in 2014. "Warren’s calculations on the overstay rates are reasonable, although I sometimes disagree with some of his assumptions," Vaughan said. Our ruling Rubio said, "In Florida, 70 percent of the people here illegally came on an airplane. They overstayed a visa." Rubio’s spokespersons provided no evidence for his claim so we are uncertain of his source. The federal government does not appear to provide comprehensive data on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed their visa. However, a demographer who has studied the undocumented population for decades estimated that about 61 percent in Florida overstayed their visas.

pomt-11169	Says a young Texas rapper charged with capital crimes faces the death penalty but the alleged Santa Fe High School shooter faces prison and then parole after 40 years.	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/23/instagram-posts/false-meme-suggests-texas-rapper-faces-death-penal/	A U.S. Supreme Court ruling keeps the admitted shooter in a Santa Fe, Texas, school from facing the death penalty. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, would have had to be 18 to qualify. Still, a meme brought to our attention by readers suggests he's getting a special lift up. The meme shows an African-American 17-year-old Texas rapper, Taymore "Tay-K 47" McIntyre, and says that he faces the death penalty if convicted of capital charges pending against him. Meantime, the meme says, Pagourtzis--who admitted to the May 18, 2018, mass shooting at Santa Fe High School that killed 10 and wounded at least 10 others, according to court documents--faces no death penalty plus "parole in 40 years." Rapper T.I. recently shared the meme on his Instagram, saying, "So the question is how is the D.A. seeking the death penalty for Tay K & not the other guy?" T.I. went on to note that McIntyre is a minor, like Pagourtzis. They’re "the same age!!!!!!," T.I. wrote. According to a May 10, 2018, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story, McIntyre has been charged in two capital murders — one in Mansfield and one in San Antonio — as well as in an aggravated robbery that left an Arlington, Texas, man seriously injured. The story said he remained in jail. After the Santa Fe shootings, the Houston Chronicle, a Houston TV station and the Star-Telegram each declared that the disparity for capital crime convictions suggested by the meme lacks factual footing because of the 2005 Supreme Court ruling. To get our fix on the meme’s accuracy, we turned first to the court decision. Supreme Court acts On March 1, 2005, the court held by 5-4 that the Constitution’s bar on cruel and unusual punishment means the death penalty could no longer be imposed on juvenile offenders under 18. The Eighth Amendment provides: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." The ruling, in Roper vs. Simmons, stemmed in part, the majority wrote, from 30 states already prohibiting the juvenile death penalty. The ruling removed 72 people from death rows in a dozen states, according to a March 2005 news story in the New York Times, and "represented an about-face for a court that only 16 years ago rejected the argument that the execution of those who kill at the age of 16 or 17 violated" the constitutional bar on cruel and unusual punishments. By phone, Sarah Guidry, who directs the Earl Call Institute for Legal and Social Policy at Texas Southern University’s Thurgood Marshall School of Law, said that after the high court acted, Texas lawmakers amended state law. Section 8.07(c) of the state’s penal code states: "No person may, in any case, be punished by death for an offense committed while the person was younger than 18 years." Before the Supreme Court ruled, Texas was among 12 states with juveniles on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that compiles information and statistics about the death penalty. From 1976 until the court acted, the center says, 22 defendants were executed for crimes committed as juveniles. By phone, the center’s Robert Dunham told us 13 of the death penalties were carried out in Texas. Dunham, calling the meme false, said the Roper ruling left no room for states to sentence to death any individuals younger than 18 at the time of their crimes. By phone, Texas state senators versed in criminal justice told us the court’s ruling in Roper means no juvenile can be sentenced to death. Sen. Juan "Chuy" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ruling "changed the lay of the land when it came to the death penalty and juveniles." Parole in 40 years? Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, said state law otherwise backs up the meme’s indication that Pagourtzis could be imprisoned yet paroled after 40 years. That's so, she said, thanks to legislative action in the wake of a June 2012 Supreme Court ruling. The majority opinion in Miller v. Alabama states: "By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment." In 2013, Texas lawmakers reacted to the ruling by passing into law a measure mandating that all juveniles convicted of capital offenses be sentenced to prison for 40 calendar years before qualifying for consideration for parole. Previously, juveniles 17 to 18 convicted of capital offenses faced life-without-parole sentences. We asked Dunham to speak to the parole part of the meme. He cautioned that Texas law solely permits juveniles sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after 40 years; the law doesn’t say anyone automatically gets paroled. Summing up, Dunham said: "If you are age 17, the most you can get for capital murder in Texas is life with the possibility of parole after 40 years." Our ruling A meme suggests a Texas rapper charged with capital offenses faces the death penalty while the alleged shooter in the Santa Fe school faces prison only and then parole after 40 years -- even though both are 17. That disparity isn’t backed up by state laws which, in compliance with Supreme Court rulings, potentially subject both the rapper and the alleged school shooter to sentences of life in prison with parole possible after 40 years. U.S. juveniles haven’t been subject to death sentences since the high court ruled out that prospect in 2005. We rate this meme False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07311	President Barack Obama deserves to be called "the most successful food stamp president in American history" because "47 million Americans are on food stamps."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-defends-calling-barack-obama-food-st/	On the May 15, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich defended his earlier characterization of President Barack Obama as "the most successful food stamp president in American history." Host David Gregory first showed a clip of Gingrich’s earlier comment, made at a Georgia Republican Party dinner. "You want to be a country that creates food stamps, in which case frankly Obama's is an enormous success," Gingrich said in the recorded excerpt. "The most successful food stamp president in American history. Or do you want to be a country that creates paychecks?" Gregory then asked Gingrich if that comment included overtones of racism. Gingrich shot back, "Oh, come on, David!" Gregory responded, "What did you mean? What was the point?" Gingrich replied, "That's, that's bizarre. That -- this kind of automatic reference to racism, this is the president of the United States. The president of the United States has to be held accountable. Now, the idea that -- and what I said is factually true. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps. One out of every six Americans is on food stamps." We're not going to address the racial implications but decided to check Gingrich's main comment. We see two points to investigate. First, are Gingrich’s numbers accurate? And second, is it fair to blame Obama for today's high use of food stamps? First, the numbers. We’ll start by noting that "food stamps" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name. For the most recent month with available data -- February 2011 -- roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits. That’s a bit less than Gingrich had said, but it’s in the ballpark. That also wasn’t a fluke: February marked the third consecutive month that the number of recipients topped 44 million. In fact, based on our look through the historical data, February’s numbers appear to be the highest number of beneficiaries in any month since the program was established in 1969. As recently as October 2007, about 27 million Americans received SNAP benefits. That’s more than a 60 percent increase in beneficiaries in three and a half years. The 44 million accounts for about 14 percent of Americans -- slightly less than one out of every seven, rather than one out of six, as Gingrich said. Now the second question: Is it fair to lay the blame on Obama? Obviously, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the serious recession that began in December 2007 -- more than a year before Obama took office. It’s hard to determine how much blame Obama deserves compared to his predecessor, President George W. Bush, but the experts we spoke to, conservative and liberal, agree that Obama inherited a serious economic situation. Part of the reason it’s tricky to divvy up blame is that there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The monthly growth has slowed over the last three months, and if current trends continue, it could start declining in a month or two. It’s also impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010. However, the fact remains that SNAP usage has continued to climb every single month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama. The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency. Where does this leave us? Gingrich was close on the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits. In addition, the number of beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen every month of the Obama presidency. On the other hand, Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama should be considered "the most successful food stamp president in American history," because much -- though probably not all -- of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited and a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-05-16T17:07:19	2011-05-15	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06301	"One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/17/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-one-third-ohios-college-grads/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been giving a lot of speeches lately to a variety of groups but the message is typically the same: that, in his opinion, the state was on life-support when he took office in January and is slowly recovering thanks to his initiatives. To drive his point that Ohioans have become increasingly disenchanted with the Buckeye state, the Republican leader suggests that many college graduates are giving up hope of ever making a career here and instead are choosing to leave to pursue life elsewhere. "One-third of our college grads leave Ohio within three years," Kasich said at a highway engineers conference in Columbus on Oct. 25. "We lose our best and brightest." Losing 1 in every 3 Ohio college graduates would be a classic example of what academia has come to refer as the "brain drain." PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know whether the governor accurately captured the girth of the problem. To start, the statement seems to overlook the fact that not all college graduates are Ohioans to begin with. The Ohio State University, for example, is one of the largest universities in the country with more than 56,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. About 22 percent of them are not Ohio natives. It stands to reason that some would return to their home state or be recruited for work outside of Ohio. That point aside, we decided to look at Kasich’s point of reference. His information comes from the Ohio Board of Regents, which in 2008, under a previous administration, said that just 66 percent of Ohio public college grads were still in the state three years after graduation. Then-Chancellor Eric Fingerhut aimed to raise that figure to 70 percent by 2017. The Regents said that figure still holds today. Regents spokeswoman Kim Norris said 66 percent of Ohio’s Spring 2008 public college graduates were employed in Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2010. To put it in numerical terms, Ohio had 39,736 graduates — associate, Bachelor’s, graduate and professional degrees and certificates combined — in Spring 2008 and 26,082 of them were working in Ohio late last year. Norris said the Regents came up with the figure by cross-matching college graduates with employment data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services. But there is a catch. The Regents figures only count people who are employed. It assumes the other 33-percent left the state. That would support the governor’s statement, but isn’t it possible that many of those 14,000 people earning degrees in 2008 are still in Ohio and unemployed? Norris conceded that also could be the case. Ohio’s unemployment rate in September was 9.1 percent, matching the national rate. There were more than 530,000 Ohioans out of work and actively looking for a job, according to data from the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services. The Board of Regents did not have a figure of 2008 college grads who were still in Ohio three years later that includes those that might be unemployed. PolitiFact Ohio thinks it is safe to say that there are not just two options at play here for those college graduates: that either they found a job here or that they left Ohio. Unfortunately, given the state and nation’s economy, some are likely unemployed and looking to put their college degrees to work. If the 9.1 percent unemployment rate is applied to the 14,000 people who earned degrees but are not employed in Ohio, it accounts for 1,274 people. That would amount to slightly more than 3 percent of the people who got degrees in 2008. The governor is making a salient point, that as the economy limps along, bright, young minds might be encouraged to look for their opportunities elsewhere and that should worry anyone concerned for Ohio’s future. The Board of Regents figure does not account for the possibility some of those grads didn’t leave, but are unemployed. That’s information that provides clarification. And even if the unemployment rate is taken into consideration, the figure the governor used is still in the ballpark. And the message behind his statement, that Ohio is losing some of its youngest talent, is a accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10846	"During his tenure in Washington and in the Illinois State Senate, Barack Obama has accumulated a record of bipartisan success."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/09/barack-obama/his-record-on-bipartisanship-is-split/	Obama wants voters to believe that he's a bipartisan legislator in Washington. And while it's true that he has co-sponsored bills with GOP members, and Republicans may count him among their friends, Obama certainly is a loyal Democrat when it comes to voting on legislation. He attempted to work on campaign finance reform with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., but McCain, ended up accusing Obama of using the issue for his own political gain. He's had more success on energy and political reform issues, working with Republican Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Senate-watchers say Obama hasn't been around Washington long enough to gain much of a reputation as a legislator. Three years just isn't enough time to judge a Senate career, said Lewis Gould, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Texas and author of "The Most Exclusive Club: A History of the Modern United States Senate." Gould declined to discuss Obama directly, but said, "It's easy enough to cosponsor things. It's very hard to judge effectiveness." But if it is difficult to evaluate Obama's work as a senator, it is possible to examine his voting record. An analysis conducted by Congressional Quarterly and released last week showed that, for the votes so far in 2007, Obama voted with his party's position 96 percent of the time. For someone who may be trying to paint himself as bipartisan, that's pretty partisan.

pomt-02982	Common Core means "there are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/tim-curtis/anti-common-core-government-collecting-data-studen/	Tapping into concerns about privacy, some opponents of Common Core have portrayed the new educational standards as a tool by the government to spy on children and store data on them. And they aren’t talking about a few test scores here -- but a big ol’ heap of data on every student. "There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you," said Tim Curtis, an activist with the tea party group 9/12, at a meeting in Tampa about Common Core on Oct. 15. That sounds like a massive amount of data for the government to collect on every child and their families. We decided to engage in a little data mining of our own: what type and amount of information will the government collect on students and their families, and is because of Common Core? Data collection with or without Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Curtis told us that when he said the "government" will collect data he meant the school district as well as the state and federal education departments. "In order for Common Core to work its supposed magic, all of this information is going to have to be consolidated at the federal level," Curtis told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. "Only then will they be able to compare state-to-state across the board." Many Common Core opponents, including in Florida, point to the National Education Data Model to argue that Common Core will lead the government to collect hundreds of data elements on students. But that data model is just that -- a voluntary model that states can use for guidance about how to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said he never counted the data elements in the National Education Data Model but that 400 is probably accurate. Since 2011, the focus has been on a different model called Common Education Data Standards which has over 1,000 elements, Buckley said. (Florida does not even use the National Education Data Model and has its own version called PK20 data warehouse.) "For whatever reason a lot of Common Core opponents seized upon this as if it has anything to do with Common Core, which it doesn’t," he said. We contacted a few school districts in Florida, including Broward and Hillsborough counties, to ask about their plans for data collection. Officials told us no additional data would be collected because of Common Core. We also found multiple education experts who disagreed with Curtis’ claim, including from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Foundation. The bottom line: States have been collecting data on students -- and sharing it in aggregate with the U.S. Education Department -- long before Common Core. And that doesn’t change because of Common Core. School districts collect students’ names, the classes in which they are enrolled, their reading and math proficiency and whether they graduated on time, said Paige Kowalski, director of state policy and advocacy for the Data Quality Campaign, a national advocacy organization. States collect the data to help them make decisions -- for example about tests. The U.S. Education Department can only access aggregate data -- for example, what percentage of third-graders in Florida are proficient in reading -- not the test scores of a particular third-grader. That means school districts don’t send student names and other personal details to the federal government. In fact, laws predating Common Core prohibit a federal database of personally identifiable information on students. "Absolutely nothing has changed in terms of what the state is collecting from districts as a result of adopting Common Core standards and implementing them," Kowalski said. Here’s what is different under Common Core: If Florida and another state both adopt the same standards and assessments, then the tests will provide an apples-to-apples comparison between two states. For decades, Florida has required school districts to implement a system that contains student information. And today that list of data is long -- some of it is required by the state, while other elements are optional, or only kept at the local level such as bus stop number. That list of data includes students’ race, whether they are homeless, test scores, attendance and many more factors. However, "There is no increased data collection specifically linked to Common Core," said Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, a point repeated in the state’s fact sheet. "Florida has no plans to change the data it collects that is linked to Common Core." Iris scans and Common Core We told Curtis that educational experts said that Common Core doesn’t require new data collection. "I can shoot that claim down with a single explanation," Curtis said. "The Polk County school district began to do iris screening on school children and they did so without notifying their parents. They did so as a result of the beginning of the implementation of Common Core." According to the Florida Department of Education, the screening was intended to route children onto the proper bus. It didn’t have anything to do with Common Core. "Polk County was piloting a new school bus safety program for students that involved eye scanning, which had nothing to do with the new standards. Permission slips were mistakenly not sent out," the department said. Our ruling Tim Curtis, an activist against Common Core, said that thanks to Common Core, "There are over 300 data elements the government is going to be collecting about your children and about you." Common Core State Standards do not include new requirements for the government to collect data on school children. It’s true that school districts and the state of Florida already collect a long list of data on students. That data is aggregated for the federal government, after stripping out students’ personal information, and that data collection doesn’t change whether states adopt Common Core or not. Common Core opponents are mixing two separate issues here: the transition to Common Core and data collection that already occurs. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05758	Says when she "helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted No."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/01/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-claims-dennis-kucinich-voted-no-veter/	A 30-second TV ad for Marcy Kaptur aimed a three-point attack at Dennis Kucinich, the fellow incumbent she faces in the Democratic primary for Ohio's new 9th congressional district. Kucinich opened their recent City Club debate objecting that the ad misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors. PolitiFact Ohio previously looked at the ad’s claim that "when Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no." We rated that Half True. For this analysis, we'll look at the claim: "When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no." The ad cites as its source the roll call vote of Dec. 10, 2009, on HR 3288, the omnibus appropriations package called the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The $447 billion measure, one of eight for fiscal 2010, included spending bills for numerous departments and agencies including the departments of State, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education. It also included funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Congress faced a deadline of Dec. 18 to get the package signed into law to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed it 221 to 202. It had no support from House Republicans. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no. Kucinich's campaign told us the congressman explained his opposition to the measure at the time of the vote. He acknowledged support for many of its provisions -- including increased veterans' benefits -- but took exception to other major provisions: "billions of dollars in military aid, sanctions and funds for policies in the Middle East that undermine the administration's call for a commitment to diplomacy; $239 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan; destabilizing investment and trade sanctions; and restrictions on aid to Gaza and the West Bank." Objecting that the Kaptur ad tried to portray Kucinich as "anti-veteran," his campaign cited efforts to fund research to help find causes and treatments for veterans suffering from Gulf War Syndrome. Kaptur campaign spokesman Steve Fought acknowledged that the omnibus spending bill had "money in there for the military. But you can't really pick and choose. It was to keep the government funded, and he decided to vote no. "He wants to have it both ways. He's letting others carry the ball and do the heavy lifting. He keeps talking about Gulf War Syndrome, but he voted against his own provision. He was for the research before he was against it," Fought said. Fought was referring to a provision in HR 2055 that was approved in the House last year. Kucinich co-sponsored an effort to obtain money specifically for Gulf War illness research. A news release his office issued Dec. 16, 2011, said he and Rep. Michael Michaud, a Maine Democrat, had won $10 million for the Gulf War Veterans' Illness Research Program. The statement says: "The funding was included in HR 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Kucinich won the adoption of an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act in July to increase the amount of money for GWVIRP by over 25 percent over last year's level." But Kucinich voted against HR 2055 when the full measure came up for a vote of the House -- much as he had done with the omnibus measure for 2010. Kaptur voted yes. The campaign ad claimed that "when Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no." Kucinich did vote against a bill that contained money for veterans. We have noted before that legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation. And Kucinich's votes on military spending, reflecting his opposition, have been consistent. Kucinich takes credit for championing a program that he ultimately voted against. His work for the program gives a different impression than his vote. His positions help explain his votes, both on HR 2055 last December and on HR 3288, the prior spending measure cited in the ad. Those are important pieces of information needed to evaluate the claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Half True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2012-03-01T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['None']
pomt-08230	A recent report from the president's deficit commission was "completely empty" on controlling health care costs.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/16/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-obamas-deficit-co-chairs-had-no-/	The co-chairs of President Barack Obama's deficit commission released their ideas for getting control of the federal deficit last week. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is not a fan. "I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all," Krugman said on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "But it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while patting my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?" The key to reducing the deficit, Krugman said, is reducing the future growth of health care costs. "The way you have to do that is by deciding what you're going to be willing to pay for," Krugman said. "They completely wimped out on that. They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary. So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on earth is that doing in there?" Here, we'll fact-check Krugman's statement that the report was "completely empty" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. We'll check his statement about large tax cuts for the top bracket in a separate report. First, a bit of (recent) history on the commission: President Barack Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February, 2010, asking it to identify "policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run." Obama asked the commission to propose ideas designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. He appointed six members, including bipartisan co-chairs, and asked congressional leaders from both parties -- Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Republicans Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- to appoint three each, for a total of 18 members. The proposal released Nov. 10 was not the final report, which requires approval from 14 of 18 members and has a deadline of Dec. 1. Rather, the proposal summarized the ideas of the two co-chairs: Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. We're not sure why the two took the step of releasing their proposals ahead of the deadline; some news reports speculate it was an attempt to prod other members to keep negotiating before the December deadline. If the members are not able to come to an agreement, it's possible that no report will be issued. We previously reviewed the co-chairs' proposal for our factsheet on reducing the deficit, but now we wanted to look in detail at what it said about health spending. Krugman is right that the report released last week reads like "a bunch of ideas." It reminded us more of a PowerPoint presentation than a policy brief. But it does address Medicare spending and other improvements to the health care system on pages 31 to 36. (The full report is 50 pages; view it here.) Some of its suggestions for Medicare are vague, such as its solution for addressing future shortfalls for payments to doctors and hospitals. Right now, Congress funds payments every year in a move that's come to be known as the "doc fix." The co-chairs' proposal suggests paying for that "by asking doctors and other health providers, lawyers, and individuals to take responsibility for slowing health care cost growth." It then suggests, "Pay doctors and other providers less, improve efficiency, and reward quality by speeding up payment reforms and increasing drug rebates," as well as, "Pay lawyers less and reduce the cost of defensive medicine by adopting comprehensive tort reform." The report also suggests the government "expand cost-sharing in Medicare to promote informed consumer health choices and spending." That means asking seniors to pay more for their health care benefits. But the proposal also includes budget estimates for various health care-related cost savings in 2015 and for the years 2012 through 2020, on pages 33 and 35. More specifically, the report recommends strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, a new board created under the 2010 health care law. The board is intended to make evidence-based recommendations on reducing costs and improving the quality of care in Medicare. In practice, the board will likely issue rules on which procedures it will pay for and which it won't, and these rules will apply across the board. (The board will not get involved in decisions on individual patients based on their worth to society -- the old "death panels" lie.) The board's recommendations will take effect unless Congress overrules them. The co-chairs' proposal suggested several ways that the board could be strengthened, such as applying its recommendations to all health care providers without some of the exceptions allowed under the health care law. It suggested that the board make recommendations on benefit design and cost-sharing, which the health care law does not allow. Finally, the co-chairs suggested that the board's proposals apply not only to Medicare but also to private health insurance plans sold in government-sponsored exchanges. On This Week, Ruth Marcus, a Washington Post columnist, challenged Krugman's claim and specifically mentioned the IPAB. "They did talk about strengthening that commission, the famous IPAB, and giving it more power to go after more aspects of the health care system, because it's now rather constrained," Marcus said. "They made no headlines with that," Krugman responded. "And some friends of mine are calling this the commission to put caps on lots of stuff. It's a lot of numerical caps without any explanation of how they're going to happen." We e-mailed Krugman after the show to ask him about his comments. He said his reading of the report, particularly page 31, struck him as "a model of vagueness." But, he added, "I was somewhat unfair in not giving credit for the endorsement of the IPAB." In ruling on Krugman's statement, he said the deficit proposal was "completely empty" on reining in the future growth of health care costs. Krugman has a point that the co-chairs' proposal is vague. But the proposal does have several specific ideas on how to strengthen the IPAB. It has other recommendations on health care spending as well, and it includes dollar estimates for how much its ideas would reduce spending. It does recognize that health care spending must be controlled, and it's not completely empty of ideas. We rate Krugman's statement False.

pomt-13602	The Obama administration has been "raising taxes."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/16/mike-pence/mike-pence-half-right-obama-has-been-raising-taxes/	Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee, says Americans are paying higher taxes under President Barack Obama. "We’ve suffered through an administration that’s been raising taxes, raising regulations, growing government, borrowing and spending, and trying to bail our way back to a growing economy," Pence, the Indiana governor, said during an Aug. 4 rally in Norfolk. That’s a long list of charges, and we want to look at the first one - that the White House has been "raising taxes." Marc Lotter, Pence’s campaign spokesman, backed the governor’s statement by sending us a list of tax hikes enacted under Obama. The list, compiled by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, contains a levy that Obama imposed on tobacco products as well as a series of taxes that were raised to fund the president’s health care reforms. We also contacted Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He told us that for the most part, there haven’t been many major tax changes during Obama’s term. That said, he pointed out two changes to tax laws under Obama. The first, as we’ve mentioned, were levies to pay for health care reforms in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Among them is the individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance; a 10 percent tax on tanning services; and a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income for high earners. Williams also cited the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act, which extended most of a series of income tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. The Bush-era tax cuts had been set to expire in 2012. Obama signed a law that extended the cuts for all taxpayers except individuals making $400,000 a year or more and married filers earning $450,000 or more. Williams said only about 1 percent of taxpayers fit into those high-income categories. "It was a really small share of people that got hit with higher taxes," he told us. "It was really a tax cut for everybody else. … If Congress had done nothing, everybody’s taxes would have gone up." Has the average federal tax burden on households increased under Obama? For that answer, we turned to a report issued in June by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It computed an average rate by factoring in individual and corporate taxes as well as payroll levies and excise taxes. The CBO figures are available only through 2013, but you still can get an idea of the trajectory of tax rates through most of Obama’s tenure. They show that in 2009, when Obama took office, the average household federal tax rate was 17.3 percent and in 2013, the rate was 20.1 percent - a nearly 3 percentage point increase. But Williams noted that 2009 is a low point to begin the comparison, in part because Obama enacted a federal tax cut that year as part of a stimulus package to combat the Great Recession. The average tax burden was 18.1 percent in 2008, the last year of the Bush administration. But that’s also a questionable year to start a comparison, Williams said, because the rate was lowered artificially by temporary tax cuts Bush approved to jump-start the economy. So we went back to 2007, when the average federal tax rate was 19.9 percent, or just under where it was in 2013. If you go back to 2006, the overall tax rate was 20.4, or slightly above where it was in 2013. The CBO figures show that in 2013, the average rate paid by people in the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers was lower than it was for those in the same income level in 2006 or 2007. The average rate for those in the top 20 percent, however, rose during that time. The Tax Policy Center last month released its own tallies of the average federal tax rate. The center calculates its figures differently than the CBO. For example, the center counts estate taxes in its tax rate figures, while the budget office doesn’t. The CBO includes the value of Medicare and Medicaid benefits in its income computations, while the Tax Policy Center doesn’t. One drawback to the Tax Policy Center’s figures is that they go back only to 2011. That year, the average federal tax rate came to 16.8 percent. By 2016, the average federal tax rate was 19.8 percent. That’s a 3 percentage point jump, but there’s a couple of things to keep in mind: Some of the temporary tax measures meant to stimulate the economy expired during that time. Chief among them is a temporary drop in the payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent, an Obama-era measure that ended in 2012. Beyond policy decisions, changes in the economy also affect the average tax rate. The average tax rate has gone up as incomes have risen in the past five years and people have moved into higher tax brackets, Williams said. Our ruling Pence said that the Obama administration has been "raising taxes." Obama certainly raised some levies, including income taxes on people earning more than $400,000 a year. Although most folks don’t fall into that category, Obama’s health care reforms come with a series of new taxes that do affect lower earners. But Pence’s statement leaves a lot out of the story. Obama also has extended permanently tax cuts that were set to expire. He also enacted a series of temporary tax cuts aimed at jump-starting the economy. Figures from the CBO and the Tax Policy Center show that average tax rates have risen under Obama, but part of the reason is that Obama also allowed some special tax cuts enacted during the recession to expire. If you go back to CBO figures before the recession and compare them with figures after it ended, the average household tax rate was about the same in 2006 as it was in 2013. So on balance, we rate Pence’s claim Half True.	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-08-16T12:22:06	2016-08-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02295	David Alameel "is giving thousands of dollars to support the Republican Party candidates" including John Cornyn and Greg Abbott.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/03/kesha-rogers/david-alameel-has-been-5-million-bipartisan-donor-/	Kesha Rogers of Houston described her foe in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the state's Democratic U.S. Senate nomination as a current donor to Republicans including that party’s nominee, second-term Sen. John Cornyn. Rogers, a LaRouche Democrat making her first bid for statewide office, made her comment about Dallas investor David Alameel in our March 27 interview with her during our check of a claim that she’s not a Democrat. Rogers is a Democrat, we concluded, though she espouses views out of step with mainstream Democrats such as a desire to impeach President Barack Obama. In that interview, we asked if Rogers had more to share on her Democratic bonafides. "We should look at the fact that my opponent… Mr. Alameel... is giving thousands of dollars to support the... Republican Party candidates such as... John Cornyn and John Abbott himself," Rogers replied, shortly agreeing that she meant Greg Abbott, the state attorney general and 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee. Alameel’s donations to numerous candidates over the years have been noted. But has he backed Republicans of late? News coverage In a news story posted online Dec. 2, 2013, the Dallas Morning News said Alameel and his wife donated $8,000 to Cornyn’s campaign and $7,500 to Cornyn’s political action committee in 2004 and 2005. The story also said Alameel gave Abbott $165,000 from 2002 to 2008 while Alameel gave $30,000 in 2012 to state Sen. Wendy Davis, the Fort Worth Democrat then on her way to becoming the Democrats’ 2014 choice for governor. Broadly, the story said, Alameel had pitched in for candidates from both major parties. "He’s given $700,000 in the last six years to Democrats at the federal level," the newspaper said, while donating $250,000 to Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst from 2002 to 2008 and earlier giving $75,000 to Rick Perry’s campaign in 1998, when Perry, now governor, was bidding for lieutenant governor. "I’m not your typical Democrat," Alameel was quoted as saying. "I’m conservative in many ways and have worked with both parties." About a month later, the weekly Austin Chronicle said in a news story that another Democratic Senate candidate, Maxey Scherr of El Paso, had described Alameel as a DINO--Democrat In Name Only. According to the Chronicle, Scherr singled out past Alameel donations to Dewhurst as well as $4,200 given to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and $8,400 donated to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. The story further noted the donations to Cornyn and said Alameel gave $50,000 in 2005-06 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Then again, the story said, Alameel stopped giving to Republicans after the 2008 elections. "Since then, Alameel's donations have been strictly Demo­cratic and progressive," the story said. "His campaign notes that he is the nation's 15th biggest Democratic donor. That includes $100,000 to the progressive Lone Star Pro­ject PAC, and almost $2 million to his North Texas Leader­ship PAC." Federal Election Commission breakdown We asked the Federal Election Commission to itemize Alameel’s donations to candidates and political committees. By email, spokesman Christian Hilland sent charts showing Alameel and his wife ponied up about $1 million to nearly 60 recipients from 1989 into May 2013, counting his largest contribution of $500,000, in 2012, to Majority PAC, a super PAC created by a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with a focus on protecting the Democrats’ Senate majority. That year, Alameel sought a Dallas-Fort Worth U.S. House seat, losing the Democratic primary to a Fort Worth state representative, Marc Veasey. Cornyn fielded $8,000 from Alameel in November 2004, according to the chart. In a Jan. 30, 2014, news blog post, the Morning News noted that Alameel had recently said he wanted that money back with Cornyn shooting back that a refund wasn’t going to happen. Outside of the six-figure donation to Majority PAC, Alameel’s federal donations went more to Republicans than Democrats: He and his wife donated nearly $270,000 to about 17 Republican candidates or committees and about $180,000 to about 15 Democratic beneficiaries. See the main chart provided by Hilland here and one covering other Alameel donations here. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican seeking federal office amounted to $28,500 supportive of Sen. John McCain, dated April 23, 2008, according to the FEC information, while after that, Alameel donated nearly $660,000 to Democratic candidates and committees. Texas Ethics Commission records To get a fix on how much Alameel has given to candidates for state office, we searched state campaign finance reports stockpiled on the Texas Ethics Commission website. From February 2000 into January 2014, this search indicated, Alameel donated about $4 million to such candidates and committees including Democrats, Republicans and Carole Keeton, then Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who declared herself an Independent before running for governor in 2006. Alameel’s biggest state beneficiary was his since-disbanded PAC, which drew in some $2.8 million, according to the search. Per Rogers’ claim: Alameel made five donations to Abbott, adding up to $165,000, from December 2002 through June 2007, the search shows, though Alameel earlier in 2002 gave $30,000 to Democrat Kirk Watson when Watson faced Abbott for attorney general. Alameel’s latest donation to a Republican aspirant for state office was $10,000, given March 3, 2008, to Texans for Cole, the committee for Jonathan Cole, a Collin County candidate, our search showed. More recently, Alameel and Alameel Family Partners, Ltd., gave $307,500 from January 2013 through January 2014 to Democratic interests. This included $250,000 that went to the state kitty of the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group managed by Matt Angle out of the Washington, D.C. area, and $50,000 given to the Democratic caucus in the Texas House, according to the search. A Rogers’ campaign adviser, Harley Schlanger, said by email that Rogers obviously meant Alameel had donated funds to Republicans in the past. "If she said in her discussion with you he ‘is giving,’ she misspoke," Schlanger said. He said earlier: "Her point is that the people attacking her for her opposition to Obama are embracing a candidate who has a clear and defined past relationship with the Republican Party." We were unable to reach Alameel or anyone with Alameel’s campaign. Our ruling Rogers said Alameel "is giving thousands of dollars to support the Republican Party candidates" such as Cornyn and Abbott. Alameel donated some $5 million to political committees including individual Republicans and Democratic candidates from 1989 on, and his donations included aid to campaigns for Cornyn and Abbott. However, records do not show any donations to Republicans after 2008. Whether Rogers misspoke or not, what she said is incorrect, though we see an element of truth due to Alameel’s historically bipartisan giving, making this interview claim Mostly False.

pomt-04999	Says it's not "accidental" that the villain in the Batman movie is named Bane.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/18/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-claims-link-between-batmans-bane-and/	What’s behind the mask of the snarling, hulking, steroid-crazed villain who wants to take down Batman and rule Gotham City? A plot to swing the presidential election! This week on his popular radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh casually tossed out the theory that it’s no accident that the evil genius in The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, bears the same name as the much-maligned private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney. Bane is the very, very bad guy out to kill Batman. Bain Capital is Romney’s former company, which has been the target of accusations that it outsourced jobs, closed factories and reaped huge profits for itself. "Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire-breathing, four-eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?" Limbaugh suggested to his listeners. You can see our serious fact checks about Bain Capital here. For now, we thought we’d take a pop-culture diversion from politics to the comic book underworld to see if Limbaugh has really uncovered an evil plot. What he said From the transcript of Limbaugh’s July 17, 2012, show: "This evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there's now a discussion out there as to whether or not this is purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It's gonna have a lot of people. This movie, the audience is gonna be huge. A lot of people are gonna see the movie, and it's a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they're gonna hear Bane in the movie and they're gonna associate Bain. The thought is that when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama and the Democrats keep talking about Bain, Romney and Bain, that these people will think back to the Batman movie, ‘Oh, yeah, I know who that is.’ There are some people who think it'll work. Others think you're really underestimating the American people to think that will work." He wrapped up: "You may think it's ridiculous, I'm just telling you this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up. The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning to. These are the kind of people that they are attempting to appeal to." A short history of Bane So listen up, brain-dead people. To learn more about this villain, we consulted scholarly sources such as The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, and io9, a site that covers science, science fiction and the future. Bane, the encyclopedia tells us, was born in the fictional South American country of Santa Prisca and grew up in prison, forced to serve a sentence for the crimes of his father. He grows into a violent genius, who commits murder at age 8 and acquires superhuman strength after surviving experiments with a drug called Venom, which left him impossibly virile but forever reliant on the drug. The tentacled mask he wears connects to pumps that deliver regular doses. He eventually breaks out of prison, bound for Gotham City, where he plans to overpower Batman and assume power. A compelling personal history, to be sure. But the bottom line is this: Bane entered the Batman storyline in 1993. That’s more than a decade before Romney first ran for president in 2007. Think Bane creator Chuck Dixon had that much foresight? He doesn’t. "Ridiculous," is what Dixon called suggestions of a connection between his character and Romney’s company. Dixon responded on his message board to the notion, first raised by a Democrat, that the two story lines are linked. "I saw it on FB like two hours ago," Dixon wrote. "Ridiculous. Tho' I got a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rush may pick up on this. And (that) would be the second time he pegged me and (co-creator) Graham (Nolan) as liberals on his show." Limbaugh hadn’t yet weighed in, but Dixon showed his crafty knack for foreshadowing. He’s no liberal -- he identifies as a conservative. Not that he minds the publicity. "Overgrasping Dems? Hey, if it gets Obama supporters into theaters. Maybe they'll buy thousands of Bane toys to throw at Romney. It all adds to MY Bane capital. I wonder if the Romney campaign will contact me?" Dixon wrote. We’ve also read several commentaries that find a more obvious parallel between the wealthy Romney and the Bruce Wayne character, a proverbial 1-percenter. In one trailer, Catwoman echoes the Occupy Wall Street movement, telling Wayne, "There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us." Dixon too saw more parallels between Batman and Romney, telling a call-in radio show, "Bane is a force for evil and the destruction of the status quo. He's far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street-type if you're looking to cast him politically. And if there ever was a Bruce Wayne running for the White House it would have to be Romney." Our ruling Limbaugh suggested it’s no accident that in a movie coming out four months before the presidential election, the villain bears the same name as the company formerly run by Romney and now being attacked by Democrats. In politics, conspiracies are everywhere if you look hard enough. But Limbaugh’s superpowers of persuasion can’t make this theory stand up. The villainous Bane first appeared in Batman comic books in 1993, long before Romney entered presidential politics. Even the character’s creator called a suggested link "ridiculous."

pomt-09467	Says she’s "tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts."	false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/03/mindy-montford/judicial-candidate-mindy-montford-says-mailer-shes/	Austin lawyer Mindy Montford, seeking the Democratic nomination for a state district judgeship, says she’s got vast courthouse experience, much of that from eight-plus years as a Travis County assistant district attorney, which followed her job as a Harris County prosecutor. Montford, running for judge of the 299th state district court, says on her campaign Web site that she’s had over 100 trials and handled thousands of cases, a claim that seems possible considering she worked nearly a decade as a prosecutor. We were exploring those claims when we came across a more dramatic Montford mailer that reached voters in mid-February. It states that Montford "has tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts." Talk about close-to-home experience. We shifted gears to check her Travis County claim. Montford earlier had told us she reached her total for Travis County jury trials by estimating trials she had worked on while in the Travis County DA's office, from October 1999 through the end of her tenure there in May 2008. Montford said she averaged 10 jury trials a year. "Some years there were fewer than 10 and some years there were more than 10," she said. Using Montford's claimed average, that adds up to 87 jury trials over eight years and eight months. Montford said she also had one jury trial as a lawyer in private practice, in 2009. That brings us to 88 Travis County jury trials, short of her mailer's claim to over 100 jury trials. After we asked her about the mailer, Montford admitted it was in error. "You are correct that some of our campaign literature mistakenly says that I have tried over 100 jury trials in Travis County," she said. "That was an oversight and one that was never meant to mislead anyone. In every speech I have made on the trail, I have never claimed that all my jury trials were in Travis County and our Web site correctly states the information." On her campaign site and on other mailers, Montford's claim to over 100 jury trials does not say they were all in Travis County. UPDATE: After our initial post of this item Feb. 27, PolitiFact Texas came across a door hanger distributed by Montford's campaign including the statement that she'd tried over 100 cases in Travis County courts. Her consultant, Mark Littlefield, then said that 1,000 of the door hangers were printed and distributed though he said volunteers spent time marking out the Travis County trials' claim on the hangers--a cross-out that didn't appear on the hanger we fielded. Littlefield said there are no other campaign items with Montford's trials-in-Travis County claim. Seeking an independent count of Montford's Travis County trials, we contacted the Travis County DA’s office. Spokesman Rudy Magallanes said Montford was the first- or second-chair prosecutor in 61 trials. She topped out at 14 trials in 2000. She had her low of two trials in 2006. Counting the single jury trial that Montford reports having as a lawyer in private practice, her confirmed jury trials in Travis County would number 62. There’s a small wrinkle, though. Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who bested Montford in a 2008 runoff for the Democratic nomination for district attorney, vouched for the 61 Montford jury trials reflected in a list kept by the executive assistant to the first assistant district attorney. But Lehmberg said the list might be incomplete. "There could have been more (Montford) trials that we did not write down," she said. We also checked with Harris County and compiled a list of 36 trials that had Montford as a prosecutor there. Like Lehmberg, Scott Durfee, an assistant general counsel for the Harris County District Attorney’s office, cautioned that the tabulation of trials by each attorney might be incomplete. So how does Montford’s statement of "over 100 jury trials" in Travis County stand up? As she admitted, not well; it was an erroneous mailing. Using Montford's own annual estimate, we reached a total of 88 Travis County jury trials. The DA's list is even shorter, prompting us to presume just 62 Montford jury trials in the county. In both counts, we take Montford at her word that she handled a single jury trial as a private lawyer. Even if the DA's office failed to count a few Montford trials, it wouldn't be enough to make her statement accurate, though Montford's trials confirmed by Travis and Harris counties plus the one she says she had in private practice add up to 98, which is close to 100. Montford owned up; we agree her mailer was wrong. We rate her statement as False.	None	Mindy Montford	None	None	None	2010-03-03T12:29:15	2010-02-22	['Travis_County,_Texas']
pomt-11590	Says Paul Soglin took Madison backward -- "businesses have left and murders have gone up."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/31/scott-walker/scott-walkers-overstated-attack-governor-rival-pau/	Republican Scott Walker, aiming to smack down the latest Democrat seeking to deny him a third term as governor, got off to an early start in attacking Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. At 6:41 a.m. on Jan. 10, 2018, the day Soglin announced his candidacy, Walker tweeted: The last thing we need is more Madison in our lives. @Paulsoglin is the latest extreme liberal who wants to take our state backward -- just like he did in Madison, where businesses have left and murders have gone up. We want to go forward. The capital city is generally known for having economic vitality and relative safety. So, let’s check the attack: Walker is claiming that in Madison, businesses have left and murders have gone up, and that Soglin is at least partly to blame. (We’ll note: The Wisconsin Republican Party unveiled an anti-Soglin website the same day and made an attack on Soglin similar to Walker’s.) Businesses leaving To back the first part of Walker’s statement, his campaign cited to us two large employers that left the city: 1. Spectrum Brands, the owner of Rayovac, Remington and other consumer product lines, announced in 2012 it was moving its headquarters and more than 500 employees from Madison to Middleton, a suburb. Soglin complained that Spectrum Brands didn’t give Madison a chance to bid on keeping the company in the city. The company said its Madison facility was outdated and not energy efficient, and that it did consider sites in Madison. The company also said the cost savings -- along with a $4 million award from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a state agency under Walker -- "were substantial enough to shelve plans to move" to Florida. 2. Heinz Kraft, the parent company of Oscar Mayer, announced in 2015 it would shut down its 1,000-employee Oscar Mayer plant in Madison. Kraft Heinz said the decision was part of a plan to close seven factories in the United States and Canada, following its merger with Oscar Mayer. State Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Republican, pointed a finger of blame at Soglin, while Soglin criticized the Economic Development Corp. for not trying to keep the plant in Madison after learning that other states were trying to get the Wisconsin facilities. Walker’s campaign also pointed to criticism of Soglin over Oscar Mayer by former Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. But Cieslewicz concluded that the company’s decision to close the plant "almost certainly couldn’t have been headed off by state or local efforts, even if officials knew it was coming. This appears to be a straightforward business decision that had to do with changes in the industry and the configuration of the aging plant here." So, based on news reports of the companies’ own statements, it’s not clear how much of a role, if any, Soglin played in the companies’ decisions. Moreover, Walker didn’t provide any evidence that the two cases are anything more than isolated examples. We thought it was important to look at the number of businesses in Madison overall. Finding those numbers isn’t as simple as it might appear. These entities don’t count businesses at the City of Madison level: the state departments of Workforce Development and Financial Institutions; the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce; and three federal bodies -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The best count we could find is from the City of Madison assessor’s office, which tracks business that are subject to what is known as the personal property tax, but is only paid by businesses, based on their equipment and furnishings. (Utilities and manufacturers are excluded from the counts.) Business in Madison, per city assessor counts 2011 (Soglin takes office in April) 4,700 2012 5,095 2013 4,791 2014 4,949 2015 4,701 2016 4,704 2017 4,847 So, the figures indicate the number of businesses has gone up and down during Soglin’s tenure, but there are more now than when he took office. In other words, it isn’t a picture of a net loss in businesses. Murders in Madison Homicide in Madison is uncommon enough that, to the best of the Madison Police Department’s knowledge, the number has been in the single-digits in every year but one. So, even one or two incidents could cause an increase in a given year. In contrast, although Milwaukee’s population is only about 2.4 times larger than Madison’s (595,000 to roughly 252,000), it had more than 11 times as many homicides (124) in 2017. Here’s a look at the numbers: Homicides in Madison Year Number of homicides 2011 (Soglin took office in April) 7 2012 3 2013 5 2014 5 2015 6 2016 8 2017 11 So, the number of murders in 2016 and 2017 was higher than in every other year during Soglin’s tenure. In fact, the 11 in 2017 is a record for the city. Like many mayors, Soglin has sometimes clashed with his police chief over police staffing. And policing certainly is one factor in homicides. But criminologists say many other factors are involved. Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy James Alan Fox told us Soglin can’t be singled out for blame, saying: As is common for jurisdictions that tend to have fewer than a dozen homicides a year, there is a substantial volatility in the homicide counts that have little to do with any policy or practice. Such factors as whether a gunshot victim is struck in a vital organ or not, and how quickly an assault victim is brought to the hospital for emergency treatment, can impact whether a crime is a homicide or an aggravated assault. (Police policies and staffing could affect homicides), however, staffing levels have little impact on many forms of homicide. And whatever impact there is, it is hard to connect that with an increase of a few homicides. Said Rick Rosenfeld, a criminology and criminal justice professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis: These numbers are simply too low to draw meaningful conclusions about an increase, not to mention assigning "blame." Homicide counts will vary one year to the next simply because a bullet hits or misses a vital organ. Social scientists refer to such variation as measurement error. The Madison numbers are well within expected measurement error of this sort. Our rating Walker says Soglin took Madison backward -- "businesses have left and murders have gone up." There are, of course, examples of businesses having left Madison, but the total number of businesses appears to be higher now than when Soglin took office. As for murders, they increased by two in 2016 and by three in 2017, hitting a record high of 11. But the two large companies cited by Walker that pulled out of Madison cited business reasons, not Soglin, for leaving. And while a mayor can play some role in combating homicides, primarily through a police department, there are many factors that lead to murder. Walker’s statement contains an element of truth but is overbroad. We rate it Mostly False. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-01-31T06:00:00	2018-01-11	['None']
pomt-03934	Says, "when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar - I call it mismanagement – deficit."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/21/jon-bramnick/jon-bramnick-says-chris-christie-had-11-billion-de/	It’s the number that keeps on giving. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick is the latest public official to get mileage from a claim about an $11 billion albatross that was hanging around Chris Christie’s neck when he became governor in 2010. Bramnick, a Republican representing parts of Union, Somerset and Morris counties, mentioned the number during a roundtable discussion Feb. 8 for NJTV’s "On The Record" with Michael Aron. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked the existence of such a deficit on several occasions when Christie made similar claims. Why did Bramnick bring up the number? Bramnick and several other legislators were discussing the concept of the state returning money to municipalities that utilities pay towns for hosting utility poles, facilities and more. That money is paid to the state, which is supposed to then send the money – estimated in the hundreds of millions -- to the municipalities. That hasn’t happened, however, as the state grapples with various economic issues. Bramnick said the theory of returning the money is an idea no one would disagree with, but he questioned where the millions would come from. "When this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar -- I call it mismanagement – deficit," Bramnick said, adding that Christie has been working to improve the state’s finances. Bramnick’s right that Christie took office with an $11 billion deficit, but that number is a theoretical figure only. Let’s explain the deficit. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. That budget was put together under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. Christie’s first budget was for fiscal year 2012. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded. The state, however, does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute. That means that while a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. And like his predecessor, that’s basically what Christie did when it was his turn to craft a spending plan. In Christie’s case, he skipped a $3 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school-aid formula or the state’s property tax rebate program. The result? New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit for the fiscal 2012 budget year, but slightly smaller. It was $10.5 billion, according to the OLS. So there was an approximate $11 billion deficit when Christie took office, but in theory only. Bramnick acknowledged that the deficit in place when Christie took office was a structural deficit, and said he cited it during the discussion to illustrate the state’s financial woes. Our ruling Bramnick said during a roundtable discussion on NJTV’s "On The Record" with Michael Aron" that "when this governor came to office, he had (an) 11 billion dollar -- I call it mismanagement -- deficit." The OLS projected a nearly $11 billion structural deficit for the fiscal year 2011 budget created under Corzine, but it’s the type of deficit that measures how much money the state would need to maintain funding for services, if all required spending was fully funded and revenues stayed the same. Bramnick’s right that a deficit existed when Christie came into office, but it was a theoretical one that resulted because administrations prior to Christie’s didn’t spend all of the money needed to fully fund required expenses -- a move Christie repeated for his first budget as governor. We rate Bramnick's claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Jon Bramnick	None	None	None	2013-02-21T07:30:00	2013-02-08	['None']
pomt-12284	"We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/30/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-offers-credible-projection-federal-deb/	Could the United States be facing a future with $129 trillion in additional deficits over the next 30 years? Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., contends it’s possible. On June 26, 2017, as a Senate bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was foundering, Johnson wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, "Where the Senate health care bill fails." The op-ed focused on the difficulty of reining in federal outlays for health care spending. "We are $20 trillion in debt," Johnson wrote. "The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years. A truly moral and compassionate society does not impoverish future generations to bestow benefits in the here and now." Let’s take a closer look at those figures. Diving into the numbers The U.S. Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator allows you to track the federal debt on a daily basis. The website lists two kinds of debt -- publicly held debt and gross federal debt. The difference is that federal debt is calculated by taking the amount of publicly held debt and adding to it the debt that is held by the government. These are typically IOUs between one governmental entity and another, such as the money owed by the general treasury to the Social Security trust fund. As of June 29, the gross federal debt -- the more all-encompassing of the two figures -- was $19.8 trillion. That rounds up to $20 trillion, the figure Johnson cited. The other debt figure -- publicly held debt -- is smaller, at $14.3 trillion. However, since Johnson was very close to one of the two official figures, we won’t quibble. It’s trickier, though, to check whether the Congressional Budget Office -- a nonpartisan arm of Congress whose analyses are given significant weight in Washington policy debates -- projected an additional $129 trillion of "accumulated deficits." CBO does indeed calculate a figure for accumulated future deficits. CBO’s most recent Long Term Budget Outlook, released in March 2017, mainly discusses deficits and debt between now and 2047 as a percentage of gross domestic product. But we were able to check Johnson’s statement by reverse-engineering the dollar amounts using the percentages in the report. CBO projects $91.5 trillion in public debt by 2047, up from $14.8 trillion in 2017. That’s an increase of $77 trillion over 30 years. But remember that this is the figure for the public debt, the smaller of the two debt measurements, so we used that to estimate the size of the gross federal debt. Today, gross debt is 1.39 times larger than public debt. If that ratio holds steady over the next 30 years -- a big assumption -- then the gross federal debt in 2047 would be about $107 trillion. That still falls a bit short of Johnson’s $129 trillion. Why the gap? The answer: Johnson was applying a no-longer-used CBO formula to make his own calculations Since 2013, Johnson, a trained accountant, has regularly sought to spread the word about the United States’ long-term debt challenges. He put together a series of charts and graphs that he shared with fellow lawmakers and members of the media, focusing on the 30-year time frame, a long-term view that Johnson felt was too often missing from the conversation. To put these charts together, Johnson used a calculation made by the CBO called the "alternative fiscal scenario." The main CBO projections usually use current law as the starting point and assume that current law will continue indefinitely. However, to offer a wider range of future possibilities, CBO sometimes offers an "alternative" scenario using different assumptions about what the law would look like in the future. Because this alternative scenario tends to project higher future deficits, it explains why Johnson’s figure of $129 trillion is bigger than the official CBO projection of $107 trillion. CBO produced the alternative fiscal scenario itself, so it comes with significant credibility. However, it’s worth pointing out a caveat: The CBO hasn’t produced calculations based on its alternative fiscal scenario since its 2015 report, when Congress made moot a major reason the calculation was devised in the first place. (That year, Congress stopped putting off a planned cut in Medicare reimbursement for doctors and incorporated the higher rates into permanent law.) Johnson’s office said it ran the calculations by CBO while they were being developed. Still, the way Johnson framed the numbers in the op-ed is not strictly accurate. Johnson in his op-ed adapted a past calculation by CBO to make his claim. He wasn’t reporting what CBO produced. This framing matters, because it effectively turns a calculation by a partisan senator into one by an independent analyst. Our ruling Johnson wrote, "We are $20 trillion in debt. The Congressional Budget Office projects an additional $129 trillion of accumulated deficits over the next 30 years." Johnson’s figures are plausible. Even the official CBO figure of $107 trillion in 30 years -- while smaller than Johnson's $129 trillion -- is a huge number. But the attribution is sloppy. While the figure is based on CBO data, it is not an actual, current projection by CBO. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00216	"The latest round of tariffs now means that the total tax increase on Americans from enacted tariffs exceeds the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/12/national-taxpayers-union/trump-tariffs-cost-more-health-care-taxes/	In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, analysts at the National Taxpayers Union wrote that President Donald Trump’s tariffs would cost American taxpayers more than the Affordable Care Act. The pro-free trade group estimated the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs at $41.65 billion. (The research was conducted by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the National Taxpayers Union advocacy group.) "That easily outpaces the tax bill from the Affordable Care Act for next year ($34.6 billion) after accounting for recent changes to the ACA," they wrote. Are the tariffs costing Americans more than the health care law, or ACA? They are focused on the new taxes that were specifically created in the Affordable Care Act. But Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us there are hundreds of billions of dollars of general tax revenues that pay for Obamacare. So while the National Taxpayers Union is mainly correct in terms of the new taxes, it doesn’t quite capture all of the tax money that funds health care. The group used Congressional Budget Office July 2017 estimates of what repealing taxes connected with the health care law would cost in lost revenue. That was $49.2 billion. The repeal was unsuccessful, so taxpayers would have continued paying that sum. But two of those taxes were suspended for 2019: the tax on medical devices and insurers. That led to a reduction of $14.6 billion, landing the estimate of 2019 ACA taxes at $34.6 billion. However, the National Taxpayers Union’s estimate excludes the unpopular individual mandate, which imposed a penalty on people without insurance, as well as the employer mandate. The individual mandate is not being enforced, so that exclusion makes no difference. However, employer mandate penalties would add as much as $8 billion to the total in 2019, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would bring the total of ACA-imposed taxes somewhere around $42 billion, which exceeds the estimated cost of the tariffs. Trump tariffs The National Taxpayers Union’s rhetorical point is that tariffs are simply taxes on imports; businesses in the United States pay taxes on the imported goods, not China. For the tariffs, the National Taxpayers Union multiplied the percentage of each tariff by the amount of those goods imported last year. So the cost of a 25 percent steel tariff, for example, was $7.3 billion because in 2017, the U.S. imported just over $29 billion of steel. The American Tax Foundation used the same method and came to a similar estimate, $41.9 billion. That methodology assumes the same amount of goods will be imported as last year. But that’s by no means set in stone. "The dollar cost of the tariffs will be higher than we estimated if imports increase," said Bryan Riley, director of NTU's Free Trade Initiative and op-ed co-author. "However it's also possible that high tariffs could reduce import volume, which could offset some of the projected tariff revenue increase." Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, added that regardless of imports volume, we don’t know how they will get passed through by the companies paying them, either. And not everyone has to pay them -- consumers could simply redirect their demand. "Will it all get passed through in the form of higher prices on retail goods? Will the employees of these companies get lower wages? Likely some combination of these things, but nobody yet knows," Gardner said. Our ruling The National Taxpayers Union said, "The latest round of tariffs now means that the total tax increase on Americans from enacted tariffs exceeds the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act." Their estimates were that the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs would be $41.65 billion in 2019, while taxes for the health care law would be $34.6 billion. Both of these are estimates. Estimates of tariff costs fall slightly below new taxes introduced by the ACA when you factor in mandate penalties. However, the costs of tariffs are yet unknown, and its effects indirect on American taxpayers. We rate this statement Half True. Update: This report was updated to specifically mention the role of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.

pomt-06347	"We spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-taxpayers-spend-half-trillion-doll/	During the now-famous New Hampshire address by Rick Perry on Oct. 28, 2011 -- in which Perry’s animated banter went viral and drew satirical jabs from Saturday Night Live -- the Texas governor made a claim about how much Americans spend on preparing their taxes. "Everybody's got a slogan, right?" Perry said. "Mine's cut, balance and grow. Get that? Yes. Cut the size of this government and balance that budget and grow the economy, and it's pretty simple actually. Or you can stay in the old system that's out there. And then … the ones that want to stay in the old system, pay the lawyers, pay the accountants, all the money that's gone, or that. Think about it. You know, we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars." A reader asked us to check whether it’s true that "we spend half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation." (It’s a popular topic across the ideological spectrum; President Barack Obama's administration has proposed simplified tax filing procedures, though the effort is rated Stalled on our Obameter.) We called the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to see if it tracked that figure, and it said it didn’t. We also looked at federal gross domestic product statistics and found that the industry breakdown does not specify tax preparation among its categories of professional services, making an estimate impossible. However, the Perry campaign provided us with a source: A 2005 paper by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues. The paper noted at least three burdens caused by the tax code: tax planning -- or efforts to limit one’s taxes; defending against tax audits and tax litigation; and tax compliance, which includes record-keeping, education about tax laws, form preparation and packaging and sending tax forms. The foundation decided to look only at the third category -- tax compliance -- for calendar year 2005. Its researchers concluded that the costs of compliance for individuals was 2.8 billion hours, or $110 billion; the cost for businesses was 3.1 billion hours or $148 billion; and the cost for nonprofits was 141 million hours or $6.8 billion. In all, that works out to upwards of 6 billion hours and $265 billion. If that were the final number, Perry’s estimate would be significantly off base. But there are a few additional points we need to make. First, the same paper projected that compliance costs would rise to $483 billion by 2015, or $406 billion adjusted for the 2005 value of the dollar. The $483 billion number is closer to Perry’s estimate -- and in fact, his staff said that that’s the number he was referring to during the New Hampshire speech. However, that figure is an exaggeration of today’s cost. Using the same study’s projections, the amount for 2011 should be $392 billion, or $354 billion in 2005 dollars -- well below Perry’s $500 billion figure. At the pace projected by the paper, it would take until 2016 (using regular dollars) or 2022 (using inflation-adjusted dollars) to reach Perry’s amount of $500 billion. That’s either five years or 11 years into the future -- assuming the estimate was correct in the first place and assuming nothing fundamental has changed the long-term arc since 2005. There’s another concern. Perry said that we spend "half a trillion dollars a year in tax preparation. Any accountants or tax lawyers out there -- I'm sorry, dude, but that's too much money, a half a trillion dollars." This suggests that the costs we’re talking about are specifically those paid to accountants and lawyers. However, the amount calculated in the Tax Foundation study is broader. It includes time spent on internal bookkeeping and education about tax laws as well as money spent on postage and the like. In the Tax Foundation data, the costs strictly for "form preparation" -- the primary job of an accountant -- add up to 31 percent of individual tax compliance costs, 32 percent for businesses, 22 percent for nonprofits and 28 percent overall. Even if that percentage undercounts what taxpayers pay accountants, this would make Perry’s estimate even further off base. However, the decrease would be at least partially offset by adding in the cost of "tax lawyers," in Perry’s words, whose costs are not included in the Tax Foundation study. All this makes clear that estimating the tax compliance burden on the United States is tricky business. Indeed, the Government Accountability Office came to that very conclusion in a 2005 report. "Estimating total compliance costs is difficult because neither the government nor taxpayers maintain regular accounts of these costs, and federal tax requirements often overlap with record-keeping and reporting that taxpayers do for other purposes," the GAO wrote. "Although available estimates are uncertain, taken together, they suggest that total compliance costs are large. For example, combining the lowest available estimates for the personal and corporate income tax yields a total of $107 billion (roughly 1 percent of GDP) per year." Other studies, GAO added, estimate costs as 1.5 times as large. We also checked in with Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute who has studied tax compliance costs. He estimated that current compliance costs for all individual filers is about $100 billion, plus nearly another $100 billion for small businesses, plus an undetermined amount for nonprofits and large businesses. Added together, this is likely a bit lower than the Tax Foundation’s projected 2011 figure of $392 billion and significantly lower than Perry’s $500 billion figure. Toder added that Perry’s tax proposal -- keeping the current system, but giving filers an option of paying a flat tax instead -- wouldn’t necessarily reduce compliance costs by much. "If you look at IRS data, you will find that ‘business’ taxpayers -- individuals who complete schedules C, E, or F -- spend a lot more time on their returns than non-business taxpayers," he said. "Business returns are complex because it is hard to determine which expenses are business expenses (deductible) or personal expenses (non-deductible). For example, what share of the expenses of maintaining a car that is used for both business and personal reasons is deductible? None of those types of problems would be made easier by the Perry proposal." Toder added that the biggest part of burden is record-keeping, "which has nothing to do with the cost of completing forms, such as switching to a postcard" -- a centerpiece of Perry’s plan. Our ruling Looking at the Tax Foundation report which Perry used -- as well as alternate analyses of the question -- it’s clear that $500 billion is a high estimate, at least as the numbers stand today. If you define this number narrowly -- to tax preparers and tax lawyers, the groups Perry named specifically -- Perry’s estimate is even further off base. Perry has a valid point to make -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But he not only takes the highest estimate, he also uses a number projected into the future and makes it sound like that's what is being spent today. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-11-07T16:36:30	2011-10-28	['None']
pomt-02250	"A grant for $5,000 [from the Governor’s Workforce Board] went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/13/mike-stenhouse/michael-stenhouse-says-outlandish-state-grant-5000/	Michael Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative think tank, and David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, are on a quest to reduce the cost of government. On April 2, 2014, they released a report listing concrete ways to save nearly $225 million in what they view as wasteful and unnecessary spending in Gov. Lincoln Chafee's proposed budget. In a commentary published that day in The Providence Journal, they listed some eye-catching examples. One was to save $8.4 million by eliminating the Governor’s Workforce Board, saying that despite the claim that it "helps to develop a more skilled and better prepared workforce . . . . there is little indication that the board provides any value to workers, businesses, or taxpayers. In the past year, the Governor’s Workforce Board gave out a number of outlandish grants." Stenhouse and Williams cited two examples. One in particular caught our eye: "A grant for $5,000 went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter." That's an eye-catching claim, and several media outlets quoted it. We were intrigued -- $5,000 to teach one person how to use two immensely popular social media websites? That certainly seemed to qualify as outlandish. We put on our fact-checking hats and tried to learn more. Our first stop: the report released by Stenhouse's and Williams' organizations. It says that the board spent "$5,000 to provide social media training for employees at Ahler's Designs." It linked to a document from the board saying that the training was for three employees -- not one -- plus one student. When we asked Stenhouse about the discrepancy, he contended that he said "an employee," in the commentary, not "one person." We don’t see the difference. Stenhouse also said he forwarded our query to Williams, who did not respond to us. So was the $5,000 spent to teach people about Twitter and Facebook? Yes. And more. According to the grant contract, it covered part of the cost of 32 hours of social media training, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+ and YouTube. It also covered 20 hours of "sales and process" training at Ahlers, a Pawtucket-based company that creates gifts and awards that are hand-crafted in Rhode Island. Rick Brooks, executive director of the Workforce Board, said such grants are designed to improve the skills of current and future workers, and only cover part of the training costs. "We want the business to have some skin in the game," he said. The grants come from the Job Development Fund, which is financed by the payroll tax the state levies on business to cover unemployment insurance. "The money comes from businesses and we make the money available to businesses," said Brooks. In this case, Ahlers Designs asked for help in underwriting its training costs because it was trying to shift its business to focus on custom artwork for individuals and corporations. It needed to train more people in sales and marketing, a job mostly done by CEO Gail Ahlers, according to Ahlers and her grant application. Companies also get a bigger grant if they agree to set up internships, which Ahlers did, training two students, not just the one that it promised to do. That's five people trained with the grant. Both Brooks and Ahlers argued that social media skills are crucial to helping a business succeed in the Internet age, and they involve a lot more than finding friends on Facebook. There are tricks to getting your products listed ahead of others in a Google search, techniques to avoid being smeared online by competitors, and special rules that have to be followed if you're trying to market something on a social media site. "Knowing how to use Facebook for sales is a different skill set" than simply being a casual user, said Brooks. In his email, Stenhouse said, "Taxpayer dollars being spent on something that millions have figured out for themselves is outrageous. We question, however, the public service value of fact-checking the semantic difference between 'an employee' and 'employees’ when a much larger public policy question is at the core of the issue." "Aren't we trying to retrain people so we can keep the jobs? And it's the small companies that really need the help so they can hire more people," Ahlers responded. We'll let others debate whether state funds should be spent on this type of training -- or any training at all. PolitiFact focuses on whether politicians, advocates and pundits can get their facts straight. Our ruling Michael Stenhouse and his coauthor, David Williams, made this provocative claim: "A grant for $5,000 [from the Governor’s Workforce Board] went to teach an employee at a company that makes ornamental business card holders how to use Facebook and Twitter." So let's walk through the important elements. Was it a $5,000 grant? Yes. Was it just "an employee" who got $5,000 worth of training? No. And Stenhouse’s and Williams’ own report acknowledges that. Did the grant go for training to use Facebook and Twitter? Yes. But it was also spent on other forms of social media and involved a lot more than how to "friend" someone or keep a tweet below 140 characters. In addition, nearly 40 percent of the training time was spent on more-traditional sales training. Because the statement contains some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

In a guest column published in The Oregonian, she argues that the ban would allow Washington fisheries to continue to use gillnets in the Columbia River, but not Oregon fisheries. "This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fishermen. Washington commercial fishermen would still be allowed to use gill nets on the Columbia River," she writes. This prompted a query from a reader to PolitiFact Oregon: "Is it true that the measure restricts Oregon fishermen on the same river where Washington fishermen would not be restricted?" Great question. (Readers, send us more questions!) We’d like to add another question to that: Would a ban, if approved by Oregon voters, only apply to Oregon fishermen but exempt Washington fishermen? To explain the answers to these questions, we need to give readers a quick rundown of how fish runs work in the Columbia River. Oregon and Washington have concurrent jurisdiction over the Columbia, which forms much of the border between the two. Nontribal commercial gillnetting is authorized in the 140-mile stretch west of Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean. For the most part, the physical boundary between Oregon and Washington is sliced down the middle of the river. But as you move westward toward the mouth of the river, maps clearly show that more of the Columbia is within the Oregon state line. However, fish don’t respect state lines, so the two states work together to manage for endangered species. Washington and Oregon together decide when to allow sports and commercial fishermen to fish on the river. Washington issues licenses and permits to its people, and Oregon issues licenses and permits to its people and the two states recognize the validity of the other’s licenses and permits in their part of the river. This is all highly regulated and tightly coordinated. The ballot measure aims to amend Oregon Revised Statutes 508.775 to read: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of the commercial fishing laws, it is unlawful for an individual to use a gillnet or tangle net to take salmon, steelhead or other fish in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. (new language is in italics, bold.) So let’s say Oregon voters approve Ballot Measure 81 in November. Would the ban apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen, and not Washington commercial fishermen, in Oregon’s side of the river? No, state law applies equally to all. Would a gillnetting ban mean that Washington commercial fishermen could continue to use gillnets on the Columbia River? Yes, an Oregon ban has no authority in waters outside Oregon. Washington fishermen could continue to use gillnets on their side of the river. We could have split regulation down the river. "This doesn’t apply to Washington," said Rick Hargrave, a spokesman for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. "Washington commercial gillnetters can continue to do their thing in Washington waters." Guy Norman, regional director for Washington’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, says the goal always is concurrent regulation. "However, if we are unable to attain concurrent regulation, for one reason or another, then each state reserves the right to set regulations within their respective boundaries," he said. Certainly this ballot measure would upend the idea of reciprocity between the states. How that plays out, nobody knows yet. For example, will Washington state allow Oregon fishermen to use gillnets in Washington water? Will Washington follow Oregon in prohibiting gillnets? Those are policy questions for Washington to address. Likewise, we don’t know the logistics of how enforcement might be carried out. PolitiFact Oregon can’t rule on how Washington might respond should the measure be approved, because those decisions haven’t been made. But we can rule on what the measure says it will do, and there’s no real argument from the two campaign sides: Ballot Measure 81 prohibits the use of gillnets in the inland waters of the state of Oregon. The point made by Brenda Wall is that the measure does nothing to prevent Washington commercial fishermen from using gillnets on their side of the river. The "Stop Gillnets Now" campaign objects to the assessment because Wall gives the impression that Washington fishermen can continue to use gillnets throughout the Columbia, when they wouldn’t. They would be limited to their side of the river. It is not accurate to say that the Oregon ban would apply only to Oregon commercial fishermen. It is accurate to say that Washington commercial fishermen can continue to use gillnets in the Columbia -- so long as they stick to their side of the river. One part of the statement is true and the other part is not true. We split the statement -- like the Columbia River -- down the middle and rate it Half True.

pomt-01820	The Obama Administration is suing a Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speak English.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/20/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-feds-sued-company-requiring-workers/	In the fall of 2012, Wisconsin Plastics, Inc., a Green Bay-area manufacturer, fired 22 people, most of them Hmong or Hispanic workers. The action led to a lawsuit against the company by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which argues the workers’ civil rights were violated. The agency sued June 9, 2014 after its mediation efforts failed. The lawsuit alleges that the workers were fired based on 10-minute observations that marked them down for their English skills, even though those skills were not needed to perform their jobs. Several weeks after the suit was filed, the case caught fire. Fox News did a piece on it, criticizing the government’s case. And a series of conservative blogs slammed the agency’s actions, including FreePatriot.org. A PolitiFact Wisconsin reader came across that post and asked us to examine it. The posting carried this headline: "Obama administration suing Wisconsin company for forcing employees to speaking English." Yes, it said "speaking English." But we’re not here to check typos. In any case, the claim is a good one for a fact check: Is the Obama Administration suing a Wisconsin company "for forcing employees to speak English." We started with the author of the FreePatroit item, Tim Walker, who blogs from the Philippines. In an email, he said the sole source for his item was RightWingNews.com which had posted an item with this headline: "Feds suing county in Wisconsin for requiring workers to speak English." (That headline is actually incorrect, because a business is being sued, not a county.) The Rightwingnews.com item linked to an item from a site called Weasel Zippers, which had reposted an item from Judicial Watch that carried this headline: "U.S. sues American co. for requiring workers to speak English." In each case, the bloggers claim the EEOC lawsuit is about workers forced to speak English -- what the agency terms an "English only" case. These cases revolve around situations where workers are required to speak English at work or when interacting with customers. But the EEOC says the bloggers got it wrong. So does the company. What the agency says When we contacted the EEOC, agency attorney Cesar del Peral said the case is about the rights of the employees being violated because they had been subjected to "a sham performance improvement plan" that pointed out a lack of language skills. The complaint says that the firings violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects employees from discrimination based on national origin, which includes the linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. "The company based its decisions on English language fluency," said del Peral, who noted that some of the dismissed employees had been with the company for seven to 10 years and had previously received satisfactory performance evaluations. Del Peral said the case was different from other actions that the agency has taken against companies who have "English only" rules. He noted the suit doesn’t allege that "anyone was forced to speak English or that anyone refused." The company’s side After the blog postings started to appear, the company issued a July 2, 2014 news release that criticized the posts and said language was not a factor in the firings. "The recent story regarding the EEOC lawsuit filed against Wisconsin Plastics, Inc. is sensationalizing a lawsuit that has no merit," said Bruce Wendt, vice president of operations, in the statement. "WPI is proud to have a diversified workforce and have interpreters on staff to accommodate the language needs of our workforce." The statement also said: "The reality is the decision to lay off employees in the fall of 2012 was made based on the employees’ overall comparative skills, behaviors and job performance over time." So, where did the English-only idea picked up by the bloggers come from? Once we plowed through numerous web sites to the source, we discovered a sloppy EEOC news release. The agency’s June 9, 2014 release included this statement: "Our experience at the EEOC has been that so-called 'English only' rules and requirements of English fluency are often employed to make what is really discrimination appear acceptable," said John C. Hendrickson, EEOC Chicago regional attorney. "But superficial appearances are not fooling anyone," he said. "When speaking English fluently is not, in fact, required for the safe and effective performance of a job, nor the successful operation of the employer's business, requiring employees to be fluent in English usually constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin -- and thus violates federal law." When asked about the news release, Hendrickson backed away from the statement about English Only rules in the case. The "EEOC does not contend that Wisconsin Plastics either has an ‘English Only Rule’ or that the charging parties were terminated because of the failure or refusal to obey an such rule. Perhaps my reference to English Only Rules was therefore not helpful," he wrote in an email. The statement continued: "Our contention is that they were terminated on account of their national origin and that termination followed some sort of test of their fluency in English -- notwithstanding the fact that fluency in English was not required for the performance of their jobs (as evidenced by their prior successful performance of those jobs)." Our rating Various blogs said that the EEOC sued Wisconsin Plastics because the company "forced employees to speak English." That’s not what the lawsuit says. The complaint says the company violated workers’ civil rights by subjecting them to a sham performance exam that focused on English language skills. Even the company says the bloggers, while trying to sympathize with it, took matters too far and sensationalized the lawsuit. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01277	"25,000 businesses have been created since (Scott) Walker took office."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/03/republican-party-wisconsin/state-republican-party-25000-new-businesses-under-/	The Republican Party of Wisconsin may have committed a Freudian slip in its Oct. 29, 2014 news release touting Gov. Scott Walker’s accomplishments. "Over 110,000 new jobs and 25,0000 businesses have been created since Walker took office," the release originally said. We noted the extra zero on that second figure, an echo perhaps of Walker’s promise that Wisconsin would create 250,000 private-sector jobs on his watch. (He will fall far short and we have rated it Promise Broken). But what really got our attention was the corrected version of the release, which says 25,000 new businesses have sprung up since Walker took office in January 2011. It’s a nice round number, and a sharp contrast to what the GOP said in an earlier news release -- that 27,000 businesses "fled the state" due to the policies of former Gov. Jim Doyle and Mary Burke, the former state Commerce secretary trying to unseat Walker in the Nov. 4 governor’s race. We’ve heard the 25,000 new businesses claim before -- Walker’s campaign uses it, pointing to figures published by a state agency, the Department of Financial Institutions. The agency reports the number of registered "business entities" in Wisconsin, including filings by newly formed business corporations, non-stock nonprofit corporations, cooperatives, limited partnerships, limited liability companies and partnerships, common law trusts, veterans organizations and certain religious corporations. The numbers rise and fall as some entities fall away and others are created, giving what economists say is a rough sense of economic activity. The net gain in the number of active entities during Walker’s three-plus years is 24,947, or a 7 percent increase. (There were 389,316 business entities registered as of Sept. 30, 2014). So that’s the 25,000 figure in the GOP claim. That’s far from the end of the story. That number turns out, in many cases, to have very little to do with actual operating businesses and job creation. We’ve closely examined this issue before. In May 2014, we reported that the count of newly registered "business entities" includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. That analysis by PolitiFact Wisconsin found that the count includes: -- Thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. Even investors as far away as Australia are on the list because they bought Wisconsin rental properties. -- Out-of-state firms that registered in Wisconsin because they may want to do work here. -- Hundreds of nonprofit organizations, often volunteer-run, including Scout troops, condo associations, youth sports leagues, volunteer fire departments, historical societies, "friends" fundraising groups, scholarship funds and many more. -- Startups that are just getting organized and not yet able to pay employees. As PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted several times in evaluating Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new businesses in his term, business experts caution that many LLCs are set up for tax and liability purposes and employ no one. To judge Walker’s final progress on his new business promise, we will also consider a second measure related to business formations -- the number of new locations, or "business establishments," set up by companies. We reported in September that the state had added 6,657 such establishments through March 2014. To be sure, there are many job-producing startups among the thousands of entities cited by the GOP. But it’s impossible to say, without calling every person registering a new firm, exactly how many fit in that category. It is easy, however, to say the GOP claim, which ignores the thousands of non-operating businesses in the mix, is far off the mark. At the same time, the party’s characterization of a net loss of business entity filings during the Doyle years as firms having "fled the state" is off base. The drop reflected the slowdown in business activity during the Great Recession, but there is no official tally of how many active employers shut down or picked up and left. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claimed that "25,000 businesses have been created since Walker took office." There’s an element of truth: that’s the number of business "entities" that were created. But portraying these registrations as businesses in the context of job creation is a major stretch because many are just corporate shells, non profit organizations, reconstituted versions of existing businesses and out-of-state firms. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2014-11-03T05:00:00	2014-10-29	['None']
pomt-04758	Says our national debt is greater than our gross domestic product.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-addressing-delegates-says-national-debt-e/	Rallying delegates at the Republican National Convention, Ted Cruz mentioned his eldest daughter to make a point about the rising national debt. Cruz, Texas’ Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison, said the national debt -- $10 trillion when his daughter, Caroline, was born -- had spiked to $16 trillion as of today, "larger than our gross domestic product." (The debt was more than $9.6 trillion in late August 2008, according to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, and nearly $16 trillion as of Aug. 27, 2012). We wondered if the debt is really bigger than the Gross Domestic Product, the marquee measure of national economic output. The government defines the GDP as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. A footnote to the prepared text of Cruz’s Aug. 28, 2012, convention speech attributes his conclusion to an Oct. 20, 2011, blog post by the Atlantic magazine suggesting the debt would surpass the nation’s GDP by the end of that month. We looked for what has happened since that speculation. Fortuitously, we’d started exploring this topic when Cruz aired a similar comparison during an Aug. 27, 2012, interview with Alana Rocha, a convention reporter for YNN Austin. In a March 13, 2012, blog post, the anti-deficit Concord Coalition said the gross debt would top the nation’s GDP this year for the first time since World War II. Projections showed the gross debt continuing to increase rapidly "as we continue to borrow and as today’s unusually low interest rates eventually rise toward their historic average," the group wrote. The gross debt is best understood in two parts. Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, which is why the coalition tends to focus on it, Josh Gordon, a coalition analyst, told us by phone. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." An August 2011 fact check quoted Gary Therkildsen, a fiscal policy analyst at OMB Watch, a nonprofit government-accountability group, as saying that’s why the public debt, not the gross debt, is what’s most important for understanding the government’s fiscal health. PolitiFact Ohio rated Mostly True a claim by the state’s Republican Sen. Rob Portman that the nation’s debt was equal to 100 percent of its GDP. The total debt then amounted to 97.2 percent of the GDP, while the public debt was equivalent to 66 percent of the GDP. According to a July 27, 2010, report on the federal debt by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the ratio of the public debt to GDP had previously exceeded 50 percent once before -- during and shortly after WW II. Gordon pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office said in its Aug. 22, 2012, update on the nation’s economic outlook that by October 2012, the public debt would reach 73 percent of GDP -- the highest level since 1950, the report said, and about twice the share that it measured at the end of September 2007, before the financial crisis and recent recession. The report says too that if deficits continue apace, "debt held by the public would climb to 90 percent of GDP by 2022 -- higher than at any time since shortly after World War II." Such background in hand, we looked at Cruz’s comparison both by considering the gross debt versus the GDP and by weighing just the public debt against it. According to the U.S. Treasury’s Debt to the Penny web page, the gross federal debt on Aug. 27, 2012, was more than $15.9 trillion, counting nearly $11.2 trillion in public debt and nearly $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental holdings -- that money owed within the government. The size of the U.S. economy, measured by the GDP, was more than $15.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2012, the most recent quarter for which data are available. This number comes from a chart, last revised July 27, 2012, downloadable from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. To ensure more of an apples-to-apples comparison, we checked the total national debt toward the end of the second quarter, at about the time the GDP was more than $15.6 trillion. The total debt as of June 29, 2012, was more than $15.8 trillion; the public debt portion was $11 trillion. At this pass, then, Cruz’s comparison holds. Gross debt outpaces the GDP by $200 billion to $300 billion. But the public debt was equal to about 71 to 72 percent of the GDP, depending on which public debt figure is used. The public debt has been running $4.4 trillion to $4.6 trillion behind the GDP. Gordon said it’s questionable that the ratio of the debt to GDP means much except as a reminder that the debt continues to rise. "Is there an economic difference in (the debt) being lower than the GDP or higher? No, there isn’t. It doesn’t make a difference," Gordon said. "There is no magic line that you’ve crossed." Jason Pequet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, floated a slightly different interpretation, saying that while no expert knows the precise level at which debt eclipsing some threshold of the GDP will start significantly holding back the American economy, research by Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff and others of debt-to-GDP ratios in other countries suggests that once the gross debt exceeds about 90 percent of the GDP, economic growth starts to noticeably slow. Pequet cautioned, though, that the United States has unique powerful advantages in that its economy is the world’s largest and the American dollar doubles as the world’s reserve currency. It’s not certain that the debt exceeding the GDP is, or will, have the same effects here as in other countries. Summing up, he said, the relationship of debt to the GDP is not an arbitrary threshold because it "shows the ability of your economy to pay for and finance that debt going forward." Our ruling The total federal debt exceeds the nation’s economic output or GDP. However, the public debt -- borrowing that relates to the economy’s strength -- hovers below three quarters of the GDP. We rate this claim as Half True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2012-08-28T20:56:26	2012-08-28	['None']
pomt-06386	Says the main Central Texas food bank is delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than three years ago.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/01/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-central-texas-food-bank-deliver/	In a September 2011 floor speech, Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin spoke of two concerns he said are growing in the Lone Star State: poverty and hunger. Doggett said that in tough times, more families are turning to food banks, creating "immense" demand. Among his examples: The Austin-based Capital Area Food Bank of Texas "this year is delivering 50 percent more food to poor people than it did three years ago." In his speech, Doggett attributed that figure to John Turner, a food bank official. We wondered if the proclaimed increase was correct, and if so, whether that accurately reflected a surge in hunger in our area. The food bank, founded in 1981, takes in donations of food and money from the government, the food industry and the public, then distributes food to Central Texas residents directly and through more than 350 agencies in its 21-county service area roughly centered on Travis and Williamson counties. (Click to view a map.) The region’s north edge runs from Mills County in the west to Freestone County in the east; its south edge runs from Gillespie and Blanco counties in the west to Fayette County on the east. Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by email that Doggett drew his 50 percent figure from a Sept. 4, 2011, news story in the Guardian, a British newspaper, which quotes Turner saying the food bank was delivering 50 percent more food to the poor than it had done three years ago. In an interview, Turner, the food bank’s senior director for marketing and branding, recently told us he’d given the Guardian a conservative estimate: The pounds of food distributed by the bank had actually increased 64 percent, going from 15.4 million pounds in 2007 to 25.3 million pounds in 2010. Turner noted, too, that the 2010 poundage was inflated by one-time federal stimulus aid enabling the bank to buy an additional 2.3 million pounds for the Summer Food Nutrition Program. Subtract that, and the 2010 figure becomes 23 million pounds -- up 49 percent from what the bank gave out in 2007. So, do the poundage figures mean hunger in the area shot up 49 percent or more over the past few years? J.C. Dwyer of the Texas Food Bank Network, the state association of food banks, told us pounds of food distributed generally isn't the best measure of need in a food bank's region: "It’s more of a metric for how we’re dealing with the needs," Dwyer said. A better way of gauging needs, he said, is to track the number of residents requesting food assistance. That is, the amount of food distributed doesn't necessarily reflect ups and downs in need. In the holiday season, donations and distributions surge, for instance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean surges in need. Dwyer and Turner each suggested we check on changes in food demands through "Hunger in America," a report commissioned every four years by Feeding America, a national charity that acts as a clearinghouse connecting food supplies to 200 food banks, including the one in Austin. There was no "Hunger in America" report for 2007, the first year in Doggett’s statement, but the reports based on surveys in 2005 and 2009 were broken down into smaller reports covering the Austin bank’s 21-county region: In 2005, the Capital Area bank fed an estimated 174,900 people. In 2009, the estimated number of people served was 284,900 for the year, up 63 percent from those who were served in 2005. That change outstripped population growth, according to U.S. census estimates. In 2005, the 21 counties had 2,265,981 residents. By 2009, the region’s population was 2,547,559 -- up 12.4 percent. Put another way, the food bank provided sustenance to nearly 8 percent of the region’s residents in 2005 while about 11 percent of a greater total of residents got food in 2009. Finally, we wondered if Doggett was correct in saying the food aid went to the poor alone. Turner told us the bank does not question people who come seeking food as to their income -- if you show up, you are fed, he said, though depending on the lines that form, it could take an hour or two. However, the "Hunger in America" report using 2009 data states that 73 percent of the Capital Area food bank’s clients had incomes below the federal poverty level. Census figures for 2010, drawing on 2009 data, show that poverty in the 21-county region matched the percentage for Texas overall: Seventeen percent of residents had income below the federal poverty level. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Dwyer told us, "food insecurity" across Texas -- the percentage of households at risk of missing meals because of financial pressure -- rose from 14.8 percent in the three-year period 2005-07 to 18.8 percent in 2008-10. Our conclusion: Changes in the amount of food distributed over several years, which Doggett cited, might not be the best way to gauge changes in residents’ needs. That said, the number of Central Texas requestors for food aid over those years outpaced regional population growth. The 63 percent increase in requestors also exceeded the 50-percent increase in food distributed that he stressed, though, contrary to his statement, not all those pounds of food went to "the poor." We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2011-11-01T06:00:00	2011-09-21	['None']
pomt-06943	"Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/19/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-said-economy-has-grown-or-been-dam/	Nobody opposes tax increases quite like Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. For example, comedian Stephen Colbert recently asked Norquist what he would do if terrorists kidnapped all of our grandmothers and threatened to kill them with fire ants. Their ransom demand? Tax increases on the wealthiest 2 percent of all Americans. Would Norquist give in? "I think we console ourself with the fact that we have pictures," he said. He was kidding, right? It's hard to tell. In a more serious vein, Norquist was interviewed on July 13, 2011, by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, who also asked Norquist about taxes on wealthy Americans. "John Paulson, who's a hedge fund manager, he made last year $4.9 billion. Billion with a 'B.' Not million but $4.9 billion. And a big chunk of that income was taxed at 15 percent, not the maximum 35 percent, because it was seen as some sort of capital gains or whatever. Is that fair?" Blitzer asked. "Well, certainly the Democrats have been arguing to raise the capital gains tax on all Americans. Obama says he wants to do that," Norquist said. "That would slow down economic growth. It's not necessarily helpful to the economy. Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged. It's one of those taxes that most clearly damages economic growth and jobs." We decided to check Norquist's claim on capital gains taxes. We contacted his organization, Americans for Tax Reform, but we didn't hear back. What are capital gains taxes? If your only income is normal wages, you've probably never paid them. But here's how they work: When you sell an asset, such as a share of stock, for a profit, that profit is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the taxpayer's income and the length of the investment. But most long-term capital gains are taxed at 15 percent, less than many people pay in income taxes. (The top income tax rate is now 35 percent.) The idea is that a lower tax rate encourages investment and economic growth. Blitzer, though, was talking about a loophole that allows compensation paid to investment fund managers, including hedge fund managers, to be treated as capital gains, not income. Over the years, capital gains taxes have gone up and down, providing lots of fodder for economic analysis. They increased in 1986 under President Ronald Reagan, decreased under President Bill Clinton in 1997 and decreased under President George W. Bush in 2003. We should note that these changes have taken place as part of packages of other tax cuts and tax increases, usually alongside changes to income tax rates. We decided to compare charts of annual economic growth rates compared with capital gains tax rates to see what we would find. In one column, we listed the percentage growth using inflation-adjusted numbers for the Gross Domestic Product as compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the other column, we included the maximum tax rate for long-term capital gains taxes, as compiled by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, going back to 1977. The Tax Policy Center's rates tend to be just a bit higher than statutory rates because it accounts for other parts of the tax code that interacted with the capital gains tax rate. We noted exceptions in 1982 (tax rates were lower, but the economy declined); in 1987 (tax rates increased, but the economy still grew); and in 1993 (tax rates increased slightly, and the economy still grew.) We looked for other research on the issue and found that Troy Kravitz and Leonard Burman put Norquist’s contention to the test in a simple study published in the respected nonpartisan journal Tax Notes in 2005. They looked at changes to capital gains taxes and compared them with both to stock market performance and overall economic growth. They found a weak relationship between tax changes and the stock market, but virtually no correlation to overall economic growth, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). "Capital gains rates display no contemporaneous correlation with real GDP growth during the last 50 years," they noted. They also tested whether the tax changes had any delayed effects, testing lags up to five years, but found no statistically significant effect. On the issue of stock market growth, they noted that pension funds and foreign investors don't pay capital gains taxes the same way that individual investors do. "Thus, capital gains tax rates can increase significantly, as they did following the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and have little apparent effect on the stock market," the report said. "Likewise, the stock market can fluctuate even when rates remain unchanged." We consulted a number of tax policy experts who considered the study sound and knew of no evidence to contradict it. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analysis agency for the U.S. Congress, compiled research on capital gains taxes and concluded that reductions to capital gains taxes are "unlikely to have much effect" on economic growth. "A tax reduction on capital gains would mostly benefit very high income taxpayers, who are likely to save most of any tax reduction," the report said. Does this mean reductions in capital gains taxes don't cause the economy to grow? We asked Burman, who conducted the Tax Notes study and is the author of The Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed. "It doesn't rule out that there could be a connection," he said. But in practice, he said, "It's as likely to do damage as to help." That's because when the capital gains tax rate is lower than that of regular income, people look for ways to avoid taxes by converting regular income to capital gains income -- just as Blitzer's question suggested. In our queries of tax experts, we found a wide difference of opinion on the capital gains tax itself. Here's the "pro" view, from economist J.D. Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation: "I believe capital gains taxation is a uniquely powerful tool for good or evil in terms of economic growth because it strikes at the heart of the most productive, transformational forms of investment. What kind of investment is that? Long-term, high risk investment. So changes in the tax treatment either way doesn't turn the economic world on a dime. It's a powerful influence, but not one that can be reliably sifted from the data either way." Alternatively, here's the "con" view from David Rosenbloom, a tax law professor at New York University: "The best tax policy would not have a difference as between capital gains and ordinary income because there is no compelling reason for any such distinction, and it enormously complicates the Internal Revenue Code. We had such a best policy, briefly, following passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, in Reagan's second term. Everything was taxed at a top rate of 28 percent (with a few minor deviations). Does Norquist think that was so bad? For heaven's sake, why? And we have had extraordinarily low rates on capital gains since the first years of the Bush II Administartion (and still have them today). Does Norquist think the economy has done splendidly during the ensuing years? What have I missed?" Getting back to Norquist's statement, he said, "Every time we've cut the capital gains tax, the economy has grown. Whenever we raise the capital gains tax, it's been damaged." Clearly, he intends that as a statement of causation. But the analysis of Kravitz and Burman rebuts that. They found no evidence of a connection between actual economic growth and changes in capital gains tax rates. The actual effect of capital gains tax rates remains a hotly contested issue. We rate Norquist's statement False.	None	Grover Norquist	None	None	None	2011-07-19T17:42:00	2011-07-13	['None']
pomt-00531	The Confederate battle flag at the South Carolina statehouse "must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/21/jean-casarez/flying-confederate-battle-flag-south-carolina-half/	The massacre of nine African-Americans at a Charleston, S.C., church June 17 has renewed calls to remove a Confederate battle flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse. The NAACP, which has long requested the flag’s removal from a monument to Confederate soldiers at the statehouse in Columbia, reiterated its call this week, joined by countless politicians and almost 400,000 petitioners. Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property. One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21. "By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet," she said. "Any changes — taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done — must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly." We’ve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look. South Carolina’s Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But according to her spokesperson, it’s the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. Title 1 Chapter 10 of state law spells it out: "The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet." "The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly." The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. James E. Smith, who doubts the law’s constitutionality and who’s been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds. The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since 2000, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third's vote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.) While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasn’t flying at full-staff. "It’s not a flag of sovereignty, it’s a veterans’ battle flag. … Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but it’s not," said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasn’t lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries. Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: "That’s beside the point. It shouldn’t be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled." Republican State Rep. Norman "Doug" Brannon told MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon won’t be the only one, said Statehouse Report editor and publisher Andy Brack. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, he’d like a unanimous vote.) "These deaths — especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney) — might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence," Brack said. "If the issue becomes a hot-button issue — so hot that legislators fear they'll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing — they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police." "The atmosphere is changing it appears," said Don Gordon, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. "The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter's Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism." Our ruling A CNN reporter said, "By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly." In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flag’s location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers’ Monument on the capitol grounds. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03457	"Immigrants are more fertile."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/18/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-immigrants-are-more-fertile/	The aging of America draws a lot of attention as the country tries to control the rising cost of health care and sustain critical programs such as Social Security. Jeb Bush, former Republican governor of Florida and potential 2016 presidential candidate, has a partial solution -- promote immigration. Bush, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington, made a pitch for immigration reform, saying America needs more new workers to help pay for retirees -- "to rebuild the demographic pyramid" as he put it. "Immigrants are more fertile," Bush said. "And they love families and they have more intact families, and they bring a younger population. Immigrants create an engine of economic prosperity." Bush’s reference to the fertility of immigrants stirred up an immediate flurry of activity on Twitter and the comment sections of news websites. Some said his words were callous, some said he was simply speaking the truth. We decided to take an evidence-based look into the fertility of immigrants. The key here is understanding the meaning of the word "fertile." Fertility can mean the ability to have children, but it can also refer to the birth rate of a population. In context, Bush's comments clearly referred to the second definition. We contacted Bush’s office; his spokesperson, Jaryn Emhoff, told us Bush was referring to birth rate. On that front, there is no debate about the numbers. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that the birth rate among foreign-born women was nearly 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women -- 87.8 births per 1,000 women compared with 58.9 births per 1,000 women of prime child bearing age (15-44). A major reason why immigrant birth rates are higher has to do with the age of new arrivals; as a group, they skew young, which means more of them are likely to be ready to start families. If you looked at a group of foreign-born women and the same number of U.S.-born women, all between 15 and 44 years old, you would find more women closer to 20 years old among the immigrants. However, the Pew report noted an important trend. While birth rates for all women dropped between 2007 and 2010, it fell much faster among immigrant women. It declined by 14 percent compared with 6 percent for women born in America. Analysts differ on what is driving this change, and the debate has some bearing on Bush’s main interest in promoting immigration. The Pew researchers believe the data shows that these women are simply not having children. An alternative explanation is that there are fewer young immigrant women. Emilio Parrado, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, leans towards that one. Parrado said that the data tell him that the real reason for the drop in the immigrant birth rate is the recession. With fewer jobs in America, fewer people had the incentive to come. "There are no new entrants," Parrado said. "The immigrants who are already in the U.S. have already completed their family size, so they are no longer having kids and rates are declining." This debate has significant implications for Bush’s argument on immigration. If birth rates for immigrants continue to drop, then immigration reform as a way to rebalance the country’s age distribution is not simply a matter of creating a legal option for those who are already here. It requires a steady influx of newcomers. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that opposes high levels of immigration, said it is easy to overstate the benefits of attracting people from other countries. He noted that the children of foreign-born women still represent a significantly smaller slice of all births. This shows up in the data. The overall birth rate in the Pew report is 64 per 1,000 -- for U.S.-born women it is 58.9. "Immigrants do pull up the average but not by very much," Camarota said. To really change the birth rate, Camarota said a much larger number of immigrants would be needed. We should also note that it’s not a good idea to lump all immigrants together. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the country of origin can have a big impact on fertility rates. For mothers from Mexico, the rate is 77; that jumps by about a third for people from Central and South America. For mothers from Asia, the rate is 59 per 1,000. In addition, rates can change from one generation to the next. A paper presented at the Population Association of America 2013 conference found significant shifts among first-, second- and third-generation immigrant families. In terms of the number of children a woman will have in her lifetime, fertility falls steadily among Asians, from 1.84 in the first generation to 1.3 by the third. In contrast, Hispanic women show a dramatic decline from the first to second generation -- 2.41 to 1.9. But in the third generation, the number rises to 2.1. Our ruling Bush said that immigrants are more fertile and the data back him up. National statistics show that birth rates among foreign-born residents are about 50 percent higher than for U.S.-born women. However, the rates are converging, they vary widely among immigrant groups and over the years, the rates change. Still, Bush’s words were on track, and we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05355	Says George Flinn has been a "no show" at scheduled "forums."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/11/charlotte-bergmann/gop-2010-nominee-congress-says-george-flinn-confir/	When is a no-show not a no-show? That’s at issue in an ongoing contretemps between the Charlotte Bergmann and George Flinn campaigns for the Republican nomination for the 9th Congressional District. Bergmann, the 2010 GOP nominee who got 25 percent of the vote in her loss to incumbent Democrat Steve Cohen, contends Flinn was a "no show" at recent scheduled "forums." In a press release in early April, Bergmann said that Flinn "has been invited to forums where he can make his case for his bid for office, he confirms his attendance, then does not show." In the paragraph following that assertion, Bergmann asks where Flinn was in the previous 30 days when she attended meetings of the Republican Women of Purpose, the Shelby County Republican Women, the Collierville Republican Club, and the East Shelby Republican Club. The clear implication is that those were forums where Flinn confirmed and was a no-show. We decided to determine whether Flinn, a former Shelby County commissioner who spent $3.5 million in finishing third for the 8th Congressional District nomination in 2010, did in fact duck those events and others Bergmann’s campaign subsequently said he missed with the Midtown Republicans on March 27 and two events it called "forums" -- on April 12 at The Cupboard restaurant and on April 27 at Tom Lee Park. Is it true that Flinn, a wealthy Memphis radiologist and radio station magnate, confirmed his attendance then did "not show" up to various events for Shelby County Republicans? We asked Bergmann’s campaign for the specifics of the events at issue and campaign manager Randy Lawson provided details. Then we checked in with the presumably jilted hosts of the events and with Flinn’s campaign. Republican Women of Purpose spokeswoman Mary Jane Anderson of Germantown emailed us: "After checking the records, I will tell you that this did not happen." She said Flinn spoke to the group when he was running for the 8th Congressional District seat in 2010 but "other than that, Dr. Flinn has not been invited to speak at our meetings." Shelby County Republican Women’s Club president Debbie Stamson said she couldn’t recall whether Flinn attended the club’s luncheon in March but was on hand at both its April 10 and May 8 luncheons. In April, she said, "we didn’t really have a speaker because we had a fashion show." As for whether he confirmed his attendance in advance by making a reservation, Stamson said she couldn’t say. But he wasn’t a no-show; he was there. Stamson made another curious observation: "Normally, she (Bergmann) comes to our meetings. She was not there April 10." Collierville Republican Club president and Collierville vice mayor Tony Sarwar, who owns the restaurant where the group meets, said, "we’ve never had a situation when Dr. Flinn ever cancelled out on us or was ever supposed to be . . . the main speaker for the evening and cancel on us. . . . As far as I recall, I think Dr. Flinn has been there less than a handful of times." But Flinn’s campaign manager, Kristi Stanley made two salient points: first, the Collierville club’s March 20 meeting agenda dealt with school board issues, not Congressional races; and second, Collierville (like Germantown) is actually no longer in the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District. East Shelby Republican Club president Arnold Weiner, who will be a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Tampa this summer, said he would not take sides in the Bergmann-Flinn contest. Told that all he was being asked to confirm was whether Flinn had been invited to speak to his group and had not shown up, Weiner said: "No." And added: "We’re going to have a candidate forum in July. But there’s never been anything -- official forum -- where he has been a no-show." Stanley says Flinn regrets a conflict prevented him from addressing the Midtown Republican Club on March 27, but notified the club in advance that he would not be there. The campaign sent consultant Gene Bryan to speak in Flinn’s behalf to the Midtowners. Lawson said Bergmann also did not attend that event and sent a surrogate -- because the campaign learned, before the event, that Flinn would not attend. As for the noon forum at The Cupboard forum on April 12, Stanley says the campaign never received an invitation. Members of the news media, however, were informed of the event by email on April 10, so it’s likely Flinn’s people were at least aware of it. A back room of the restaurant was reserved by Bergmann’s campaign manager for a private party of 20, records show, and that gathering did occur, according to Cupboard manager Darla Morgan. A video of the April 27 event at Tom Lee Park captures the drama of the session in which a squawking rubber chicken in a folding chair stands in for Flinn. Again, Stanley said Flinn never received an invitation and said her review of the video indicates the "debate" didn’t have a sponsor; it was a Bergmann campaign media event. "Did they plan on us not being there, so they brought the rubber chicken?" she asks. The video shows the moderator, Bartlett City Alderman David Parsons, asking both Bergmann and the rubber chicken about jobs, energy and "restoring liberty," with the Mississippi River and the Arkansas shoreline as backdrop. In Bergmann’s remarks, she said, among other things, that she was looking forward to going "toe-to-toe" in the House Chamber’s well with 21-year veteran California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. At the end of the video event, Parsons says, "I’d like to thank all the listening audience out there for participating today and joining us down here at Tom Lee Park." But, in the course of the "debate," the camera scanning the park and bluff beyond where an audience should be visible shows no one there. Who Parsons was thanking is a mystery since an audience, in this case, was the no show. Parsons has not responded to email and voicemail messages seeking clarification. Our ruling Charlotte Bergmann’s 9th Congressional District campaign claims that George Flinn, her Republican primary opponent, has a pattern of confirming his attendance at partisan forums and then not showing up, and is seeking to label him a "chicken," unwilling to debate. But the evidence shows Flinn has either attended events or sent his regrets in advance. We rate Bergmann’s claim False.	None	Charlotte Bergmann	None	None	None	2012-05-11T06:00:00	2012-04-10	['None']
pomt-00442	"Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/aug/22/unite-here-florida-pac/florida-governors-race-ad-attacks-gwen-graham-mega/	Democrat Gwen Graham is facing attacks for her family’s role in the American Dream mega-mall project in Miami. Unite Here Florida PAC, a union group that represents service industry workers, launched a TV ad that refers to the Graham family and the project as "their controversial mega-mall." "Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall," says the text of the ad. "60 percent of the jobs at the American Dream Mall will be low-wage. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." The ad is running in advance of the Aug. 28 primary for governor. A union associated with the PAC has endorsed Philip Levine, one of Graham’s Democratic rivals. Levine said he is against the development, citing low-wage jobs and traffic. The ad overstates the role of Graham and her family in the project, and more context is needed about the low-wage jobs and impact on wildlife and traffic. The PAC sent us information from local news reports, as well as county records about the project. American Dream Miami mall project Graham Companies is involved in the mall project. But Graham has not served on the board for the company since she won elected office, and her family is not the project developer. When Graham started in Congress in 2015, she stepped down from the company and put all of her assets in a transparent trust. Graham owns about $13.7 million million in company stock, and made about $830,000 in income in 2017, according to her financial disclosure. Her campaign spokesman said she owns less than 1 percent of voting stock. Graham said if the state had to act on the project and she were governor, she would recuse herself and let her elected counterparts on the Cabinet make decisions. Graham has emphasized that her family isn’t the developer. "My family is not building a mall. Period. End of story," she said during a forum in Jacksonville. It’s true that her family isn’t building the mall, but approximately 80 acres owned by the Graham Companies is under contract for purchase by the American Dream developers, said Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, the developer’s lobbyist. That piece of land is a little less than half of the 174-acre project. Triple Five, the company that developed Minnesota's Mall of America, wants to build the $4 billion mall project, which includes an indoor ski slope, hotel and a submarine lake. The project between Interstate 75 and Florida’s Turnpike in northwest Miami-Dade County is expected to draw 30 million visitors a year. Diaz de la Portilla said the amount of money the Graham Companies will receive from the land sale is confidential. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate research analyst who isn’t involved in the project, estimated that the 80 acres would sell for between $2.4 million and $6.5 million. The Graham Companies is also planning to build a mixed-used development on 300 acres south of the mall. In May, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted in favor of zoning approval for the mall. In July, the South Florida Regional Planning Council voted against the project but that is largely symbolic because the county and the state have authority. It still has to go through several other approvals before it is built. "Poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." County records show the American Dream will create about 14,530 permanent full-time jobs. About 64 percent of those workers would earn less than $25,000 a year. The federal poverty guideline is $25,100 for a family of four. For an individual it is $12,140. Diaz de la Portilla said the developer projects 25,000 permanent direct and indirect jobs based on the developer’s experience at other malls. He said the county used a specific model to project a range of direct jobs of 9,236 to 22,331. The project has drawn criticism from environmentalists, such as the Sierra Club and Everglades Trust. The trust endorsed Graham in spite of it. "While we are fighting like the dickens to ensure the survival of the Everglades and the source of drinking water for eight million Floridians, mega-developers and projects like these continue to put it all at risk," said Everglades Trust executive director Kimberly Mitchell. The county staff analysis, which recommended approval, stated that the site contains wetlands. It also stated that the site is within the core foraging area of wood stork colonies and may provide habitat and/or foraging areas for several threatened and endangered animal species. The county’s environmental resources department drafted provisions within the development agreement related to stormwater management, natural resources and endangered species, Diaz de la Portilla said. The project is expected to generate 70,000 vehicle trips a day. Diaz de la Portilla said that the developer has to mitigate the impacts on the environment and the traffic, which includes spending more than $200 million on road infrastructure and public transportation. He said that the site has been inside the county’s Urban Development Boundary for over a decade. Our ruling A Unite Here Florida TV ad said, "Gwen Graham owns a $14 million stake in her family’s company that’s behind the American Dream Mall. ... While Graham and her family will make millions, Florida will be stuck with poverty wage jobs, endangered wildlife and massive traffic congestion." The ad was imprecise when it said that her family’s company is "behind the American Dream Mall." That could create a misleading impression that her family is developing the mall. Her family owns about 80 acres which is under contract for the developer, less than half of the future mall site. We don’t know how much Graham and her family will earn from the sale of the land, which is under contract, but one real estate analyst told us the sale could be for millions of dollars. Graham’s financial disclosure shows she owned $13.7 million in stock in the Graham Companies in 2017. Graham has not been on the board of her family's company since she won elected office. About two-thirds of the permanent jobs will pay less than $25,000. That is the federal poverty guideline for a family of four, but more than twice the poverty level for an individual. Plans show that the development site includes habitats for threatened and endangered species and will add to traffic in the area. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-00448	"Cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/blog-posting/washington-redskins-werent-stranded-police-game/	An online story says the Washington Redskins had an unplanned locker room slumber party. The article’s headline reads, "Cops take a knee then walk out on Redskins, leaving them stranded in their locker room overnight." Clickbait site Universaleinfo posted the story on Aug. 5. It says that Redskins players knelt during the national anthem, angering the police officers providing security at the game. The cops decided to stage a counter-protest: they got down on one knee, yelled "blue lives matter" and then left the team in the locker room. Unable to get past the angry fans outside, the players were stuck all night. The Universaleinfo article was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s a compelling story, aside from the fact none of it happened. The timeline NFL protests have been in the national spotlight since 2016, when Colin Kaepernick, former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, knelt during the anthem to oppose police brutality. Since then, over 200 players throughout the league have chosen to kneel or sit in protest. Protests spiked in September 2017, when President Donald Trump encouraged NFL owners to fire players who didn’t stand for the anthem. Two days after Trump spoke against Kaepernick, some Redskins players knelt before their game. Since then, there have been no reports of Redskins players refusing to stand during the anthem. The Universaleinfo article was posted on Aug. 5, 2018. It says that the Redskins knelt before their game on "Monday night" in Philadelphia. Aug. 5 was a Sunday, so previous Monday would have been six days before, on July 30. The Redskins did not play a game on July 30. In fact, they hadn’t even started pre-season yet. The article also said that the Philadelphia Police Department released a statement after the incident, but there were no recent press releases about the Redskins online. A spokesperson for the Redskins confirmed that there was no game on July 30. As far as we can tell, this article was entirely fabricated. The origin Where did this article come from, if not any actual news sites? It seems to be a repeat of a hoax from October 2017. An identical article was posted on Freedum Junkshun, a satire site meant to anger conservatives. The article is "a boatload of bullhonkey," according to the disclaimer at the bottom of the Freedum Junkshun page. The related articles linked on the page are more of the same: football teams across the country, being punished in creative ways for not standing during the anthem.

pomt-06671	Says Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin ranks "as the most liberal member of the House."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/	Until U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced her 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate, her campaign website displayed a 2006 news article that began with the words: "Rep. Tammy Baldwin, one of the most liberal members of Congress." Evidently, Baldwin’s congressional re-election campaign wasn’t concerned about the candidate being cast as one of the most left-wing members of the U.S. House. Certainly Baldwin’s critics aren’t shy about portraying her in that way. On Sept. 6, 2011, the day Baldwin announced her run for the seat being vacated by Democrat Herb Kohl, Republican Tommy Thompson’s team weighed in. Darrin Schmitz, a consultant to the former Wisconsin governor and likely Senate candidate, issued a statement that said: "Tammy Baldwin is a classic tax-and-spend liberal, and her ranking as the most liberal member of the House puts her clearly out of the mainstream of Wisconsin voters." So does Baldwin, who has served in the House since 1999, rank as its most liberal member? As evidence, Thompson cited a 2010 ranking of House members by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine and website. Baldwin tied with six other House members for the most liberal. The rankings were based on what the journal judged to be 93 votes taken in 2010 that showed "ideological distinctions between members." The largest number -- 59 votes -- were on economic issues. So in one rating system, seven House members, including Baldwin, were rated the most liberal. Let’s look at other major rankings: American Conservative Union The American Conservative Union says it promotes economic growth through lower taxes and reduced government spending, as well as liberty, personal responsibility, traditional values and national security." The organization said its 2010 rankings were based on 24 votes taken in 2010 that created a "clear ideological distinction" among House members. The American Conservative Union had urged House members to vote, for example, against extending long-term unemployment benefits, for ending moratoriums on offshore drilling and against the repeal of the military don’t ask-don’t tell policy. Baldwin’s rating: Zero on a scale of zero to 100, which the organization called a "perfect liberalism score." That certainly puts Baldwin at the extreme end of the spectrum. But it’s also less of a distinction than it might appear: Baldwin was among 150 House members who received that score. Americans for Democratic Action Americans for Democratic Action is an organization that says it is "committed to liberal politics, liberal policies and a liberal future." It ranks lawmakers based on their votes on what the group considers the 20 most important votes of the year. In 2010, the group urged House members to vote for measures such as health care reform, the extension of long-term unemployment benefits and repeal of don’t ask-don’t tell. Baldwin’s liberal rating on the 2010 list: 100 percent. Again, this ranking marks Baldwin as an extreme liberal, but it didn’t exactly single her out. Baldwin was among 49 House members who received a perfect score. Voteview.com Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists, uses a complicated calculation based on patterns of how often each member of Congress votes with other members, and then plots them on a liberal-conservative spectrum. Voteview is different in that members are ranked based on the entire time they have served in the House. Voteview’s latest rankings are for the 111th Congress -- members who served during the 2009-2010 session. Baldwin’s ranking: 19th most liberal. (Note: After our item was posted, researchers with the group were able to pull out just the votes from the most recent session. Based on those votes, Baldwin would be tied for 12th most liberal.) Asked about Thompson’s attack, Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak dismissed the various rankings as "just one group or organization's opinion based on its own selected criteria." He also cited four votes that he said show Baldwin supports the middle class. But four votes don’t go far in refuting the claim and the issue wasn’t whether Baldwin supported the middle class. Our conclusion Thompson says Baldwin, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2012, ranks "as the most liberal member" of the House of Representatives. He singled her out as being more liberal than any of the other 434 members. One ranking puts Baldwin as the 19th most liberal. But that ranking covers her entire House career, and Thompson’s claim refers to the present. Three other major rankings -- one liberal, one conservative and one nonpartisan -- all ranked Baldwin as being among a group of House members considered the most liberal in 2010, the most recent period available. But she was not singled out as being the most liberal in any of the rankings. We rate Thompson’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02605	Deer baiting, planned for Block Island by DEM, is illegal in Rhode Island.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/26/richard-august/gun-commentator-says-technique-rhode-island-plans-/	Nothing gets under people's skin like the government engaging in activity that is illegal for everyone else, such as when Congress passes laws and then exempts itself from them. On Jan. 12, 2014, in a letter to The Providence Journal, Richard August, co-host of the WHJJ radio show "Lock, Stock and Daria," asserted that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management would be doing exactly that if it carries out its plan to hire professional hunters to cull the deer population on Block Island. According to the plan, the hunters would use feeding stations to lure the deer. "Baiting deer happens to be illegal in Rhode Island," August wrote. "But I guess if you are the state, the laws don’t apply." We wondered what the law actually said. First, some background. Block Island, officially known as New Shoreham, is overrun by deer -- an estimated 800 to 1,000 on the 9.5-square mile island. The town and the DEM have agreed on a plan to hire a Connecticut firm to reduce the population to 150 or fewer over the next four years. Corn bait will be used to lure deer to 15 to 20 sites on the southwestern part of the island. Sharpshooters perched on raised platforms will shoot the deer. Their goal for this winter is to kill about 200, beginning in the last week of February. The carcasses will be carved into venison using a mobile meat processing service based in Maine. The meat will be offered first to Block Island residents; the rest will be distributed to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank and other hunger programs. Going back to August's claim, the "Deer Hunting" section of state law says the DEM can adopt rules and regulations on deer hunting in Rhode Island but, "In any event, the following prohibitions and restrictions shall always apply to deer hunting:" Paragraph 6 says, "No person shall make, set, or use any trap or snare, or salt lick or other device for the purpose of ensnaring, enticing, taking, injuring, or killing a deer." When we asked the DEM about this, the department released a statement through spokeswoman Gail Mastrati saying that the rule only applies to "recreational hunting." That's not what the DEM would be doing, she said. "The bait and shoot deer reduction project on Block Island, authorized under emergency regulations filed by DEM on Nov. 7, 2013, to address a serious problem on the island, is not a recreational hunting activity," her statement said. "A bait and shoot deer reduction effort is very different from recreational hunting. The knowledge of animal behavior and the discipline and skills in marksmanship are more sophisticated and strategic than those necessary to be a successful recreational deer hunter." The "deer hunting" section of state law does not make any distinction between recreational and non-recreational hunting. We asked the DEM about that. The department responded in an email: "Hunting regulations do not apply to the deer culling operation because it is not a hunting activity. Rather, it is a wildlife management action authorized under DEM's statutory authority." We'll leave it up to others to debate whether the culling of the island’s deer herd is really a hunt and, if so, whether the state’s hunting laws should apply to the DEM. (We should note, for example, that most of us have no problem with agents of the state, such as police officers, ignoring traffic signals or speed limits when chasing criminals.) But when Richard August asserts that state law makes it illegal for hunters to use bait to lure deer, which is what the DEM plans to do when it stages a mass shooting of deer, he is correct. We rate the claim True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-05514	"[O]ver 200,000 ordinary citizens were given the opportunity to identify projects they preferred."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/13/metro-atlanta-voter-education-network/group-200000-given-chance-sound-tax/	A new mailer about a referendum to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta makes it appear as if voters had a hand in this plan to raise their taxes. Voters will decide July 31 whether they want to pay a 1 percent sales tax to build an estimated $7.2 billion worth of roads, highway interchanges, mass transit infrastructure and other projects to ease traffic in a region that’s choking on it. More than two dozen local leaders spent months hammering out that list of projects through state-created regional roundtables. The mailer, which appeared in a PolitiFact Georgia reporter’s home mailbox April 3, said the average Joe had a say, too. "[O]ver 200,000 ordinary citizens were given the opportunity to identify projects they preferred," it said. It’s enough to make a populist swoon. But 200,000 people? Is that even possible? PolitiFact Georgia called up the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, which sent out the mailer on the proposed transportation special local option tax, or T-SPLOST. The nonprofit’s mission is to educate voters about the referendum. A MAVEN spokeswoman said the Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning agency, contacted 1.3 million residents last year for telephone town hall meetings about the plan. Part of ARC’s mission is public outreach, so it regularly tallies the number of residents it involves, spokeswoman Julie Ralston said. Our research shows ARC has a track record for doing so. It counted residents who participated in Plan 2040, which identified transportation projects the region will need in the next three decades. It posted numbers on the project’s website. T-SPLOST’s website, news accounts and ARC news releases chronicle the series of 10 evening telephone town hall meetings in June. ARC contracted with Telephone TownHall Meeting, a Denver-area company that uses Web and telephone technology to hold virtual meetings. Members of Congress often use the meetings to connect with voters back home. Telephone TownHall Meeting owner Curt Cerveny told us how the meetings typically work: The company calls tens of thousands of land lines and cellphones for their target households. Some numbers don’t work. Others send the call to voicemail or a fax machine. Sometimes, people hang up. About 15 percent to 20 percent of the time, someone picks up and listens in for at least one minute, Cerveny said. Usually, listeners spend eight to 10 minutes on the line. The T-SPLOST town halls attempted to reach 1.3 million registered voters, an ARC report said. The town halls took place by county. "It was the biggest call we had ever done," Cerveny said. "It was kind of ahead of its time." Some 134,400 households participated. They stayed on the line for an average of 10.59 minutes. Presenters took 213 live questions. (This PolitiFact Georgia scribe received one of those calls on her cellphone. She was in her car, stuck in gridlock.) This number does not include calls that went to voicemail. These households received messages telling voters how they can have a say in the project. The report did not state the number of listeners per call. This amounts to about 10 percent participation, or slightly less than what Cerveny said was typical. ARC launched other outreach efforts. In March and April 2011, 126 residents of the affected counties participated in a series of 12 focus groups. In July, about 200 attended a 3 ½-hour town hall meeting. In September, 12 public meetings were attended by about 1,700 people, according to ARC meeting notes. An online survey generated 9,600 responses. Interested residents could also consult the project’s website, www.atlantaregionalroundtable.com. Local governments and private organizations also conducted their own outreach. ARC collaborated with more than 80 of them to get the word out, Ralston said. One is the Livable Communities Coalition, an Atlanta nonprofit that works on regional growth strategies. A "very conservative" estimate is that its efforts reached 5,000 people, said Jim Stokes, the group’s interim executive director. To conclude: Since ARC tried to reach 1.3 million people through its telephone town halls and managed to get about 10 percent of them, we think it’s safe to say that more than 200,000 were "given the opportunity" to participate. In addition, some 20,000 participated in meetings, online surveys and other outreach efforts organized by the planning agency. Local governments and other organizations performed outreach as well. This is a lot of "ordinary citizens," but their influence had limits. The decision rested with the regional roundtable. Members could accept -- or ignore -- public comments as they saw fit. That said, MAVEN’s mailer stopped short of saying that these voters controlled the process. Furthermore, its participation estimate is conservative. Its statement earns our highest rating -- True.

pomt-10956	"[The] unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/jul/23/mike-pence/record-low-unemployment-philly-area-pence-right-so/	Vice President Mike Pence is in Philadelphia on Monday to speak about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and attend a fundraiser for U.S. Senate candidate Lou Barletta. Protesters are expected to greet him, as they did during an earlier visit this year. Ahead of his trip, Pence published an opinion piece in the Philadelphia Inquirer that declared the Trump administration’s policies are benefitting Pennsylvania: "Our agenda is delivering real results – and we’re just getting started." Among the "real results" touted by Pence? That "the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded." As jobs will likely be a major talking point during the midterm elections in Pennsylvania, we decided to check that statement. Most experts agree that presidents have little control over the economy. In his piece, Pence uses the unemployment rate for the Philadelphia area to bolster his argument that the Trump administration’s policies are benefiting the city. But presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change. Experts also debate whether the unemployment rate is a meaningful indicator of the economy’s well-being. That probably rings true for the 48 percent of city residents living below the poverty line or for those who have stopped looking for work. But for the purposes of this fact-check, we stuck with the numbers. "Based on data from the Philadelphia Metropolitan Division, the unemployment rate (4.7%) in May 2018 was the lowest ever recorded," the vice president’s spokesperson, Alyssa Farah, said via email when asked about the source of the claim. Unemployment data comes from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division is a subset of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD metropolitan statistical area and includes both Philadelphia and Delaware counties. BLS releases both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted Local Area Unemployment Statistics. The Pa. Department of Labor & Industry uses seasonally adjusted data, as it allows for month-to-month comparisons and accounts for trends like layoffs after the holiday season, analyst Jeff Newman told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. For the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in May, according to BLS. That number is preliminary and will be finalized within a month, Newman said. That 4.7 percent rate is the lowest number on record since January 1990. That’s as far back as BLS went when it reconstructed unemployment data based on MSA and metro division delineation changes that happened after the last census. Pence’s claim would not be true using non-seasonally adjusted unemployment data. The unadjusted unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in May, according to BLS, and was lower in April 2000 (4.3 percent). Our ruling Ahead of his visit to Philadelphia, Vice President Mike Pence claimed in an opinion piece that the unemployment rate for the city’s metro area is the lowest on record. That is true only if one looks at seasonally adjusted unemployment data for the Philadelphia, PA Metropolitan Division (which includes Delaware County) since 1990, which is important context. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2018-07-23T13:00:00	2018-07-22	['Philadelphia']
pomt-02801	"The recidivism rate is nearly 29 percent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being released from Guantanamo."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/02/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-statement-partially-true-needs-context/	U.S. senators fighting to close Guantanamo Bay won a small victory late last month despite opposition from their colleague Saxby Chambliss. Senate Democrats joined forces with a handful of Republicans to successfully defend their bid to ease restrictions on transferring detainees out of the controversial military prison. The changes have yet to clear Congress. But the victory may be a sign that support for closing Guantanamo is growing. \Chambliss, who opposes current efforts to close Guantanamo, warned during a Senate floor debate that the proposed changes could free terrorists to strike again. "These are not abstract theories; they are facts. The recidivism rate is nearly 29 percent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being released from Guantanamo," the Georgia Republican said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to unleash the AJC Truth-O-Meter to determine whether those really are the "facts." The proposal to alter detainee transfer rules is part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which would provide defense funding. Chambliss, who is vice chairman of the Senate’s Select Committee on Intelligence, co-sponsored a failed amendment that would have prevented the changes. How many former detainees have returned to terrorism is a central issue in the Guantanamo debate. A low recidivism rate could breathe life into President Barack Obama’s attempt to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. (We gave him a Promise Broken rating on the Obameter in August.) A high rate could kill it. But tracking former Guantanamo detainees isn’t as easy as counting prisoners released from a state penitentiary. The calculation relies on intelligence that the government keeps classified. Critics complain that the figures are impossible to verify because the names of re-offenders are not released. A few may have been branded as recidivists for merely criticizing the U.S. Some former prisoners may never have been terrorists in the first place, they say. A semiannual report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence addresses some of these criticisms by giving more precise descriptions for what counts as returning to terrorism. When an ex-detainee is "confirmed of re-engaging" in terrorism or insurgency, intelligence gatherers have found a "preponderance of information" showing the former prisoner is directly involved in activities such as planning attacks, financing operations or recruiting for terrorist groups. The group does not include those who only make anti-U.S. statements or call other former prisoners to talk about old times. When an ex-detainee is "suspected of re-engaging," intelligence gatherers have "plausible but unverified" evidence or "single-source reporting" showing the former prisoner is directly involved. According to the latest ODNI report, which was released in September, 100 of 603 released detainees were "confirmed of re-engaging," or about 16.6 percent. An additional 74, or 12.3 percent, were "suspected of re-engaging." Add them together and you get 28.9 percent, or "nearly 29 percent," as Chambliss said. As part of our assessment of the senator’s statement, we also considered whether the number of "re-engaging" ex-detainees is "climbing steadily." During the George W. Bush years, 532 detainees were released, according to the report. Of those, 97 were "confirmed of re-engaging," while 70 were suspected of it. Under Obama, 71 detainees were released. Three were confirmed as returning to terrorism. Four are suspected. In other words, the total number has increased under Obama, but his percentage is lower than the Bush administration’s. So, did Chambliss get it right? A spokeswoman for Chambliss says it’s common to combine the categories because ex-detainees often switch from the "suspected" to "confirmed" designation. Also, she says, intelligence gatherers have to detect some level of terrorist activity before it classifies someone as "suspected." But The Washington Post pointed out that when Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess Jr., then the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress in February 2011, he corrected Chambliss when the senator used a recidivism figure that combined the classifications. Burgess said the figure "would not be confirmed by the Defense Intelligence Agency in terms of having returned to the fight or re-engaged." In addition, the ODNI report makes clear that ex-detainees classified as "suspected of re-engaging" may not have done so. Chambliss’ decision to combine them with confirmed terrorists gives the impression that the data support his argument more forcefully than it actually does. Chambliss’ assessment that the rate of recidivists is "climbing steadily" also has some weaknesses. The number of suspected or confirmed recidivists has grown by a half-dozen or so since Obama took office, but his percentage is lower than that of the Bush administration. PolitiFact’s definition of "Half True" means that a statement is at least partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think Chambliss’ claim fits the bill. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2013-12-02T06:00:00	2013-11-19	['None']

But this is an uncorroborated quote that has been floating around the internet for years. "Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business," said a February 2017 headline from My Christian Daily, which circulated social media last week. My Christian Daily is a project from Initiate Media, a Christian media company that "seek(s) to make God famous," according to its "About" page. Similar stories have appeared on various websites since 2013. My Christian Daily cited an article from the Washington Press — a website that we were unable to find and may no longer exist — as well as an article from Forbes. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story about Schultz said that during a 2013 annual meeting for Starbucks shareholders, Schultz received a complaint from Tom Strobhar, founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center, an organization with a mission to "challenge companies that offend traditional moral norms" such as "the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman." Strobhar said he believed Starbucks lost revenue because of its public support for a 2012 same-sex marriage referendum, which in turn inspired boycotts from anti-gay-marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage. The referendum asked voters if same-sex marriage should be legalized in the state of Washington, and Starbucks joined other leading Washington-area companies in supporting the measure. In response, the story went, Schultz told Strobhar to sell his Starbucks shares and invest in other companies. As it turns out, Schultz’s actual remarks were more nuanced, and we did not find any credible articles that quoted him saying he did not want business from opponents of same-sex marriage. Snopes debunked this falsehood years ago and updated its post on Sunday. Schultz said at the time that the decision to support same-sex marriage was about respecting diversity rather than maximizing revenue. "Not every decision is an economic decision," Schultz said. "Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months." He continued: "Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds. If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company." Schultz’s 38 percent figure comes from fiscal year 2012, meaning the timeframe between October 2011 to September 2012. This return was down from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 46 percent shareholder return. (See a video of Schultz’s full response.) When the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Starbucks issued a statement applauding the decision and recalling Schultz’s exchange with Strobhar as "the company’s most vocal statement on diversity and equality." Reggie Borges, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said the My Christian Daily story is not accurate and pointed to the Snopes fact-check, a video of Schultz’s response and the statement released after 2015 Supreme Court ruling as evidence. My Christian Daily did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A headline stated, "Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business.’" This is a claim that has circulated since 2013. At an annual meeting for company shareholders, Strobhar said the company’s support for same-sex marriage was eroding its bottom line, which prompted Schultz to defend his decision. Schultz said Strobhar was free to sell his Starbucks stocks and invest in another company if he believed the company’s social policies meant he could get a better return on his money elsewhere. He did not say opponents of same-sex marriage were not wanted as investors or as customers. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12790	New York state subsidizes private colleges "probably more than any other state except maybe one."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/feb/16/andrew-cuomo/new-york-gives-more-aid-private-college-students-a/	New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed free college tuition for resident students in families that earn $125,000 or less a year -- but only at the state’s public colleges and universities. Private colleges worry about their enrollment and finances if the plan passes. It wouldn’t be an even playing field, the private colleges say. Cuomo fired back at the critics at a Buffalo rally to promote his idea. "We happen to subsidize private colleges probably more than any other state except maybe one," Cuomo said. Is Cuomo right? State tuition aid The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which tracks college financial aid, said New York state provided $253 million in need-based grants to students attending not-for-profit private colleges in the state. That’s how much the state gave in the 2014-2015 school year, the most-recent available year for data. Only Texas offered more, giving private college students $289 million in all. Need-based grant programs vary widely among states, making it hard to rank per capita spending by state. Overall aid per student is difficult to track because students in some states can take advantage of multiple aid programs. So while it's possible to know how many students benefited from an individual program, no one keeps track nationally how much individual students receive from multiple programs. Other states give more to individual students. The maximum award from New York state’s Tuition Assistance Program is $5,165 a year. Students in California could be eligible to receive more than double that amount. New York state’s average need-based award for private college students -- $3,200 -- is also lower than in other large states. Private college students in California receive about $8,500 on average. But New York state has more aid recipients than other states. The latest data shows nearly 79,000 private college students in New York state take advantage of the need-based TAP aid, while only about 28,000 are given comparable aid in California. Percentage of state aid Despite New York's No. 2 ranking in total aid, 15 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., allocate a higher percentage of their total need-based aid to private college students. Two-thirds of New York's need-based grant aid goes to public college students. Iowa gives 80 percent of need-based grants to students at not-for-profit private colleges. What about merit aid? On a different kind of college assistance -- merit aid -- New York ranks first in awarding $5.5 million to private college students. About 52 percent of the total merit aid went to private college students. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state subsidizes private colleges "probably more than any other state except maybe one." Data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs shows New York state ranks second behind Texas in dollar amount of aid given to private school students. We rate this claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f547ed7-141f-4771-8d7e-df2095b52f90	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2017-02-16T17:22:37	2017-02-07	['None']
pomt-02302	Wisconsin is "one of the bluest" states, but under Scott Walker its unemployment rate "is around 3.5%."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/02/rush-limbaugh/wisconsin-heavily-democratic-state-and-yet-under-s/	Rush Limbaugh was noting with amazement that the New York Times had carried an item about the Wisconsin Legislature approving a $504 million tax cut proposed by Gov. Scott Walker. "I think this is one of the biggest and most under-commented on -- including in conservative media -- stories this year," Limbaugh said on his show on March 19, 2014, according to a transcript on his website. "This is simply huge, what Governor Walker has done, no matter how you look at this." The nation's highest-rated radio talk show host continued by making a claim about how Democratic-leaning Wisconsin is and how low unemployment is under the Republican governor. Wisconsin, Limbaugh said, is "one of the bluest of blue states. One of the bluest of the blue universities. One of the headquarter states for malcontent state unions. One of the headquarter states for malcontent Democrat Party union activism. They did everything they could not just to destroy Walker's political career; they tried to destroy his reputation and his political life. They attempted to recall him a couple of times. The Democrats in the Senate walked out. "He persevered. He overcame. He dominated, and he won. And in the bluest of blue states, unemployment is around 3.5 percent." Leaving aside Limbaugh’s reference to a couple of recalls (Walker prevailed in the one recall attempt, in 2012, made against him), many Wisconsinites likely regard their state as being roughly as much red (Republican) as it is blue (Democratic). And they, along with Limbaugh’s millions of other listeners, might be surprised that unemployment has gotten so low. Blue, red and purple The Washington Post traces the widespread use of red and blue to the late "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert and an appearance he made on "The Today Show" about a week before George W. Bush’s victory over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. Russert and host Matt Lauer discussed a map that had a red-and-blue color scheme. Up to then, there had been no consensus and some media identified Democratic states as red and Republican states as blue. How states vote for president, in the most recent election or the last several presidential contests, has become a common way to identify states as blue or red. Viewed narrowly, Wisconsin is blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee in each of the last seven presidential contests. Over the past five decades, only two Republicans, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have won Wisconsin. (Nixon won in 1960, 1968 and 1972, and Reagan won in 1980 and 1984). Limbaugh spokeswoman Rachel Nelson said Limbaugh based the blue-state part of his claim on the fact that Wisconsin hadn’t voted for the GOP presidential nominee since ‘84. But calling Wisconsin "one of the bluest" states suggests it’s an automatic in the Democratic column, when in fact it has often been a presidential battleground. Four months before the 2012 election, for example, Politico listed Wisconsin as one of nine swing states; days before the vote, the New York Times listed Wisconsin as one of just six swing states. And on other measures, Wisconsin isn’t clearly blue at all. In terms of control of state government, Wisconsin’s hue is red, with Walker as governor and the GOP in control of both houses of the Legislature. Accordingly, The Post in December 2013 colored Wisconsin red in observing how states are aligning completely with one party -- three-quarters of them are now controlled by either Republicans or Democrats. It’s worth nothing, however, that things can change quickly in Wisconsin. Just prior to the 2010 elections, which put Walker and his fellow Republicans in power, Wisconsin state government was blue, with a Democrat as governor (Jim Doyle didn’t seek re-election) and Democrats controlling the Legislature. Meanwhile, Wisconsin looks purple -- as in a mix of blue and red -- when it comes to federal representatives and party preferences. In the U.S. Senate, conservative Republican Ron Johnson and liberal Democrat Tammy Baldwin are about as far apart politically as any state's senators. Wisconsin’s House delegation is closely split, with five Republicans and three Democrats. As for party preferences, a yearlong annual Gallup poll released in January 2014 identified 17 states as blue, meaning their residents were solidly or leaning Democratic; and 14 as red, as in solidly or leaning Republican. That left 19 states, including Wisconsin, rated as competitive. In sum, Wisconsin doesn’t measure up as one the bluest states. Unemployment down, but not that low On the 3.5 percent unemployment part of his claim, Limbaugh misspoke, his spokeswoman said. She noted Limbaugh had also referenced the Dakotas during that part of his show. (In January 2014, the latest rates available when Limbaugh made his statement, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in South Dakota and 2.6 percent in North Dakota.) Two weeks before Limbaugh made his statement, we evaluated a claim by Democrat Mary Burke, Walker's challenger in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. We gave her a Pants on Fire for claiming that unemployment under Walker is up. Although Walker is not on pace to meet his campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs by January 2015, unemployment has dropped from 7.7 percent when he took office in January 2011 to near 6 percent. It was 6.1 percent in January 2014. Wisconsin’s unemployment rate last hit 3.5 percent in November 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Limbaugh said Wisconsin is "one of the bluest" states, but under Walker its unemployment rate "is around 3.5%." Although Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last seven presidential contests, as a frequent battleground state, it is far from being an automatic in the Democratic column. At the state level, meanwhile, Wisconsin is currently Republican red but was recently Democratic blue, and by other measures it is somewhere between the two. As for unemployment under Walker, it has dropped to near 6 percent, but nowhere near 3.5 percent. We rate Limbaugh’s statement False.

pomt-00046	Says Marshall Tuck "is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor" pictured as Betsy DeVos.	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/05/tony-thurmond/ad-wrongly-implies-marshall-tuck-backed-betsy-devo/	An attack ad in the race to be California’s next schools chief strongly suggests candidate Marshall Tuck is "backed" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a polarizing Trump administration appointee. Tuck is a Democrat and former education executive. He’s running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction against State Asm. Tony Thurmond, also a Democrat, whose campaign produced the ad. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. Here’s what the ad claims, as a photo of President Trump standing next to DeVos appears on the screen and then zooms in on DeVos. "Tuck is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor and financed by the same billionaires behind Betsy DeVos." Ad by Tony Thurmond campaign Both Tuck and DeVos support charter schools. Meanwhile, Thurmond is a strong advocate for public schools. Tuck has said he supports nonprofit charter schools in areas with few quality public school alternatives, though he wants to implement some changes. According to his website, he wants to make for-profit charter schools illegal, require greater school transparency and open charter schools to all students. But we wanted to know whether DeVos really supports Tuck in the race, as the ad suggests. Our research DeVos’ office did not respond to our requests for comment. We asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim. Instead of providing evidence that DeVos supports Tuck, they said he’s backed by Bill Evers. Evers is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who specializes in education policy. He was also "head of the ‘agency action team’ for the U.S. Department of Education in the Trump transition from early September 2016 through January 2017," according to his biography. In June, Evers posted a pro-Tuck campaign ad on Facebook and supported Tuck four years ago in his run for the same office. He’s not, however, on the long list of supporters on Tuck’s website. A spokesman for Tuck's campaign said Evers probably supports Tuck but hasn't made any financial contributions. Tuck's website includes a news article by the Independent Voter Network website that refers to Evers as a supporter of Tuck. Evers did not respond to a request for comment. Perhaps more importantly, the ad never mentions Evers’ name or shows his photo. Its primary focus is on DeVos. A spokesman for the Tuck campaign called the claim "a false and misleading attack by Tony Thurmond." He pointed to examples of Tuck criticizing DeVos. "I’d rate Betsy DeVos extremely low. I think she is not qualified really for that job," Tuck said in a video posted in March by the news website gvwire.com. "I’ve been very clear: My agenda is strongly against the Trump/DeVos agenda," he added at a campaign forum in May. Our ruling State Asm. Tony Thurmond, a candidate for California schools chief, left the strong impression in a recent ad that his opponent, Marshall Tuck, "is backed" by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The ad zooms in on a photo of DeVos as it says Tuck "is backed by Donald Trump’s education advisor." But Tuck has criticized DeVos and the Thurmond campaign offered no evidence she supports Tuck. They did say that Bill Evers, who advised Trump on education during his transition, supports Tuck. But he’s not mentioned by name or shown in the ad, and Tuck doesn’t list him as a supporter on his website. In the end, we agreed the ad is misleading. It gives the impression DeVos supports Tuck. But there’s zero evidence to back that up. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: We have updated our fact check to show that Tuck's website includes a news article by the Independent Voter Network website that refers to Evers as a supporter of Tuck.

pomt-04614	"Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-50-percent-kids-coming-out-school/	Secretly recorded video of Mitt Romney grabbed attention on Sept. 17, 2012, primarily for his claim that 47 percent of Americans "believe they are victims" entitled to government help. But there’s more to the video snippets of Romney speaking privately to big Florida donors in Boca Raton. As the Republican presidential candidate explained his approach to wooing independent voters, he reeled off a series of statistics about the disappointing economy. "The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won't graduate from high school. What're they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, ‘Yeah, I think you're right.’" We’re checking several statements from Romney’s remarks on May 17, 2012, but here we’re asking whether, "Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job." Fifty percent of kids Romney has made similar remarks on the campaign trail before, and his campaign has pointed us to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates. The key piece of evidence is from the Associated Press article, "In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed." It’s based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. Here’s how the AP summarized the findings: "A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ... "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year." Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed, and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree. In August, PolitiFact checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis. Romney would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim the way he did on other occasions, when he said "half the kids coming out of college this year … can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree." We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities. According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- "before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields." That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets. While Romney glossed over details when he spoke with donors, painting a darker picture than supported by the research, he did get the tone right: At 53.6 percent, the number of college graduates unemployed or underemployed is the highest it’s been in at least 11 years. Our ruling Romney told campaign donors that "50 percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job." He missed a key qualifier -- according to the research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can’t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn’t require a college degree. Still, the research shows the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02674	The Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/09/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-claims-florida-group-backs-drug-test/	PunditFact isn't always the first to weigh in on the tit-for-tat of cable news shows, in part because the nature of our work requires more than claims and counterclaims. And sometimes, a few extra days allows matters to become more settled. Such is the case in examining the back-and-forth recently between MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and representatives for Charles and David Koch. You probably have heard the story by now, but here's a quick catch-up. On Maddow's Jan. 2, 2014, show, Maddow accused the Koch brothers -- through "affiliated state groups" -- of pushing and promoting a Florida law that requires welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Representatives for the Koch brothers pushed back against the allegation, saying they were not involved with the Florida law or the Florida group who supported the law, the Foundation for Government Accountability. Maddow is sticking by her story and refused to read a Koch-prepared on-air apology. In her original report, Maddow said that Koch brothers affiliated groups "in Florida they, at least, have been promoting forced drug tests for people who are on welfare." Later after Maddow read a description of the same group, the Foundation for Government Accountability, she said, "That’s the Koch brothers group that has been promoting this idea, right, the same Koch brothers group that has been telling people not to get health insurance. They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds." We're boiling down those comments to fact-check this statement: The Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." The Koch brothers and their money The Koch brothers, Charles and David, inherited their father's Koch Industries, an oil refinery business that has since expanded into energy, textiles and manufacturing. Koch subsidiaries make Quilted Northern tissue paper, Dixie cups and Stainmaster carpet, among other products. Forbes estimates the brothers to have a combined wealth of $72 billion. And they spend it. An examination by the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post found that the Kochs' political groups raised more than $400 million for political causes during the 2012 election. The Kochs are rich, shrewd and conservative, and they have helped create a labyrinth of political groups and funding sources with names like the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Center to Protect Patient Rights, Public Notice, Americans for Prosperity, and Generation Opportunity. They fought the re-election of President Barack Obama and continue to fight the health care law. As a result, the Kochs have become a leading target of liberals and Maddow’s bête noire. Their tentacles are many places, to be sure, but how deeply do they reach into the Foundation for Government Accountability and a Florida law to require drug tests of welfare recipients? Florida's drug-testing law Let’s start with Florida’s drug-testing law. The law, which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge Dec. 31, 2013, required people applying for welfare benefits to first pass a drug screening. The idea, in Florida, started with Gov. Rick Scott. While campaigning in the Republican primary for governor in 2010, Scott unveiled a seven-step plan to create 700,000 private-sector jobs over seven years. As part of that umbrella promise, Scott also pledged to save the state $77 million in part by adding a drug-testing requirement for welfare. The idea was born when Scott was still an underdog to then-Attorney General Bill McCollum and did not come from the Kochs or the Foundation for Government Accountability, said Mary Anne Carter, a senior campaign adviser who helped craft Scott’s policy plan. The idea came from other states, Carter said. Arizona passed a law to drug test welfare recipients in 2009. Michigan passed the first such law in 1999, but a federal appellate court struck it down in 2003. And in 1996, amid federal welfare reform, St. Johns County in northeast Florida approved a policy to test applicants of county assistance for some medical services. The New York Times found at least 29 states debated the measures in 2013, though just a couple passed. "This is an issue that has been around at least a decade," Carter told PunditFact. Scott and the Kochs do have some connections. In June 2011, Scott attended a retreat hosted by the Koch brothers near Vail, Colo., where he says he discussed the drug-testing plan. "It was very interesting," Scott said of the meeting. "They wanted basically to know what am I doing in Florida." And in 2013, Scott gave a keynote address at an Americans for Prosperity Foundation summit in Orlando. The Americans for Prosperity Foundation is affiliated with Americans for Prosperity. Americans for Prosperity was founded by Koch. The Foundation for Government Accountability So that's the origin of the law in Florida, but what about the group Maddow says is Koch affiliated -- the Foundation for Government Accountability? The foundation is a conservative think tank that incorporated in Naples in late June 2011, one month after Scott signed the drug-testing law. It clearly supported the drug-testing law after it passed. One of its pamphlets was cited by the state in defense of the drug-testing requirement and the foundation promoted the law at a conference of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in December 2011. During her show, Maddow didn't explain how she determined that the Foundation for Government Accountability is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." Lauren Skowronski, an MSNBC spokeswoman, told us the crux of Maddow's argument relates not to the Foundation for Government Accountability but to another group called the State Policy Network. Maddow says the State Policy Network received money from Koch, and in turn the State Policy Network gave money to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo Koch money went to the Foundation for Government Accountability. Ergo the Foundation for Government Accountability is a Koch affiliate. "The Kochs have funded an umbrella organization which disbursed money for the start-up of (the Foundation for Government Accountability) in 2011. That umbrella organization is the State Policy Network," Skowronski said. For its part, the Foundation for Government Accountability notes the foundation did not exist until after the drug-testing law was passed, and its leaders did not communicate with Koch officials or their intermediaries about the law. (That fact significantly colors Maddow's assertion that, "They're the ones that came up with the idea that it’s a great use of state funds.") "We did not work with Koch on the Florida welfare drug-testing issue," foundation CEO Tarren Bragdon said. "To the best of my knowledge, Koch wasn't involved at all. I have never heard anyone involved in the issue in any capacity mention Koch or reference their engagement or financial support." As with Scott, however, there are some connections between Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. The Tampa Bay Times reported in 2012 that the foundation supported Scott’s drug-test law, and Bragdon had touted a similar drug-test policy in Maine. The Times wrote that Bragdon said the Kochs had not donated to his foundation, but that people with connections to Koch have, including Robert A. Levy and the Atlas Research Foundation. Levy is the chairman of the Cato Institute, which was co-founded by Charles Koch. But the more important tie is between the Foundation for Government Accountability and the State Policy Network. The State Policy Network gave the Foundation for Government Accountability $60,000 in 2011 "for start-up, direct mail prospecting," and $108,150 in 2012 for "general operating and health care policy research," tax filings show. The contributions equal about 28 percent of what the Foundation for Government Accountability received in 2011 and about 15 percent in 2012. So what’s the connection between Koch and the State Policy Network? Mark Holden, an attorney for Koch Industries, told PunditFact that various Koch foundations gave $40,000 to the State Policy Network between 2002 and 2012. But Holden says Koch foundations have no connections to the Foundation for Government Accountability, Other Koch money also could be at play. How much is hard to say. The Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal group, published a report about the State Policy Network in November. The report attempts to track the money of various corporations and entities -- including those connected to Koch -- using publicly available tax forms over several years, cross-referencing third-party reporting. Interestingly, the report also lists Comcast as a donor to the State Policy Network. Comcast is the parent company of Maddow's MSNBC. We read the Center for Media and Democracy analysis and then conducted our own. The result, like the reporting from the Center for Responsive Politics and the Washington Post, shows the complex network in which the Kochs' distribute their money. In 2008 and 2010, a not-for-profit called the Knowledge and Progress Fund donated $3.24 million to another not-for-profit called Donors Trust, tax forms show. Charles Koch is a director of the Knowledge and Progress Fund. In 2011, Donors Trust made various donations to the State Policy Network. The group also made a $500,000 contribution to another group called Donors Capital Fund, for a "donor-advised fund," tax forms show. We don’t know what the money was for. The president of Donors Trust is a woman named Whitney L. Ball, who previously worked at the Cato Institute (a think tank founded by Charles Koch) and serves on the board of Donors Capital and the State Policy Network. It gets more interesting. Donors Capital Fund gave $1.97 million to State Policy Network in 2011 (2012 records were not immediately available), including $135,000 earmarked for the purpose of "start-up activities in Florida." That was the same year the foundation started. Donors Capital Fund also gave almost $300,000 in 2010 to Bragdon’s then-Maine Heritage Policy Center for various purposes. Does "start-up activities in Florida" mean the Foundation for Government Accountability? We don’t know for certain. If it does, could you directly link that money back to the Koch-controlled Knowledge and Progress Fund? We could not. Holden, the Koch Industries attorney, told us he didn’t know the purpose of the donations of either Donors Trust or Knowledge and Progress Fund. "We've got a long long list of other groups David and Charles supported," Holden said, naming the Smithsonian, Johns Hopkins and the Salvation Army. "Are they ‘Koch-connected?’ As far as the FGA group (Foundation for Government Accountability) we have no involvement. We did not give them any money. We are not connected with them. We have nothing to do with them." A tenuous connection It's easy to find connections between people and groups; "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" taught us that. And certainly with people like Charles and David Koch, who have billions of dollars and spend it on a variety of conservative political causes, it’s even easier. But in the case of the Foundation for Government Accountability, the ties to Koch are dubious. Part of that may be the fault of the system, which allows donors to largely remain anonymous, and shuttle money through shadow groups. Maddow suggested as much in a follow-up segment detailing the Koch controversy. "The Foundation for Government Accountability is part of a huge network of state-based conservative think-tanks that is frankly kind of designed to not look like a network. They all look vaguely indigenous. They all have what look to be locally specific names," Maddow said on Jan. 3. "But their funding if you follow it comes in part from a central source of big money corporate donors. Including groups affiliated with the Koch brothers." Yet Maddow drew a straight line linking Koch, the Foundation for Government Accountability and the Florida drug-testing law when reality is different. Yes, there are some ties among Scott, Koch and the Foundation for Government Accountability. And yes, there are some slightly stronger interactions between Koch and the State Policy Network. But it's not enough to declare the Foundation for Government Accountability a Koch affiliate. "The Kochs have certainly supported the State Policy Network and some of its think-tank affiliates. But I haven’t seen evidence that they have directly funded the Foundation for Government Accountability or proactively pushed for the drug-testing law," Daniel Schulman, a journalist with Mother Jones who is writing a book about the Kochs, told the Washington Post. "Do they want to rein in entitlements? Absolutely. But in the case of Florida, I think the connection is tenuous." Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame law professor who focuses on nonprofit advocacy issues, told us the Kochs’ network of entities shows that "they have gone to significant lengths and expense to hide their contributions and where those contributions are going," But, "it does seem to be a stretch to say that all of the donors to the State Policy Network are somehow affiliated with Foundation for Government Accountability given the small size of the grant to the foundation compared to all the grants made by the network." Maddow said the Foundation for Government Accountability, which supported a Florida law requiring drug testing of welfare recipients, is a "Koch brothers affiliated group." The evidence to prove that particular claim is thin. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2014-01-09T17:31:29	2014-01-02	['None']
pomt-13928	"Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/cory-booker/sen-cory-booker-says-al-qaida-has-urged-followers-/	New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker was one of the U.S. senators who spent nearly 15 hours in an overnight filibuster designed to pressure Congress to vote on two gun amendments proposed in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. One would block anyone on the government's terrorist watch list from buying a firearm. The other would expand background checks to all gun show purchases and internet sales. Both were rejected in a largely party-line vote June 20, 2016. Ahead of the vote, MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked Booker in a June 16 interview how the filibuster would "lead to an actual bill, something the president can sign?" "Well, what I have been finding recently is how many Americans did not realize that you can be under investigation by the FBI, that you could have been put on the no-fly list because you were considered to be too dangerous to enter plane, but you could still go out and buy a trunk load full of weapons," he said. "And so here we have this real war that we’re on — a war against terrorism. We’re basically telling our enemy, exploit this loophole. In fact, our enemy, al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole to attack and kill Americans.' " We've covered the fact that people on terrorist watch lists have been able to buy firearms. For this fact-check, we decided to look into whether al-Qaida propaganda has actually been urging people to exploit that situation. When we contacted Booker's office, a spokesman responded immediately with several links, all pointing to a 2011 video made by Adam Gadahn, an American serving as a spokesman for al-Qaida. "Muslims in the west have to remember they are perfectly placed to play an important and decisive part in the jihad against the Zionists and crusaders, and to do major damage to the enemies of Islam, waging war on their religion, sacred places, and things and brethren. This is a golden opportunity" to rush to do battle with everything at your disposal, he says. "And in the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let’s take America as an example," Gadahn said. "America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?" (Gadahn's information was not entirely correct. As CNN noted, only specially licensed dealers can sell fully automatic weapons and they require a background check.) Gadahn, the first American charged with treason since World War II and an occupant of the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists, was killed by the United States in January 2015 counterterrorism operation. Max Abrahms, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University, said he couldn't recall "any other videos as explicit about the ease of using guns in the United States on Islamists' behalf. That said, I would be surprised if there isn't other propaganda seeking to exploit the permissiveness of gun access in the U.S." Our ruling Booker said, "Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans." We've seen a 2011 video from one operative, an Al-Qaida spokesman born and raised in America, who did indeed urge Muslims to use the gun show loophole to purchase weapons and attack Americans. While an expert said its reasonable that other pieces of propaganda exist, we don't know of any. With that caveat, we rate the claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/475e31b4-c182-4fd0-9834-ea5d0efad56f	None	Cory Booker	None	None	None	2016-06-23T10:30:00	2016-06-16	['United_States']

The Republican presidential debate in Houston, Texas, on Feb. 25, 2016, opened with a discussion about illegal immigration. Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz sparred over how to deal with people living here illegally and how to secure the southern U.S. border. In the middle of the back-and-forth, Trump made the blanket statement that we wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration if not for him. "If it weren’t for me … (illegal immigration) wouldn’t even be a big subject," Trump said. It’s a line we’ve heard from Trump since at least August. It was False then, and it’s still False now. Back in August, we searched major newspapers for the 51 days before Trump entered the race -- on June 16, 2015 -- and the 51 days after Trump’s announcement. We looked for the terms "undocumented" and "illegal immigrant" within 10 words of the word "president." The results? The subject of illegal immigration certainly was a subject pre-Trump, and post-Trump. Date range Search term Number of articles April 25 to June 15 Undocumented 65 June 16 to Aug. 6 Undocumented 42 April 25 to June 15 Illegal immigrant 60 June 16 to Aug. 6 Illegal immigrant 79 Source: Lexis-Nexis Anecdotally, Cruz certainly has made illegal immigration a subject of his campaign. In Cruz’s announcement speech for president March 23, 2015, Cruz said, "Instead of the lawlessness and the president’s unconstitutional executive amnesty, imagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders." Our ruling Trump said, "If it weren’t for me … (illegal immigration) wouldn’t even be a big subject." Trump’s talk about building a wall -- and making Mexico pay for it -- certainly has made headlines. But talk about America’s immigration system and proposed changes preceded the billionaire businessman’s candidacy for president. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09071	Blue Cross’ new $90-million Providence headquarters "was outfitted with $25 million in decor."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/28/bill-lynch/Bill-Lynch-campaign-claims-Blue-Cross-spent/	William "Bill" Lynch, one of the four Democrats running for Patrick Kennedy’s 1st District seat in the U.S. Congress, has been trying to rally support by repeatedly railing against Blue Cross, the health insurer whose double-digit rate increase requests have been widely condemned. The fact that Blue Cross is seeking the increase after building a towering headquarters near Providence Place mall, combined with rumors that the company spent lavishly on furnishings, has made it a tempting target. So Lynch has called on the health-insurance commissioner to deny the request, and his campaign issued a news release in May that included this statement: "Last month Lynch criticized the construction of Blue Cross’s new $90 million headquarters, which was outfitted with $25 million in decor." That would buy some pretty cushy cubicles. We wanted to know if the $25-million figure was true. When we contacted the Lynch campaign, spokesman Bill Fischer said the number also includes furnishings, such as desks and office equipment, and the sources were a Providence Business News story, which he could not locate, and an Oct. 5, 2009, Providence Journal story. We checked the Journal story but there was no reference to $25 million being spent on anything. When we asked Fischer about that, he cited this sentence in the story: "But Blue Cross president and chief executive officer James E. Purcell is proud of his $90-million ($125 million when you include furnishings and ‘soft’ costs such as fees and engineering) building and insists it is actually saving money for the health insurer." Fischer said the campaign arrived at the $25-million figure by taking the $35 million difference between $125 million and $90 million, then subtracting $10 million to be on the safe side. He said the Lynch campaign has repeatedly sought more reliable information from Blue Cross and the state Department of Business Regulation, which uses data from the health-insurance giant to rule on premium increases. But both, he said, have refused to disclose that data. "It’s the best information we could ascertain from the limited information Blue Cross will provide on this matter," said Fischer. No it’s not. It’s a number pulled out of thin air. Fischer added that Lynch has publicly repeated the $25-million claim in several venues, in news releases and on the radio. "Not once did Blue Cross refute it," he said. They don’t have to. It’s up to a candidate to know what he or she is talking about. Repeatedly presenting rough guesstimates as hard facts does not make them true. "We stand by our number," Fischer said. And we stand by our rating: Pants on Fire. By the way, we asked Blue Cross how much it spent on furnishings and received this response from Kimberly R. Reingold, director of media relations and external affairs: "The cost characterization of our decor, including workstations, office furniture, tables, seating and files, is inaccurate.

pomt-08474	"Never once did they (House Republicans) actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending. They never paid for their tax cuts."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/12/armond-budish/ohio-house-speaker-armond-budish-raps-republicans-/	House Speaker Armond Budish kicked off what he called his "rhetoric reality tour" last month in Columbus hoping to fight back against House Republicans who have painted Democrats with the usual "tax and spend" brush. At a news conference, Budish got uncharacteristically lathered up, saying that Democrats have "made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t" in slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget. The mild-mannered Beachwood Democrat then attacked the House Republican record from 1994 to 2006 when the GOP controlled the 99-member lower chamber (as well as the governor’s office and the Ohio Senate). "Never once did they actually cut spending or reduce the state budget. Even when they cut taxes in 2005, they increased spending," Budish said. "They never paid for their tax cuts." Instead, they put off the bills until last year using budget gimmicks, he said. Those are fairly inflammatory claims, and just the kind of thing that PolitiFact Ohio likes to check out, so we did some digging to see if Budish was right. First, we pored over the state budget details dating back to 1994. We quickly saw that the first part of his statement is true, as long as Budish is talking about the entire budget and not individual programs that may have seen cuts at one time or another. From 1994 to 2006, the seven state budgets approved while Republicans were in complete control increased spending an average of 9.39 percent from one budget to the next. The closest thing to a cut under Republican control was the 2005-06 budget, which went up only slightly, but included a 21 percent across-the-board income tax reduction spread over five years — which is the tax cut Budish is referring to in his comment. So far, so good. But to evaluate the second portion of Budish’s statement where he says Republicans "never paid for their tax cuts," you need a brief education in the numerous changes made to the state’s tax structure in 2005 by lawmakers. In a nutshell, a number of taxes of business and individual taxes were adjusted at the same time — some were increased by lawmakers in 2005 while others were cut or phased out entirely. A pair of business taxes that were phased out slowly by the budget that was passed in 2005 were the tangible personal property tax and the corporation franchise tax. They were replaced by a new tax on businesses called the Commercial Activities Tax, or CAT, which was phased in as the duo was ramped down. While those changes affected businesses, individual taxpayers were also affected by tax changes, including a sales tax hike and a 21 percent cut in the personal income tax rates for everyone in Ohio spread across five years. That was the plan anyway. But last year Gov. Ted Strickland proposed, and lawmakers approved, pushing the fifth year of that tax cut back a year to fill a hole in the state budget. But Budish isn’t totally correct when he says that the Republicans "never paid for" the tax cuts contained in the 2005 state budget. In fact, the 2007 state budget passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Strickland had about $1.8 billion less in revenue because of the tax cuts of 2005, according to a 2009 state budget document. That, by law, required adjustments to the budget in other places to keep the state budget balanced. Still, the impact in 2007 of the tax cuts was fairly light compared to the impact that had been projected for the current budget -- $4.2 billion. But when lawmakers adopted Strickland’s proposal to push back the final year of the income tax cuts that pushed back some of the effect. The state actually ended up with $3.4 billion less to spend in the current budget than if the tax changes of 2005 never happened. So let’s get to the grading card and see what we got: Budish is right that Republicans never actually cut spending from 1994 to 2006. And he’s right that spending went up under Republicans even when tax cuts were passed in 2005. But the second part of his statement has a hole — the bill on the tax changes started coming due in 2007 when Republicans were still in charge of the legislature and were forced to balance the budget with $1.8 billion less in revenue. Budish’s statement is largely accurate but needs additional information to see the full picture. That’s why we rate Budish’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-09054	During the year Kagan barred military recruiters from Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services, "military recruiting actually went up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/30/elena-kagan/kagan-says-height-military-recuitment-controversy-/	During her Supreme Court nomination hearing, Elena Kagan faced intense questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, about her decision to bar military recruiters from using the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services during part of her tenure as the school's dean. Kagan defended her decision and repeatedly backed it up with a claim that the number of military recruits actually went up. "Senator, the military at all times during my deanship had full and good access," Kagan said. "Military recruiting did not go down. Indeed, in a couple of years, including the year that you're particularly referring to, it went up. And it went up because we ensured that students would know that the military recruiters were coming to our campus. Because I talked about how important military service was. Because our veterans organization and the veterans on campus did an absolutely terrific job, a terrific service to their fellow students in talking to them about the honor of military service." Sessions said he was "just a little taken aback by the tone of your remarks, because it's unconnected to reality." Kagan later said she "always tried to make sure that I conveyed my honor for the military. And I always tried to make sure that the military had excellent access to our students. And in the short period of time, Sen. Sessions, that the military had that access through the veterans organization, military recruiting actually went up." We've dealt with the military recruitment issue from several angles, and here we decided to tackle the claim that the number of military recruits went up at the height of the campus controversy. In previous PolitiFact items, we have gone into some detail about the controversial history of military recruiting at Harvard Law School, which long predated Kagan's tenure as dean from 2003-2009. But the bottom line is that military recruiters were only ever barred from the school's Office of Career Services for one semester in 2005. During that time, Kagan encouraged the military to recruit through the Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a student organization (now called the Harvard Law School Armed Forces Association). In all other years Kagan was dean at Harvard Law School, military recruiters were permitted to use the Office of Career Services (despite Kagan steadfastly lodging her opposition to the military's "discriminatory recruitment" based on the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy which "deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible.") So we are really talking here about the 2005 spring semester during which Kagan arguably made it the most difficult for military recruiters, by barring them from the Office of Career Services. "The symbolic effect of this special treatment of military recruiters was important, but the practical effect on recruiting logistics was minimal," wrote Robert C. Clark, a professor and dean at Harvard Law School from 1989 to 2003, in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal on May 11, 2010. We're not big into he-said, she-said at PolitiFact, but we think a bit of point-counterpoint on Clark's statement is in order. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Orrin Hatch cited a 2002 e-mail from an Air Force recruiter who wrote, "Career Services Offices are the epicenter for all employer hiring activities at a law school. ... Without the support of the Career Services Office, we are relegated to wandering the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us. ... Denying access to the Career Services Office is tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law school -- as it has the same impact on our recruiting efforts." And a Feb. 18, 2005, letter from the Harvard Law School Veterans Association -- which was tapped by Kagan to coordinate military recruitment efforts in lieu of recruiters being afforded access to the Office of Career Services -- also suggests the 2005 policy was more than a seamless blip. The group lamented that "Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting events." Their effort, they wrote "falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services." And now the counterpoint. During the confirmation hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy submitted a letter from First Lt. David M. Tressler, who is currently deployed with the U.S. Army Reserve in Afghanistan. Tressler graduated from Harvard Law School in 2006 and wrote that "Military recruiters were never barred from campus. During the brief period when recruiters were not given access to students officially through the law school’s Office of Career Services, they still had access to students on campus through other means." "There are only a few of us each year who joined the military while attending, or after graduation from, Harvard Law. Kagan’s decision to uphold the school’s anti-discrimination policy for a brief period of time and express disagreement with DADT did not prevent us from talking with recruiters and joining." In fact, Tressler wrote, "in 2005 more graduating students joined the military than any year this decade." "To attack Ms. Kagan for a principled position she took as a law school dean that had no practical effect on military recruitment looks, from where I stand, like a political distraction," Tressler wrote. "I believe that, while dean of Harvard Law School, she adequately proved her support for those who had served, were currently serving, and all those who felt called to serve, including those like me who joined upon graduation as well as those patriots who were not permitted to do so under the policy of 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.'" So how did all this affect the number of military recruits? We contacted the Harvard Law School Office of Public Information, which provided a breakdown on the number of graduates, by class, who went into the military: 2000 -- 0 2001 -- 3 2002 -- 2 2003 -- 2 2004 -- 3 2005 -- 5 2006 -- 3 2007 -- 3 2008 -- 2 2009 -- 2 That's right, it went from three in 2004 to five in 2005. So Kagan is technically accurate that during the year in question, 2005, the number of recruits went up. And Tressler is correct that the five law school graduates who went into the military that year is the largest number from any class this decade. But by citing the statistic (without the numbers), Kagan suggests it backs the contention that her decision to bar recruiters from the Office of Career Services during the spring semester of 2005 had negligible, and perhaps only a symbolic, effect on military recruiting at Harvard Law School. That's a matter of dispute. While the former dean and a 2006 graduate now in the military say the policy had little real effect on recruiting, military recruiters clearly disagreed. The number of recruits in any given year at Harvard Law School is so small, we don't think citing the 2005 increase - by 2 from the previous year - settles the issue one way or the other. And so we rate Kagan's claim Half True.	None	Elena Kagan	None	None	None	2010-06-30T18:00:52	2010-06-29	['None']
pomt-05081	"Statistics show that more people at this time telecommute than they ride carpools, mass transit, bicycle or walk."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/03/debbie-dooley/tea-party-leader-makes-case-telecommuting/	Transportation planners and elected officials across metro Atlanta spent about two years coming up with a comprehensive list to resolve some of the region’s traffic troubles and a way to pay for it. Meanwhile, a tea party leader who opposes the plan has some ideas of her own to ease traffic congestion. And one of them involves no taxpayer funds being spent. Encourage more people to telecommute -- to work from home. "Statistics show that more people at this time telecommute than they ride carpools, mass transit, bicycle or walk," Atlanta Tea Party Patriots co-founder Debbie Dooley said during a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta. PolitiFact Georgia has seen some long lines of people waiting to ride MARTA or some of the suburban bus systems around town. There couldn’t possibly be more people who work from home than take public transportation or carpool. Or is Dooley right? Dooley said she did not mean to include carpools in her statement. She sent us an email distributed the day before the forum in which she made a similar argument about telecommuting but did not mention carpools. We still decided to examine the entire claim, since the audience wasn’t aware she did not intend to mention carpools. There’s little research on telecommuting. And much of it is several years old or questionable. In some cases, people who do work at someone’s home, like a plumber, are included as people who work at a home-based business. Most organizations use U.S. Census Bureau data to base their reports about the percentage of people who telecommute. In recent years, there’s been criticism from some members of Congress and a few statistical experts about the survey’s accuracy. Dooley said she based her statement on a report by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a fiscally conservative think tank based in Atlanta. The report examined the transportation plan, commonly referred to as T-SPLOST. Metro Atlanta residents will vote July 31 whether to approve a penny-per-dollar increase in sales tax to pay for billions of dollars in new transportation projects. Supporters say the 1 percent sales tax will fund projects to help untangle the metro region’s legendary traffic jams. Opponents, such as Dooley, say it will have little impact on traffic congestion while burdening taxpayers with billions in new sales taxes. The foundation’s report contains a chart from the Census Bureau that measured the percentage of residents in 10 major metropolitan areas who use various forms of transportation or telecommute. In the Atlanta area, nearly 78 percent of commuters drive alone. No surprise there. That was second among the list of cities. Dallas was first at 80 percent; New York was last at 50.4 percent. The rest of the list for Atlanta went as follows: carpool: 10.9 percent. telecommute: 5.1 percent. public transit: 3.6 percent. walk: 1.4 percent. bike: 0.2 percent. The report was based on 2009 research from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Census Bureau survey statistician Kin Koerber said those percentages were close to the mark in each category. The percentage of those who telecommuted was slightly higher and has increased in recent years. Researchers interviewed about 60,000 metro Atlanta residents and asked them where they work, which means of transportation they use, their departure time to work and their commute time. There are about 2.2 million metro Atlanta residents currently employed, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That equates to 1 out of 37 employed Atlantans interviewed. A September 2011 Census Bureau report on how people across the nation get to work had similar numbers to Atlanta, but there was a key difference. The percentage of Americans who use public transit (5 percent) was slightly higher than those who worked at home (4.3 percent). The most recent Census Bureau data show more people telecommute in the Atlanta area than use public transit, bike or walk to work. The national census data show slightly more people use public transit than telecommute. But Dooley overshot those numbers by throwing in carpools. First lady Michelle Obama recently made a verbal slip-up in a statement about the percentage of public high schools that offer physical education classes. She meant to say only 2 percent offer those classes daily. Obama got a False on the Truth-O-Meter. In this case, Dooley’s overall thrust of her statement is correct. But including carpools into the mix takes it down a notch or two on the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling: Half True.	None	Debbie Dooley	None	None	None	2012-07-03T06:00:00	2012-06-12	['None']
pomt-09507	"$100,000 in stimulus funds (were) used for a Martini Bar and Brazilian Steakhouse."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/19/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-says-100000-stimulus-funds-were-used-mar/	In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. "I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money," Obama said. "And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked. " But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell put out a press release titled "Stimulus Anniversary Gifts to Taxpayers: One Year of Spending Taxpayer Dollars Studying Malt Liquor and Marijuana, Researching Drunk Mice, Funding Martini Bars and Steakhouses, and Examining Facebook." It lists 15 stimulus projects. We took a look at several items on this list, as well as a few from House Republican Leader John Boehner to see if they were as billed. In this item, we look at McConnell's claim that "$100,000 in stimulus funds (were) used for a Martini Bar and Brazilian Steakhouse." This one has made the rounds. It appears on Boehner's list as well and has been cited by several Republicans as an example of stimulus waste. The short answer on this one is that it's true, or used to be. This claim refers to two projects in St. Joseph, Mo., that were awarded Community Development Block Grants by the city, with funds from the stimulus. The martini bar owner, who had been awarded $25,000 to expand his existing business, withdrew his application for the federal funds on Jan. 21, 2010, after it was discovered that the company had liens placed against it by the IRS and the state for failing to pay a little more than $8,000 in taxes, said St. Joseph's Community Development Manager Gerald McCush. "You get no funds from the stimulus if you owe the IRS money, sorry," McCush said. So, the martini bar is getting no stimulus. As for the steakhouse, a city committee awarded $75,000 in Community Development Block Grant recovery money to ECBG LLC, a private company, to build a Brazilian steakhouse downtown. "We are trying to revitalize the downtown," McCush explained. "That is a priority for the City Council. We have a pretty blighted downtown." In all, the city received $475,000 worth of Community Development Block Grant funds from the stimulus. A city committee that included two City Council members, two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, a city planner and some other city residents decided on the projects from among $2 million worth of requests. The steakhouse was selected not only because it met the city's priority for revitalizing the downtown, McCush said, but also because it would result in a number of new jobs. The steakhouse will anchor a downtown building that includes several other retail spaces. Construction of the building employed roughly 60 construction workers, McCush said, and the restaurant is expected to employ 30 people full time. The restaurant is scheduled to open in April. McConnell is largely on target with his claim about the projects and the money they were awarded in stimulus funds. The application for money related to the martini bar has since been withdrawn, though it did initially receive the award. And so we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01449	Judithanne McLauchlan "was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/03/republican-party-florida/state-gop-tries-equate-judithanne-mclauchlan-state/	While Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes ran virtually unopposed for the redrawn 22nd district stretching across Tampa Bay in 2012, he’s facing a scrappy challenger in Democrat Judithanne McLauchlan this year. The Republican Party of Florida, acting on Brandes’ behalf, is attacking McLauchlan, a University of South Florida-St. Petersburg political science professor, on an issue where constituents are liable to pay most attention -- their wallets. In a TV commercial that began running in the Tampa Bay market on Sept. 22, 2014, Brandes implied that McLauchlan wants to break with Florida orthodoxy by supporting a state income tax. A similar claim has been made by fliers being mailed to voters' homes. The ad -- which features actors pretending to be students being quizzed by a teacher -- says, "McLauchlan was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians." It goes on to say, "McLauchlan: Personal bankruptcy and a new state income tax." Accusing an opponent of wanting to raise taxes is Political Campaigning 101, but did McLauchlan really associate with people who wanted to tax Floridians at a state level? Regressive facts McLauchlan responded to the commercial the day after it appeared, issuing a press release that called it a "repulsive attack" that used "unsubstantiated falsehoods." "I oppose, will always oppose, and have always opposed a state income tax," she declared. The ad also mentions her personal bankruptcy, which McLauchlan has blamed on paying for high health insurance premiums and a surgery while she was a graduate student in the 1990s. She said the debt was too much, even after she became employed, so she filed for bankruptcy 16 years ago. She says she has since repaired her credit and is debt-free. So where did Brandes and the state GOP get the notion about a state income tax? If you look at the fine print, it reads that McLauchlan "served on Board of Directors of League of Women Voters." The ad uses her campaign site as the source. The League of Women Voters bills itself as a nonpartisan political organization focused on developing informed policy positions and voter participation. It does not endorse candidates, and members from any political party may join. McLauchlan’s spokesman clarified that she is currently a member and was on the board of the St. Petersburg chapter from 2009-11, mostly working on voter registration initiatives. She also moderated candidate forums between 2011 and 2013. The Florida chapter of the group stated where it stood on the issue in its most recent guide to public policy positions: "The LWVF supports the adoption of a state personal income tax as one part of a balanced and equitable tax structure." The booklet notes that the position was revisited most recently in 1991, although as far back as a 1966-67 study it argued that a statewide funding source that "would both be equitable and produce sufficient revenue was a personal income tax." There also is a reference in the guide that says League representatives in 2007 spoke at seven statewide Taxation and Budget Reform Commission public hearings in favor of "an equitable tax system based upon ability to pay, which suggests a state income tax." Saying the group "supports imposing" the tax isn't accurate, however, because while the League researched the issue and found an income tax a sound alternative, it doesn't lobby for the change or push it as part of a legislative agenda. They give opinions on policy issues, but don't propose processes to change laws. We asked the Brandes campaign to clarify their argument. They pointed to a couple member requirements on the St. Pete chapter’s website: First, that members of a local chapter are also part of the state and national organizations, and that the group is "open to anyone who subscribes to the mission, principles, and policies of the League of Women Voters." Second, the site says that members can’t contradict the group. "Once League (local, state or national) takes a position on an issue, members may not identify themselves as League members in publicly expressing an opinion that is in opposition to a League position," the site reads. League of Women Voters of Florida President Deirdre Macnab said that doesn’t mean members can’t disagree, just that they can’t contradict the League’s positions as a spokesperson for the organization, such as while serving as a board member. If a board member of any chapter decides to run for political office, that person must resign from the board, although they may stay in the League. "There is no requirement that members must subscribe to every position the League takes," Macnab said, suggesting the Brandes campaign is misreading the guidelines they cited. "We do have local League presidents who speak on behalf of the League, but we encourage our members to think what they want to think." Macnab said the tax hasn’t been studied since the 1990s. She said she felt most economists would agree a statewide income tax is much more fair than the policies the state has now, relying disproportionately on sales taxes, which are regressive, and property taxes. (One-time gubernatorial hopeful Nan Rich claimed earlier this year that Florida had the third-most regressive tax structure in the country, a claim we rated Mostly True.) The issue isn’t on the table either way, Macnab said, because the state Constitution has provisions preventing the institution of an income tax. Doris Weatherford, an author, women’s historian and League member who met McLauchlan through her campaign, says the group doesn’t actively support a state income tax. The League has only taken an informed stance on a policy position, as it does with countless other issues. "In the case of the income tax, the position is that this is the fairest way, but we haven’t worked to make it happen," Weatherford said. "It’s been 25 years since that was part of the platform, but even then, it didn’t say we would work for it, and still doesn’t." Our ruling The state GOP said McLauchlan "was part of a group that supports imposing a state income tax on Floridians." That’s a stretch. The group was the League of Women Voters of Florida, which concluded -- about a quarter century ago -- that a state income tax would be a fairer way to collect revenue for state programs. The group hasn’t lobbied for that goal (or even revisited its stance in years) and McLauchlan, as a member of the group, isn’t forced to espouse a position on that issue. She denies that she supports it. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05517	Says the treasurer’s office has "saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/12/ted-wheeler/did-ted-wheelers-office-actually-save-39-million-m/	PolitiFact Oregon is going to be bold and call the race for the state’s next treasurer. We know the election isn’t until November, but barring calamity, we’re pretty sure the winner will be the Democratic incumbent, Ted Wheeler. (There’s no Republican candidate in the race, and, sorry third-party candidates, but you probably won’t beat him.) The presumed win hasn’t stopped Wheeler from launching a campaign and it doesn’t stop us from checking the claimed accomplishments on his campaign website. Among them is this bullet point: "Saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments." Voters tend to like it when elected officials save taxpayer money, so we set out to find out how these savings had occurred. For example, did the office, under Wheeler’s leadership, do anything different to save these millions? We scrolled through Treasury press releases and found this from November 2011: "Oregon Treasury saved millions in management costs, comparative analysis shows." Here’s the smaller headline on that release: "Oregon’s costs were $39.3 million less than expected, based on benchmark of large funds." Wait, so Oregon didn’t "save" any money? We just didn’t spend as much as others? According to the press release, the study was conducted by CEM Benchmarking Inc. of Toronto. It rated Oregon’s costs associated with managing the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund against 18 other large pension funds. We found the report as presented to the Oregon Investment Council, the board oversees investments. And it’s accurate to say that as benchmarked, Oregon "saved" $39 million because we paid less for more expensive, but more profitable, private investments for the period ending December 2010. The fund paid more than $445 million in management costs, which is less than 0.9 percent of assets. (In case you’re wondering about the $2 million discrepancy, Wheeler’s website should state $39 million, not $37 million). In any case, that’s excellent news. But is it fair to call it money saved? The treasurer’s office thinks it’s fair since that is money the office could have spent but didn’t. "It is an accurate way to reflect a kind of savings," says Mike Mueller, the Treasury’s deputy chief investment officer and interim CIO. "... they take a snapshot and say based on this universe, we would expect your costs to be X but your costs were Y." Oregon has been regarded as a pioneer in private equity -- the more expensive to manage but more profitable investments -- since the 1980s, Mueller explained. Because Oregon has an older, more mature program, our management fees have declined over time. That’s why Oregon is lower relative to the peer group, he said. Bruce Hopkins, a vice president with CEM, says the $39 million "is very real," he said. "Oregon has been successful at getting lower fees. I would also give them some credit for seeing this as an appropriate asset class … they were getting into private equity deals that others hadn’t thought of yet." We checked previous years, to see how long the office has been "saving" money for taxpayers by paying lower-than-peer-group fees. It’s been as low as $11 million in 2001 and as high as $57 million in 2005. We should note that Randall Edwards was treasurer for much of the decade, from 2001 to 2009. Ben Westlund took office in January 2009 and served until he died of cancer in early 2010. Wheeler can’t take much personal credit for $39 million, although his office has negotiated savings. His spokesman sends along a 2011 press release that shows the office was able to negotiate even lower fees for a new investment. That likely will be reflected in future benchmarking reports. But that’s not what we’re talking about here. Wheeler said he stands by the campaign statement. "The results are for the time during which I was Treasurer and accountable for our activities and results." He pointed out that The Oregonian has also held him accountable for past office policies. We don’t agree. Had the treasurer’s office negotiated terms under Wheeler to net $39 million in actual savings from one year to the next, we would rate this statement much differently. Wheeler’s savings statement contains an element of truth. A third-party report showed that Oregon paid $39 million less in fees than its peers. But just because a peer group spent more than Oregon doesn’t mean Oregon was ever at risk of spending that much. Moreover, a key reason for our lower-than-peer-average fees is that our private investments are older, a crop of decisions that have nothing to do with Wheeler. These are critical facts that would give a different impression of the savings statement. We find the statement Mostly False.	None	Ted Wheeler	None	None	None	2012-04-12T17:26:56	2012-04-03	['None']

Yet even in this budget climate, your federal government still has the money to pay for -- please disregard our blushing -- a study examining duck penises. You read that right: duck penises. This waterfowl kerfuffle erupted earlier this week, when the conservative website CNSNews.com published a story pulling back the curtain on a $384,949 grant from the National Science Foundation for a Yale University study looking at ducks’ sexual behavior and anatomy and the evolutionary consequences. "Many duck penises are corkscrew-shaped and some scientists believe this is because of a form of evolution known as ‘sexual conflict,’" the story said. Twitter quickly took up the cause: Can’t cut spending b/c need $ to fund more studies of duck penis length" @keithcrc, March 20. $384,949 Federal stimulus funds to study "Duck Penis Length". WH still closed to tours @cincinchili, March 21. "His name is Long Duck Dong." When you're enjoying your furlough, remember that duck penis length matters. @doctrine_man, March 21. So now PolitiFact is making it our cause. We’ll fact-check the Twitter chatter stating that the federal government is funding a study about duck penises amid the austere cuts of sequestration. ‘Anti-screw anatomy’ Richard Prum is an evolutionary ornithologist at Yale University. We got him on the phone to ask: Duck penises -- really? His answer was fascinating, but first here’s a little background. In 2009, Prum applied for and received a National Science Foundation grant for his study titled "Sexual Conflict, Social Behavior and the Evolution of Waterfowl Genitalia." (It has since been renamed "Conflict, Social Behavior and Evolution," according to NSF.) The money came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus. "The funding was for three years," Prum said. "We managed to expand to a fourth year by basically being frugal." Prum and lead investigator Patricia Brennan have published several papers from their research; several are in review now, and more are forthcoming. NSF awards about 11,000 grants a year, and the process is deeply competitive. "Funding rates in this area, animal behavior, are less than 10 percent," Prum said. "Getting this money is like into getting into Yale as an undergrad." The nearly $400,000 award paid Brennan’s salary, funded the experiments at the waterfowl laboratory, kept the birds healthy and fed and covered other costs such as publication expenses and equipment. Here, in Prum’s words, is what he studied and learned: "Most birds don’t have a penis. Ducks do. They still have it from the reptilian ancestor that they shared with mammals," he said. The duck’s penis is stored inside the body, and when it becomes erect, the process of insemination is "explosive," Prum said. The duck’s penis becomes erect within a third of a second, at the same time it enters the female duck’s body. Ejaculation is immediate, and then the penis starts to regress. The length of the duck penis, as mentioned in the tweets, grows to 8 or 9 inches during the summer mating season. In winter, it shrinks to less than an inch. In duck ponds, Prum said, a lot of forced copulation occurs. Forced copulation is what it sounds like -- rape in nature. Even gang rape happens among ducks. And Prum found that while 40 to 50 percent of duck sex happens by forced copulation, only 2 to 4 percent of inseminations result from it (meaning times the female duck ends up with a fertilized egg). "The question is why does that happen? How does a female prevent fertilization by forced copulation?" he said. "The answer has to do with taking advantage of what males have evolved -- this corkscrew shaped penis." Prum said the duck penis is a corkscrew whose direction runs counterclockwise. Female ducks, he said, have evolved a complex vagina also shaped like a corkscrew -- but a clockwise one. "This is literally an anti-screw anatomy," he said. When females choose their own partners -- in other words, solicit copulation -- the muscles in the vagina are dilated and expanded. So the anti-screw effect is negated. "The females are enormously, amazingly successful at preventing fertilization by forced copulation," he said. Now, if this steamy duck sex talk reminds you of a particular Senate candidate’s controversial rape comments in 2012, Prum is right there with you. Todd Akin, who ultimately lost his Senate contest in Missouri, angered a lot of people when he claimed, "If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." Said Prum: "What we demonstrated is that what Senate candidate Akin said about rape is actually true of ducks, and why." "This to me is really about sexual autonomy, and that is why ducks are deeply important," he said. "In the face of persistent sexual violence, females have developed a mechanism to maintain control over sexual choice." If that explanation doesn’t meet your standard for useful science, Prum had this to say in defense of pure scientific research: "I have never abandoned my commitment to the notion that the primary commitment of science is to discover new knowledge. You never know when it’s going to be practical. Advanced cultures for all of history have tried to establish new knowledge." What’s this got to do with sequester? Prum’s grant began in 2009, funded by a law passed early that year that was meant to jumpstart the sputtering economy. The stimulus spending was meant to get out the door as quickly as possible, with much of spending set for 2009 and 2010. Sequestration -- sweeping budget cuts across all federal agencies -- came about from a budget deal in 2011. President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans passed sequestration as a means of forcing each other to a broader deal on deficit reduction. The cuts were never meant to be enacted, but since the two sides have not been able to strike a deal, they went into effect March 1. Democrats and Obama have decried the effects on average Americans, such as funding cuts to Head Start programs and delayed airline flights. Republicans, who are keen on trimming federal spending, have generally sounded less dire in their sequester warnings, but they’ve cried foul when the Obama administration announces such things as an end to White House tours. We should point out that in some ways, the sequester and the stimulus are two separate issues. House Republicans tried and failed to cancel unspent stimulus money. Most of the stimulus money is already out the door. The sequester, on the other hand, is intended to reduce government spending in the future. Does Prum’s grant have anything to do with the budgetary state we’re in now? Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact: "A lot of times scientific research is pilloried -- and sometimes deservedly so. It has to be taken in context of the need and results as well as the budgetary environment. "As far as linking stimulus spending and sequestration, you get to the heart of budgetary issues. Sequestration targets budget authority – the right an agency has to write a check, not outlays – the cash out the door. So the budget authority from the stimulus left the building a long time ago. It is well inside the outlay territory and not subject to sequestration." "All that said," he added, "the federal budget is a zero sum game and it is fair to compare spending on this here to spending or cuts over there. And the goofy is meant to make a point … but the reality can be quite tricky." Our ruling Folks in the twitterverse said the federal government is cutting services, furloughing employees and cancelling White House tours, but it still has the money to pay for a study examining duck penises. The study is real, and it does indeed explore the unique sexual behaviors and physical characteristics of ducks. It was funded through a National Science Foundation grant that expires this year. It’s a bit dubious to tie that grant, which was awarded with stimulus dollars, with the current budget cuts, because they arise from different budgetary issues. But is the government subsidizing research on duck penises? It sure is. We rate the tweets Mostly True.

pomt-03257	"Every (personhood) bill I’ve ever support has either had language that says we’re conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or something to that effect."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/10/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-his-support-fetal-personhood-was-a/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli says if he’s elected governor, he won’t push for strategic bills that could be used to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision that established abortion rights. He made the declaration during a July 20 debate against Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Moderator Judy Woodruff asked Cuccinelli, who opposes abortions, whether he would sign a law defining life as beginning at conception. Cuccinelli, who has backed such legislation in the past, said "when those things hit my desk, I’ll be supportive of them, "but stressed that his focus is on jobs and the economy. "Certainly I want to respect life as best we can, but we can’t defy the (U.S.) Constitution as it stands now," Cuccinelli said. "Every bill I’ve ever supported has either had language that says we’re conforming to the constitutional rulings of the Supreme Court or language to that effect. I’m not looking to make a challenge in that respect." We wondered whether every bill that Cuccinelli has backed granting personhood to fetuses has contained language saying the legislation is not intended to challenge high court rulings. We found two clear occasions when he supported such legislation during his career as a state senator from 2002 to 2009 and attorney general starting in 2010. Ana Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s campaign, pointed us to a 2012 bill introduced by Del. Bob Marshall, R-Prince William. Cuccinelli spoke at a rally supporting the legislation on the state capitol’s grounds. The bill contained this clause: "The laws of this Commonwealth shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens and residents of this Commonwealth, subject only to the Constitution of the United States and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this Commonwealth." So this measure, which passed the House of Delegates and died in the Senate, supports Cuccinelli’s debate statement. But his campaign neglected to mention the other personhood bill Cuccinelli weighed in on, and it erodes the candidate’s claim. In 2007, Cuccinelli cosponsored unsuccessful legislation that said life begins at the moment of fertilization and extended the "right to the enjoyment of life" from that point onward. The bill contained no language deferring to Supreme Court precedence. Our ruling Cuccinelli said all the bills he’s supported defining life as beginning at conception have contained language saying measures are intended to comply with Supreme Court rulings on abortion rights. Cuccinelli has backed two bills during his career; one had the qualifying clause he described and the other -- which Cuccinelli cosponsored -- did not. We rate his statement False.

pomt-04477	Less than 10 percent of President Barack Obama’s Cabinet members have private-sector experience.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/08/chain-email/private-sector-experience-short-supply-obama-admin/	Ah, the stealthy side of politics. Stolen campaign yard signs. Anonymous fliers mailed to voters disparaging an opponent. And then there’s the chain email. A PolitiFact Georgia reader forwarded us an email sent her way about President Barack Obama and asked us to examine its veracity. The email was full of charts and graphs that would suggest Obama has done a poor job as president. Some have been widely discussed and examined by PolitiFact and other fact-checking operations, such as how many Americans are receiving food stamps and a comparison of unemployment rates under Obama and his two most recent predecessors. There was one comparison that has come up before that we felt compelled to address since it hasn’t been written about on our site. Under a chart titled "Cabinet Appointments: Prior Private Sector Experience, 1900-2009," it had Obama below the 10 percent mark. Could it be? Did less than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet appointments have private-sector experience before working for the president? The email ends with a request to forward it to at least two other people. "100 would be even better," it said. Those who receive the email may want to hold off before doing so to make sure they’re distributing accurate information. One consistent theme of criticism leveled against Obama is that he does not comprehend what the American economy needs in order to grow because the president doesn’t understand how the private sector works. Obama campaign officials respond that his economic policies helped keep the nation from falling into a depression and have resulted in a modest recovery. So what about his Cabinet? Obama critics appear to be fond of claiming the president’s Cabinet had little private-sector experience, using a chart that accompanied a column written in Forbes about Obama’s "business blind spot" in 2009. Obama had by far the lowest percentage on the chart. John F. Kennedy was the next lowest, with just below 30 percent of his Cabinet appointments having private-sector experience. Most of the others were between 40 percent and 50 percent. The writer, Michael Cembalest, examined the histories of nine Cabinet positions for the comparison. The departments they headed were Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury: Conservative commentator Glenn Beck talked about the chart on his show shortly afterward, saying less than 10 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees "have any experience in the private sector." PolitiFact examined Beck’s statement, came across the Forbes article and did its own research. It found three Obama Cabinet members in those nine departments that Cembalest cited had significant corporate or business experience: Steven Chu in Energy, Shaun Donovan in HUD and Ken Salazar in Interior. Chu headed the electronics research lab at AT&T Bell Laboratories; Donovan served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co.; and Salazar has been a partner in his family's farm, and he owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado. Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas. Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of Clinton, Vilsack and Locke. Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again. Cembalest said Chu and Donovan did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study. Cembalest said he did not mean for his research to be used for political ends. Beck got a False on the Truth-O-Meter for repeating the claim, holding the commentator accountable for his words. Nearly two years later, in August 2011, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a similar claim about Obama’s Cabinet during the early stages of her presidential bid. "[Obama] has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience," she said. Not true. Her claim got a Pants on Fire. Once again, the chart contains data that the author has since said was missing some information. It seems clear that more than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience. The authors of this chain email should know better by now. We say hit the delete button on this claim. Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-10-08T06:00:00	2012-09-27	['None']
pomt-04301	Says "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations" on banks.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-roll-back-banking-regulati/	In the final days before the election, the Obama campaign has put up an ad that is a sort of Cliff Notes for voters before they walk into the voting booth. It lists many of the points Obama has used against Mitt Romney throughout this contest. It warns about the future of Medicare, support for education, tax breaks for the wealthiest, and banking regulation. On that last point, it says, "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations on the banks that crashed our economy." This fact-check examines that claim and tries to discern what Romney would do about keeping banks clear of the excesses that contributed to the financial crisis. Romney has not spoken in detail about his financial regulation plans. Sifting through his website, interviews and his public comments, we see these core elements: • He would repeal Dodd-Frank, the wide-ranging law that aims to fix many of the lapses associated with the meltdown. Romney has said he would replace the law but has not gone much beyond that concept. • Romney supports the idea of regulations. "Extensive regulation is appropriate in an industry that has such an impact on the overall economy," he said in an interview with Time. • Romney supports rules to ensure that banks have their own money at risk, as this promotes greater caution. "You have to have rules for what kind of capital has to stand behind each kind of asset on Wall Street and banks," he said on 60 Minutes. This is part of current law. • He supports greater transparency for derivatives trading. He told a group of Americans in London, mainly bankers, that "we do need to have greater transparency in the trading of derivatives, so we know what’s going on -– what kind of exposures various institutions have." Derivatives as investment devices are not inherently bad but they helped hide the weaknesses of the home mortgage market and increased the exposure of many investors when the sector collapsed. Dodd-Frank has a detailed approach to shedding light on derivatives trading. • Romney opposes the current plan for orderly liquidations when banks fail. "We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks," Romney said in the first presidential debate. However, he has not said how he would change the current law. • Romney believes regulators should move faster to define the minimum standards for a home mortgage loan. The Obama campaign backs up its claim with a Boston Globe article from last spring. The article emphasizes that Romney says he would do away with Dodd-Frank without saying what would replace it. Since that time, Romney has said a bit more, captured in that list above, but not much more. In May, one of Romney’s top economic advisers, Glenn Hubbard, said the public could expect more detailed proposals on several key fronts, including what to do if one of the biggest banks fails, consumer financial protections, and housing finance. However, those proposals never appeared. The only detail from Hubbard himself targeted the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That agency, created under Dodd-Frank, aims to stand between individuals and the marketing of unfair and deceptive financial services. Hubbard said the bureau might be moved or dismantled, with its functions passed along to existing agencies. The lack of specifics from Romney has left many people reading the tea leaves. Kenneth Scott is professor of law and business at Stanford Law School. "I very much doubt that if Romney won there would be a blanket repeal of Dodd-Frank, but there would be an effort at significant amendments," Scott said. Some have looked to Congress for clues. A Bloomberg article described the changes Republicans have passed or introduced. High on the list are looser rules governing the trade in derivatives, and especially the financial practice called "swaps." Swaps are basically insurance against the risk that a borrower won’t repay a loan. It gets more exotic, but that’s the central idea, and it’s very big business. Swaps delivered $7 billion in revenues to banks in the first quarter of 2012. Swaps played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis. Bloomberg and other news organizations have listed other areas where Republicans have worked to ease financial regulations, such as reversing the Volker Rule, which limits banks on using customer deposits to invest in trades offered by an arm of the same bank. Bloomberg offered this summary: Dodd-Frank would remain but it would be "a revamped Dodd-Frank that would accommodate some of the most profitable and riskiest activities while preserving a patina of protection for investors and consumers." Still, the precise changes Romney would support are unknown. In addition, some would argue that whatever changes emerge would not increase the odds of another financial crisis. For example, Lawrence White, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, believes the current law on big banks makes risky behavior more likely. "Repealing THAT part of Dodd-Frank would not ‘roll back regulation on the banks that crashed our economy,’ quite the contrary," White said. We asked the Romney campaign for more specifics in several areas but received no further information. Our ruling The Obama ad says "Mitt Romney’s plan rolls back regulations" on banks. Romney has provided scant details on his plans, but he has said that he would push for changes. Romney has never suggested that tougher regulations are needed, and he has said many times that government regulates too much. It is reasonable to conclude his plans would be more in line with current Republican initiatives than the present law passed by Democrats. That direction points toward fewer restrictions than are in place under Dodd-Frank. Certainly, Romney has said that the provisions for the largest banks should be replaced. Conservative analysts would say that these changes would not put the financial system at greater risk. However, the ad simply says Romney would roll back regulations on the institutions that contributed to the financial crisis. How much of a rollback is unclear, but Romney does support a lighter regulatory touch on banks, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02718	"Scott Walker raises nearly 70 percent of his money from out of state"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/22/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-70-percent-money-contributed-scott/	Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign had a healthy $2.2 million on hand at last count -- and that was after he dropped $2 million getting his 2014 re-election machine revved up. Mary Burke, the Madison Democrat challenging him, tries to use Walker’s state and national fundraising prowess against him as she courts donors for her campaign. "Will I be out-fundraised? Yes," Burke told the Journal Sentinel Dec. 13, 2013, repeating a claim she has made on the campaign trail. She added: "When Scott Walker raises nearly 70% of his money from out of state, that's going to be hard to beat. But what I feel is I'll be able to raise what I need to get the message out. My money is going to come largely from the people of Wisconsin." Only time will tell if Burke gets the nomination and is outspent by Walker. She’s expected to tap her personal wealth. But we can take a look at her claim that Walker gets more than two-thirds of his campaign cash from outside Wisconsin. Did the governor, in the year after his recall election, still attract that level of interest from around the country? Different ways to count it Burke didn’t specify a time period for her claim, so there are different ways to look at it. For example, about 62 percent of Walker’s total fundraising from his first days as governor in January 2011 through the midway point of 2013 -- the most recent reporting period available -- came from out-of-state donors. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said she meant funds raised for the 2014 election cycle. That’s a logical way to frame it, given that Burke is jumping in during that cycle. Zepecki said Burke specifically meant funds raised after the recall election Walker won on June 5, 2012. She crunched the numbers herself using the database maintained by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a widely used source on campaign fundraising. Of $4.8 million raised by Walker after June 5, 2012, 68 percent was from states other than Wisconsin, we found when using the Democracy Campaign data’s advanced search function. The data is current through June 30, 2013, when candidates last reported their fundraising to the state. So by that accounting Burke appears to be on target. But there is a problem with her analysis. The Democracy Campaign, when it issues its own reports, uses July 1, 2012 as the start date of the 2014 season. By that timeline, 59 percent of Walker’s individual receipts since then were from out of state. (Data note: The Democracy Campaign data omits some donors under $100, but that makes little difference in the bottom line.) There’s a second way to look at this, and it’s the official way described in state statutes. State law defines the recall period as extending to July 31, 2012. That July 31 marker recognizes the fact that campaigns don’t close the books on an election for several weeks or months after the polls close. Donations, for example, continue to come in, and bills must be paid. Walker booked more than $3 million in the eight weeks after the recall election, reflecting the tail end of the frenzied recall fundraising period. He booked more than 39,000 donations between June 6 and June 30 alone. Activity in his campaign accounts slowed to a trickle after July 31. So those late-June donations are pretty clearly related to the recall, and are officially considered so, but Burke’s timeframe includes them. And that makes a significant difference, because Walker’s recall fundraising was truly a national affair. Crunching our own numbers So to get the "official" number we crunched the numbers from Walker’s state campaign reports starting with donations after July 31, 2012. As part of this, we examined all individual donations instead of excluding those smaller than $100. Bottom line: We found of the $3.6 million Walker raised from the official post-recall start date of July 31 to June 30, 2013, some 56 percent was from out of state. So, still a solid majority from out of state, but not the two-thirds Burke claimed. There’s not a perfect way to do this, because Walker is free to carry over unspent recall funds and use them in the 2014 race. Walker raised money from every state in the period. Wisconsin was king, by far, followed by Texas, Illinois, Florida and California. His very largest donors are mostly from out of state "While some candidates are able to turn to a vast personal fortune to fund their campaign, we rely on folks who believe in what we’re doing, and support us by contributing their hard-earned money," Walker campaign spokesman Jonathan Wetzel said when asked about out of state contributions. In the period, 75 percent of Walker’s contributors gave $50 or less. Burke will file her first six-month campaign report in late January 2014. Our rating Burke said that "Scott Walker raises nearly 70 percent of his money from out of state." By her layman’s definition of the 2014 campaign season, she’s on target. But the number drops to 56 percent if you use the official state definition of the 2014 cycle -- an approach that weeds out a mountain of recall-related donations from the analysis, as Burke’s campaign said she intended. We rate her claim Mostly False. To comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2013-12-22T05:00:00	2013-12-13	['None']
pomt-09025	“We are picking up oil with shovels and paper and plastic bags.”	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-critical-oil-spill-clean-efforts/	Everything from human hair to industrial vacuums has been used in the effort to soak up the globs of oil floating along the Gulf coast. But when it comes to getting rid of the tar balls washing up on the Florida Panhandle’s pristine beaches, Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has some misgivings about the clean-up efforts. “We are talking about the richest and most powerful country in the world, and we are picking up oil with shovels and paper and plastic bags,” Rubio said June 26, 2010, during an interview on the show “Fox and Friends.” He added: “You would think that at this point every skimmer on the planet earth would be working off the coast of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, etc., and they are not. They are not out there.” Rubio has not backed down from his initial support of off shore drilling, “so long as it can be done safely,” said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos. During a May 5th press availability in Washington D.C, Rubio noted: "I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster." As tar balls, tar patties, tar mats, and any other conceivable name for the patches of rusty brown and black oil, continue to wash up on the Panhandle’s white sand beaches, we decided to take a closer look at Rubio’s statement on “Fox and Friends.” More specifically, his claim that only “shovels and paper and plastic bags” were being used in the effort. If hair and rubber tires are being used in the on-water efforts, surely there are other ways the gunk is being removed from the beaches? (By the way, we bring first-hand experience to this one. This PolitiFact Florida reporter is just back from weeks of reporting in the Panhandle, in between fact-checking duties. We walked the beaches in 100-degree heat with BP clean-up crews and saw first-hand the painstaking work of sifting through the sand to pick up gooey tar balls.) When we turned to Rubio’s campaign, Burgos told us to look no further than this June 29 photo from the Pensacola News Journal to prove Rubio’s claim. Sure enough, the picture, like hundreds of others taken along the Gulf Coast, shows plenty of plastic bags and shovels in sight. Paper bags, not so much. BP has said it plans to hire nearly 6,850 local beach clean-up workers along the Panhandle, to perform work like scooping up tar ball-mixed sand into “into 6-millimeter-thick plastic bags known as drum liners that they fill up to 20 pounds and then seal off with duct tape,” as detailed in a June 22 Miami Herald article. Those bags are eventually sent to Alabama to be incinerated or sent to a landfill in Campbellton, FL, on the Georgia border. The majority of clean-up efforts rely on manual labor, with workers wearing protective gear like thick rubber gloves and plastic cover-up suits. BP is largely steering away from using large machinery on the beach for several reasons. Bulldozers, for example, are not able to distinguish between oil debris and eggs laid by endangered sea turtles and shore birds. BP officials also say thick tar clogs mechanical rakes. The machinery that is being used is largely out on the water, in the form of skimming vessels, that scoop up the thick mats of oil that have formed on the surface of the water. There are currently five state-leased skimming vessels working off the Florida panhandle, but elected officials and Panhandle residents alike have complained, as Rubio does, that more skimmers should have been deployed by BP and the federal government right after the oil rig explosion to keep oil from creeping toward the shoreline in the first place. So while Rubio may have been slightly off when saying paper bags were used in the clean-up effort, there’s plenty of plastic bags and shovels being used to haul off the tar balls. We find his claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-07-07T18:34:06	2010-06-26	['None']
pomt-11783	"Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/24/ann-wagner/satanic-temple-has-not-teamed-planned-parenthood-o/	U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., has been circulating a petition, encouraging constituents to add their names to "Stand for Life" against Satanists, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. She’s posted on Twitter and Facebook, linking to a petition on her campaign website, that says "Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn." She went into more detail in an Oct. 25 Facebook post, Wagner wrote, "As Planned Parenthood continues its march through Missouri to expand abortion practices, an organization called the Satanic Temple has emerged as their ally, pressuring legislators and filing state and federal lawsuits in an attempt to erase protections for the unborn. I refuse to stand by as unabashed Satanists challenge our respect for life in Missouri. Add your name to stand in support of life." In her social media posts, Wagner also includes a graphic that shows a red pentacle next to the text, "Stand Against Planned Parenthood and The Church of Satan." We reached out to Wagner to see where she was getting this information. Her campaign manager, Brecht Mulvihill, sent us a link to a statement from The Satanic Temple, and linked to articles from The Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Newsweek, Slate and Huffington Post. We wanted to know, has The Satanic Temple "teamed up" with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri as Wagner claims on her website? Separate cases Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple have taken separate court cases seeking to lower restrictions on abortion in Missouri. In November 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging a Missouri statute that required abortion clinics to be licensed as "ambulatory surgical centers." The lawsuit also challenged requirements that stipulated that physicians who provide abortions must have admitting privileges from a nearby hospital. After a judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Director of Department of Health and Senior Services Randall Williams appealed the case. Most recently, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri lost a separate lawsuit that challenged the state’s 72-hour waiting period requirement. The Satanic Temple has filed its own lawsuits at both a state and federal level challenging the state’s informed consent materials, ultrasound and 72-hour waiting period requirements. The organization is claiming the requirements violated a Satanic Temple member’s First Amendment rights. One of the first outlets to report the simultaneous court cases was a Slate article published on Sept. 12. The author suggests a recent increase in abortion access in the state may be because of The Satanic Temple’s lawsuit, writing, "Missouri’s recent stroke of good fortune in the reproductive rights realm may have to do with intervention from the fiery underworld." The Slate article was picked up by other sites and is referenced in other articles from outlets such as The Kansas City Star and Patheos. Brietbart also wrote about the recent efforts by Planned Parenthood and The Satanic Temple. However, the Brietbart article took the story a bit further and claimed in its headline that the two organizations teamed up and that, "The Satanic Temple has often lent its muscle to pro-abortion efforts alongside Planned Parenthood." The fact-checking website Snopes debunked this and rated this claim false in a fact-check published on Sept. 14. The Satanic Temple also tweeted about their independence: "Teaming up" Wagner not only claimed that The Satanic Temple was "teaming up" with Planned Parenthood, but also the ACLU. Spokespersons from both organizations said there was no relationship with the temple. Lucien Greaves, co-founder and spokesman for The Satanic Temple, said early attempts to get the ACLU’s help didn’t work. "We are not collaborating nor competing with Planned Parenthood and we have no formal relationship with the organization," Greaves said. "We contacted the ACLU of Missouri when we were initially seeking legal counsel for the case we’re now litigating. After a few enthusiastic calls wherein we were led to believe they were interested in taking our case they soon stopped responding to our messages and we never heard from them again." Laurie F. Maffly-Kipp, a professor in the humanities and religious studies program at Washington University in St. Louis, observed that Wagner may be drawing connections between the two groups for political reasons. "It looks like a scare tactic to me," Maffly-Kipp said. "My observation is that many conservative Christians use the specter of Satanism as a way to rally support behind their cause." Church of Satan So what does The Church of Satan have to do with all of this? In Wagner’s Facebook post, she names The Satanic Temple in the text but also names The Church of Satan in the accompanying graphic. Those are two separate organizations. The Church of Satan pointed this out to Wagner by replying to her tweet with the incorrect graphic on Oct. 25, writing, "We have nothing to do with this," and linking to a statement on its website. We reached out to The Church of Satan, which confirmed that Wagner seems to have its organization confused with The Satanic Temple. The Church of Satan said it has not received a response from Wagner to its tweet, and said it believes the confusion began with "a mix of ignorance, laziness, and intentional misinformation." Our ruling Rep. Ann Wagner claimed on her campaign website that "Satanists have teamed up with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood in Missouri to roll back the rights of the unborn." The Satanic Temple, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have all disputed the notion that the organizations are collaborating, teaming up or acting as allies. Furthermore, Wagner has incorrectly lumped the Church of Satan with The Satanic Temple. To hell with this claim. We rate it False.

pomt-04725	Barack Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-began-his-presidency/	In his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president, Mitt Romney repeated a charge he’s made before: that Obama has traveled the world apologizing for America. "I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No, Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators," Romney said. We first fact-checked this claim back in 2010, when Romney published a book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. Obama’s apology tour, Romney wrote, "is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." It’s a common theme for some anti-Obama websites and commentators. But is it accurate? Obama’s early travels and remarks We looked at the seven separate speeches Romney mentioned in his book as apologies. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.) At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he talks about two sides coming together. At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Looking back at those 2009 speeches, we noticed that Obama was most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." Apologies -- or diplomatic language? In 2010, we quizzed several experts about whether Obama had apologized. Here’s a brief recap of what they had to say (read more here): • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Actual apologies In the years since we first looked into this matter, Obama or someone in his administration has formally apologized for U.S. actions. In 2012, Obama apologized for the accidental burning of copies of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Obama sent the apology in a letter to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Officials hoped the formal apology would quell violent reactions against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. A few months later, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized to Pakistan for a Nov. 26, 2011, incident involving the death of Pakistani troops. The apology was made as part of an effort to re-open supply routes to U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We should note that these apologies came toward the end of Obama’s first term, while Romney said Obama "began" his presidency with an apology tour. Our ruling Romney said Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour." But a review of Obama’s foreign travels and remarks during his early presidency showed no evidence to support such a blunt and disparaging claim. (In later years, we found two formal apologies, but they were not at the start of his presidency and not part of a tour.) While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, he typically combined those passages with praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries had erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. Calling those remarks "an apology tour" is a ridiculous charge. So we rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12393	"I think if you look at the entire federal government and the president’s commitment to (fighting opioid addiction), you’ll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/may/26/tom-price/dhhs-secretary-tom-price-says-hundreds-millions-mo/	President Donald Trump has made a lot of promises to solve the country’s opioid crisis, which killed over 33,000 people in 2015 alone. They included the pledge to build a wall on the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico and Latin America and more money to accelerate new treatment and prevention programs. Secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway reiterated Trump’s commitment to end the opioid crisis this month, as they visited New Hampshire - a state that has been one of the hardest hit by drug deaths. Their visit came a week after it was announced that the Trump administration had been planning to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy, slashing the long-running agency's budget by $364 million, or about 95 percent, in its proposed budget. As it turned out, they did not go through with such a steep cut in Trump’s final budget. Asked about the proposed cuts, Price said, "I think if you look at the entire federal government and the president’s commitment to this challenge, you’ll see that there are actually hundreds of millions of dollars increase on this issue." But do Trump’s proposals mesh with Price’s statements about increasing money for treatment, prevention and recovery? Crunching the numbers To get some clarity, we reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services to get a numbers breakdown. A spokesman for HHS responded, pointing to funding in the Congressional omnibus bill, the temporary spending measure to keep the government running that was passed in early May. "At minimum, the Omnibus provides $213 million in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic across the federal government," Alleigh Marre said. "With all that in mind, the Secretary’s comment that there is a ‘hundreds of millions of dollars increase’ across the federal government, is true." However, that number includes money that was passed by Congress in 2016, before Trump was president, and doesn’t account for the president’s proposed federal budget. Here’s the breakdown of what’s in that number: $500 million in 21st Century Cures Act grant money, which was passed by Congress under President Obama. $150 million as part of the 2017 omnibus, which includes money for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Health Resources and Services Administration to fight addiction. Marre also highlighted $12.5 million in funding for four new heroin enforcement groups within the DEA and $50 million to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to fund opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. But since Price cited Trump’s commitment to combat the opioid crisis, it’s important to note what money was approved before he took office. Budget and health care bill Beyond these budget increases, however, experts on addiction and recovery say that other proposals by Trump won’t help ease the opioid crisis and could actually make it worse. His budget is asking for almost $400 million in cuts to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which could result in fewer mental health block grants being distributed. And the recently proposed Republican health care bill, which Trump supports, proposes drastic cuts to Medicaid. The House bill calls for $800 billion of cuts to Medicaid in 10 years, on top of the $610 billion cut to Medicaid benefits sought in Trump’s budget. That means Medicaid spending could be cut by 45 percent in 10 years. This has serious implications for people who get health insurance through expanded Medicaid in New Hampshire and elsewhere, many of whom get mental health treatment and substance abuse coverage paid. And that has many treatment advocates in New Hampshire worried. "We need a system of response that includes access to treatment, recovery, and also, we have to address the supply side through supporting law enforcement in their work. I’m not seeing evidence that that’s actually happening," said Linda Saunders Paquette, director of treatment advocacy organization New Futures. It’s worth noting that the president’s budget is just a blueprint; members of Congress have said they are unlikely to approve the spending plan as written. Our Ruling Citing Trump’s commitment to fight the country’s opioid crisis, Price said the government is already spending "hundreds of millions of dollars" more to that end. More funding was approved in the recent Congressional omnibus bill to keep the government running, but other policies he’s seeking to pursue -- notably cuts to Medicaid -- could wipe out that increase and then some.

pomt-08967	"Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/20/barney-simms/are-former-atlanta-tenants-flooding-suburbs/	It's been a constant refrain in Atlanta's suburbs when there is a rise in crime. Those crime spikes are often blamed on people who used to live in the Atlanta projects. A frustrated Atlanta Housing Authority official addressed the claims in an open letter last month. "Have the suburbs been inundated with former residents of Atlanta housing projects? Absolutely not," said Barney Simms, the authority's chief external affairs officer. We decided to look into the matter. Have former housing project residents relocated to the suburbs? Or have they stayed within the city of Atlanta? The AHA built what's widely believed to be the first public housing complex in the nation, Techwood Homes in 1936. By the 1970s, many AHA developments developed reputations as high-crime areas. One apartment complex, East Lake Meadows, was so dangerous that residents called it "Little Vietnam" because of the constant shootings there. City leaders and police tried many efforts to improve public safety inside and around some of the projects. In one five-month stretch in 2007, five men were shot and killed in one AHA development, Bowen Homes. In 1994, Renee Glover became the AHA's executive director and embarked on a new strategy to transform its older developments into mixed-income communities, thinking, in part, that it would reduce crime. Some tenants moved elsewhere, using rent subsidy vouchers called Section 8. Others returned to AHA properties once they've been redeveloped. The latest round of redevelopment began in 2007. The Quality of Life Initiative, as the most recent effort was called, included the demolition and redevelopment of 10 apartment complexes and two senior citizen high-rises. In August 2007, Clayton County officials considered a plan that would require they have a copy of all residential lease agreements. The idea, Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell said at the time, was to know who was in the county and better respond to any problems unruly renters cause. Some Clayton officials worried former Atlanta Housing Authority tenants were moving into apartment complexes in north Clayton and largely responsible for a spike in violence. Former state Sen. Steen Miles made a similar claim about former AHA tenants in DeKalb County in an April newspaper editorial and in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "The people dumped from the Atlanta housing projects went to Clayton and DeKalb counties," she told the AJC. Did they come to Clayton and DeKalb? We reached out to the AHA. Its Housing Choice division tracks where its former tenants have moved. Longtime journalist John Sugg, a former senior editor of Creative Loafing, is using their data and additional research to write a book on the authority. He presented PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet from the AHA that tracks the whereabouts of about 2,600 households since the Quality of Life Initiative began. The AHA data show 2,251 households stayed inside Atlanta city limits. It shows 344 households, 13 percent, moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. The bulk of those people moved to Decatur, College Park and East Point. Since those figures come from the AHA, we looked to see if anyone else is tracking such data. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department does not track where former AHA tenants are using Section 8 vouchers, a HUD spokesman said. We did find one group that has done its own research. Georgia State University's Urban Health Initiative has been tracking the progress of tenants who lived in six AHA developments since 2008: Bankhead Courts, Bowen Homes, Herndon Homes, Hollywood Courts, Palmer House and Roosevelt House. The latter two developments are senior citizen high-rises. Their research showed 15 percent of those 330 households now live outside the city, said Deirdre Oakley, an associate professor of sociology at the university. Oakley said there's been no evidence from their group's research that shows a spike in crime in neighborhoods where these former tenants have moved. "It's easy because of the publicity that AHA has gotten to say, 'Oh, look! It's public housing from Atlanta moving into our neighborhoods,' " she said. Since an average of four people live in each AHA apartment, we multiplied that number by 344 households that AHA says has moved to other parts of metro Atlanta. That's about 1,400 people. Clayton County's population is nearly 276,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. DeKalb County's population is slightly more than 747,000, the Census Bureau data show. Even if all 1,400 of those people moved to one of those counties, is it fair to say one of those places has been "inundated" with former AHA tenants? We don't think so. The data from the AHA and Georgia State both reach similar conclusions that the percentage of tenants moving out of the city has been small. Therefore, we rate Simms' statement as True.

pomt-01020	More "than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/30/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-more-80-percent-us-sexual-traffic/	Sex trafficking, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn declared, isn’t confined to other countries. The Texas Republican said in a Jan. 27, 2015, floor speech: "You might envision brothels in foreign cities or girls being smuggled across other borders, but the sad reality is human trafficking is a problem all across the United States and at all times of the year. "But it's especially a problem surrounding big public events like the Super Bowl," Cornyn said, a theme that drew the attention of PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. "Yes, human trafficking is happening right in our own backyard, and more than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens." Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 -- a circumstance "in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age." We were curious about citizens accounting for most U.S. sex trafficking victims. Cornyn relied on 2011 government report To our query, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out an April 2011 report from the Bureau of Statistics in the Department of Justice. "This is the latest national study available that examines the citizenship status of trafficking victims," Brandewie said by email. That report says that from January 2008 through June 2010, 83 percent of confirmed U.S. victims in incidents opened for investigation of sex trafficking (including of prostitution or sexual exploitation of a child) identified by federally funded task forces were U.S. citizens. Confusingly to us, though, a chart in the report indicates 345 of 460 confirmed sex trafficking victims, or 75 percent, were U.S. citizens; the next-most-prevalent identities were undocumented (64) and of unknown citizenship (41). By email, bureau statistician Tracey Kyckelhahn, who contributed to the research, told us the report’s declared 83 percent figure was reached by setting aside (not considering) the victims of unknown citizenship in its calculation. "If you don’t know whether a victim is a citizen or not, they cannot be included because you don’t know where to put them. You would have to make an assumption about their citizen status," Kyckelhahn wrote. This decision reduced total confirmed sex trafficking victims to 419, elevating the share of U.S. citizens among confirmed victims to 83 percent. More broadly, the bureau cautioned us against reaching national conclusions from its study. That is, Kyckelhahn emailed, the resulting "numbers are not national numbers. They’re based only" on "some task forces." The point: The counted victims were confirmed by 18 of 42 "high quality" federally funded task forces representing law enforcement agencies that regularly recorded new cases; provided individual-level information for at least one suspect or victim; and regularly updated case information, the report said. Asked if there is national research on what Cornyn singled out, Kyckelhahn replied: "I seriously doubt there are national estimates," though there are probably city-specific numbers. Advocates' analyses We sought other expertise, starting with Malika Saada Saar of Rights4Girls, which describes itself as a human rights organization focused on gender-based violence and its impact on the country’s vulnerable young women and girls. Saar, recommended by Brandewie, said by email the idea most victims are citizens is consistent with data she has seen emerging from California, Florida, New York and Connecticut "where many, if not most, of the children identified as trafficked and exploited are U.S. kids." Also, she said, it’s consistent with what her group hears from organizations serving trafficked and exploited children and youth. A web search led us to Carol Smolenski, executive director of Brooklyn-based ECPATUSA, a group whose mission is to "protect every child’s basic human right to grow up free from the threat of sexual exploitation and trafficking." Smolenski, who said she’s worked against child trafficking for nearly a quarter century, said generally, the lack of valid trafficking data "has always been the problem." And, she said by phone, there isn’t comprehensive national research showing the citizenship of U.S. sex trafficking victims. Smolenski said it’s likely the 83 percent figure that Cornyn relied on overstates the prevalence of U.S. citizens among victims. That’s because international victims living here are "hidden within immigrant communities," Smolenski said, and less likely to be noticed by police like ones participating in the task forces cited by the Justice Department. Smolenski guided us to Shared Hope International, a U.S. group that combats sex trafficking. By phone, administrator Jocelyn Bell told us the 83 percent figure is the only known indicator of citizenship--and an incomplete one. "Unfortunately," Bell said by phone, the national "research just isn’t there/hasn’t been funded." So, she said, "we just aren’t sure" what which victims nationally are citizens. By email, Brandewie pointed out the senator relied on a government report that hasn’t been contradicted by other research. Our ruling Cornyn said more "than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens." That’s consistent with the only available figure we spotted. But you can get to 75 percent from the same study and, perhaps more significantly, a statistician involved in the work advises against saying the 83-percent figure, based on information from 18 law enforcement task forces, reflects the share of victims who are citizens across the country. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-09604	"Close to half of the folks in this country illegally entered legally (but) overstayed (their ) visas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jan/18/marco-rubio/fla-republican-rubio-says-close-half-illegal-immig/	Florida U.S. Senate hopeful Marco Rubio has hit the big time -- Glenn Beck's radio program. During a wide-ranging interview on Jan. 14, 2010, Beck told Rubio that illegal immigration would be the big issue of the fall 2010 election. Rubio responded that he thinks Republicans need to be the party that supports and promotes legal immigration. Then, he added: "Close to half of the folks in this country illegally, entered legally (but) overstayed (their) visas," Rubio said. "So we've got to get a hold of this visa program, too." Rubio, the son of Cuban-born parents, claims people remaining in the United States on expired visas are nearly as big a problem as people illegally crossing the U.S. border. Is he right? The border, of course, continues to be the dominant symbol of the immigration debate (see phrases "secure the border" and "border fence" for proof), but more and more questions are being asked about people who enter the United States legally but fail to leave when they should. At least four of the 9/11 terrorists were in America on expired visas, and the government has been criticized for lacking a system that can track or even count the number of people living in the country on expired visas. To back Rubio's claim, spokesman Alex Burgos directed us to a 2006 National Public Radio report about illegal immigration. The report, filed from the U.S.-Mexico border in Douglas, Ariz., said that "nearly half the 12 million people illegally in the country didn't cross the desert or pay a smuggler ... they crossed legally at a point of entry." The NPR story points to a study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, a group that examines the U.S. Hispanic population. The Pew report, published in May 2006, indeed concludes that 40 to 50 percent of people living in the United States illegally entered the country legally through ports of entry. The percentages are right in line with what Rubio suggested on the Beck program. How did Pew get there? Pew relied on a 1997 Immigration and Naturalization Service report that attempted to quantify the number of people overstaying visas. The INS report tried to match arrival and departure documents of people entering and leaving the United States to calculate how many people were living in the country on expired visas or expired border crossing cards. It concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the country legally. That data became the baseline for future government studies. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the General Accounting Office took the data collected by the INS (now Citizenship and Immigration Services), and tried to extrapolate their own estimates. The Department of Homeland Security released a report in January 2003 that found 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in 2000 had entered the country legally. Trying to make the same estimate, the General Accounting Office produced three percentages using different methodology. In one case, the GAO used a survey of more than 1,000 adult green-card holders finding that of the 300 who admitted once being in the country illegally, 31 percent said they had overstayed their visas. In a second scenario, the GAO used arrest data on a group of 917 illegal immigrants and found that 246, or 27 percent, had been in the United States on expired visas. A second set of arrest data provided a much different result. Of 243 cases of illegal immigrants working at retail chain stores, 138 (57 percent) had been living on outdated visas. The GAO said that the Department of Homeland Security's methodology was "complex, indirect, and marked by potential weaknesses." Back to the Pew estimate. Researchers at Pew say they took the 1997 government report and tried to apply it to 2005, with a few minor modifications. Pew concluded that of the then 11.5 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States, 4.5 million to 6 million entered the country legally. Researchers admit it's an estimate. (The overall number of illegal residents also is an estimate, it's worth noting. According to USA Today, the department estimates the number of illegal residents by subtracting the number of foreign-born people who are in the United States legally from the Census estimate of the total foreign-born population. The most recent estimate, from January 2009, puts the number of illegal residents at about 11.6 million.) "The government has a pretty good idea of how many people come into the country if they fill out one of the forms, but it does not have a full count of how many leave," the Pew report said. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which now includes Citizenship and Immigration Services, told PolitiFact he is unaware of any other government studies attempting to quantify the number of people overstaying their visas. Pew also says the government has not published any new estimates. We couldn't find any, either. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in December that while the government is working on a way to document, and ultimately apprehend, people overstaying their visas, one doesn't exist yet. "I don't think that we can say with precision what percentage of visa holders are stay over," Napolitano told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "But I think we can say that the issue of the visa overstays has been one of the kind of most difficult but top priority problems that we've been working on this last 10 months." What we're left with then is a series of numbers -- all different, all educated guesses. Rubio says close to half of all illegal immigrants entered this country legally but overstayed their visas. Some estimates, by Pew and one by the GAO, support that. But others put the number lower, closer to one-third. The difference between the estimates represents about 2 million people, not an insignificant number. We can't fault Rubio for using the numbers he did. But it seems like adding a little context would be appropriate. We rate Rubio's claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-01-18T17:27:13	2010-01-14	['None']
pomt-06581	"A construction worker who’s making $50 or $60 grand a year shouldn’t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who’s making $50 million a year. And that’s how it’s working right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-construction-workers-pay-higher-/	In several appearances recently, President Barack Obama has emphasized tax fairness across the income spectrum. In remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sept. 22, 2011, Obama sought to promote his American Jobs Act by visiting a "functionally obsolete" bridge spanning the Ohio River. The bill, he said, "would put people back to work rebuilding America -- repairing our roads, repairing our bridges, repairing our schools." During the speech, Obama said that "a construction worker who’s making $50 or $60 grand a year shouldn’t be paying higher tax rates than the guy who’s making $50 million a year. And that’s how it’s working right now. Because they get all these loopholes and tax breaks that you don’t get." A few days before Obama’s visit to the bridge, we published a story analyzing a similar comment Obama made in a speech on the economy. "Middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires," Obama said in the earlier speech. "That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. There is no justification for it. It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million. Anybody who says we can’t change the tax code to correct that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax loophole so long as they live, they should be called out. They should have to defend that unfairness -- explain why somebody who's making $50 million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on their taxes, when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying a higher rate." We received many requests from readers to fact-check this comparison. But we decided we weren’t able to rate Obama’s claims on the Truth-O-Meter because we don't do Truth-O-Meter items on "shoulds" or "shouldn'ts." Those are opinions, not facts. However, in his Cincinnati speech, Obama did make a comment that was Truth-O-Meter-ready. By saying "and that’s how it’s working now," Obama is saying this pattern of taxation is a common practice. Is it? We found an IRS chart for tax year 2008 that shows a variety of tax information broken down into 18 ranges of adjusted gross income for the filer. This chart lists three types of tax returns -- filers who have income for a child who earns more than $1,900 (meaning the child’s income is taxed at the parent’s rate); those who have income reported on Schedule D (primarily capital gains); and those without either of these types of income. For the purposes of our calculations, we are combining data for all three types of returns. According to this chart, slightly fewer than 19 million filers reported adjusted gross income between $50,000 and $75,000. (This income range stretches slightly higher than what the president mentioned, but it’s as close as we can get with available statistics.) The average income tax rate for these returns was 8.3 percent for those with Schedule D income and 7.8 percent for filers with neither Schedule D nor child income. The rate was higher for those with child income -- 20.4 percent -- but this group included only 4,543 returns, or two-tenths of one percent of all returns in that income range, which is small enough to be negligible for our purposes. The bottom line is that taxpayers in Obama’s construction-worker income range tended to pay an effective federal income tax rate of 7 percent to 8 percent. Calculating the comparable figure for those earning $50 million was trickier. The same chart provides a figure for returns with at least $10 million in adjusted gross income. There were 11,050 returns in this category, and their effective federal income tax rate ranged from 17.9 percent to 28.5 percent, depending on which of the three filing categories they fell into. Clearly, then, the $10 million plus crowd is paying a higher average tax rate than the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd. But remember that Obama said $50 million, not $10 million. Does the math change for those who are even richer? The best data we could find addresses the 400 highest-income taxpayers in the nation. In 2008, the cutoff to make it into this rarefied group was an income of $109.7 million -- which is above Obama’s $50 million threshold. These taxpayers had an average federal income tax rate of 18.1 percent, which is also higher than the rate paid by the $50,000 to $75,000 crowd. So by these calculations, Obama would be incorrect in most cases. But that’s not the end of the story. These figures are for federal income taxes only. There are also a bunch of other federal taxes that could, and probably should, be included in the calculation. The burden for some some taxes, including corporate taxes, excise taxes and estate taxes, are hard to attribute to individual returns, so we’ll set those aside. But one federal tax is straightforward to throw into our calculations: payroll taxes. Payroll taxes fund Social Security and Medicare. In general, payroll taxes hit lower-to-middle-income taxpayers harder than high-income taxpayers, for two reasons. First, workers with low to moderate incomes are more likely than rich taxpayers to make the bulk of their income from salaries and wages, which are subject to the payroll tax, rather than capital gains or other types of investment income, which are not subject to payroll taxes. For the very rich, that pattern is reversed. Second, Social Security tax is levied only on the first $108,600 of one’s salary, meaning that virtually all of the earnings of someone making $50,000 a year is subject to it. That wouldn’t be the case for someone who’s very rich. We asked two researchers at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institute Tax Policy Center, Roberton Williams and Rachel Johnson, for their advice on how to factor in payroll taxes. They estimated that combining the workers’ share of the payroll tax with the employer’s share -- the usual practice among economists -- would mean an extra 15 percentage points for our hypothetical middle-class worker, and less than 2 additional percentage points for the high-income taxpayer. Adding these to the percentages we previously found for the income tax alone produces a new, "final" rate of 22 to 23 percent for the construction worker and 20 to 30 percent for the $50 million earner. So it’s certainly possible that a given construction worker pays a higher effective tax rate than a given $50 million earner -- but it’s also not a guarantee. There is a lot of variation for taxpayers in both categories -- especially when you consider that we have been using average tax rates rather than median tax rates, which means that a small number of very high incomes can throw off the average. Our ruling Obama has made a sweeping statement that it’s common, even typical, for a $50,000-a-year construction worker to pay a higher tax rate than someone earning $50 million a year. The reality is that it’s hard to know for sure. We found that a typical taxpayer with $50,000 in income pays 22 to 23 percent in income and payroll taxes, while the comparable rates for very, very wealthy taxpayers are in the 20 to 30 percent range. The data isn’t specific enough for us to be able to say if a majority of $50 million earners pay tax rates at the low or high end of that 20 to 30 percent range. We do think it’s safe to say that some of those very high earners pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than workers who earn $50,000, and some don’t. So, on balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-09-27T17:36:02	2011-09-22	['None']
pomt-12164	"More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/aug/03/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-more-texans-have-jobs-ever/	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott drew cheers from supporters in San Antonio as he vowed to keep the Texas economy rocking and laid a claim to history. The Republican governor, kicking off his re-election campaign, said in July 2017: "And since I took office, in just the last two and a half years, in Texas, we’ve added more than 450,000 new jobs. More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state." That jobs-gained number sounded a little low. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures we drew from a bureau economist, Cheryl Abbot, when Abbott took office in January 2015, the state was home to nearly 11.8 million non-farm jobs. As of June 2017, that count was up by about 507,500, exceeding 12.3 million. We decided to check whether more Texas residents have jobs than ever before. Abbott’s campaign didn’t answer requests for the basis of the claim. Meantime, economists concurred that according to bureau figures drawing on U.S. Census Bureau surveys, more than 12.8 million Texas residents had jobs from April 2017 through June 2017--with the April 2017 count of 12,872,506 employed people setting a record, though the tally subsequently slid marginally, reaching 12,848,980 in June 2017. A bureau-provided chart shows the dip in employment after that count had mostly steadily increased since January 2015: SOURCE: Chart showing Texas Local Area Unemployment Statistics, BLS (received by email from Cheryl Abbot, regional economist, BLS, July 21, 2017) The economists we queried noted that because Texas continues to grow in population, it makes sense, barring economic disaster, that you’d see more people having jobs year after year. "Status quo in Texas," Mark J. Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint, told us by email, "it’s always had steady job growth." Perry passed along a chart showing the nearly uniform annual upticks in employed Texas since 1939: SOURCE: Chart based on data posted by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (provided by email from Mark J. Perry, Ph.D., scholar at The American Enterprise Institute, professor of Finance and Business Economics, School of Management, University of Michigan-Flint, July 28, 2017) So, Abbott was mostly right about the record count of Texans with jobs at the time he spoke. Jobless rate, employment-population ratio Other indicators provide context, however. For instance, the month before Abbott kicked off his re-election effort, the state’s unemployment rate of 4.6 percent--as in the share of able workers unsuccessfully seeking employment--was not a record low. We counted 59 months since 1976 when the Texas jobless rate was lower, per an Abbot-provided chart. Also, a ratio that compares the number of people with jobs to the population as a whole was higher for Texas and other states in the 1990s, a facet explored by PolitiFact in Washington in July 2016. That story also noted that nationally since the end of the Great Recession, the U.S. employment-to-population ratio had climbed, slowly but fairly steadily. When we asked, Abbot shared bureau figures rooted in Census Bureau survey findings to represent changes in the Texas employment-population ratio. Similarly, economist Tara Sinclair, an associate professor at George Washington University, drew on bureau figures showing that the state’s employment-population ratio exceeded 65 percent from 1995 through 2000 but fell to 61.5 percent in 2014 and to to 60.9 percent and 60.7 percent, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. In the latter year, the bureau says, that ratio reflected 12,671,801 Texans with jobs out of 20,861,611 residents. By email, Sinclair wrote that similar "to the national pattern for the employment-population ratio, Texas is still low relative to its historical peak (although doing a bit better than the national ratio)." SOURCE: Chart drawing on BLS annual data for Texas (received by email from Tara Sinclair, associate professor of Economics and International Affairs, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, George Washington University, July 21, 2017) Our ruling Abbott said: "More Texans have jobs today than ever before in the history of our state." By raw numbers, the more than 12.87 million employed Texans in April 2017 set a record though that count had dipped to 12.85 million by the time Abbott spoke. Also, the state’s June 2017 jobless rate, 4.6 percent, exceeded the rate in more than 50 months since 1976 while Texas in 2016 (like the nation) had an employment-population ratio trailing what it used to be.

pomt-03105	Tuition at Rutgers has increased 10 percent since Gov. Chris Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/22/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-rutgers-tuition-has-spiked-10/	Death and taxes aren’t the only sure things in New Jersey. Increasing college tuition costs are pretty much a given, too – especially on Gov. Chris Christie’s watch, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie, a Republican, in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. Rutgers tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education," Buono told students during a recent stop at the university's New Brunswick campus. While the cost of an education at Rutgers and other schools in New Jersey has certainly risen in recent years, we were a bit stunned by this Rutgers Law School alumna’s claim: not only has tuition at the state university climbed by less than 10 percent from the time Christie became governor in January 2010 to present, Buono’s putting blame where it doesn’t belong. Let’s start by reviewing tuition costs for Rutgers since Christie’s been in office. Tuition for in-state residents at Rutgers was $9,926 for the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first year that a Rutgers budget was crafted during Christie’s tenure as governor. Tuition is $10,718 for the current 2013-2014 academic calendar. That’s an increase of 7.97 percent, not 10 percent. David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, told us it would be more appropriate to compare tuition and fees from 2009-2010 – before Christie took office – to 2013-2014. So we looked at those numbers, too. Tuition and fees for 2009-2010 was $11,886, compared with $13,499 for the current academic year. That’s an increase of 13.57 percent, which is in line with Buono’s claim. But there’s a key difference: Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase so we removed fees from the equation and compared tuition from 2009-2010 ($9,546) with 2013-2014 ($10,718). The difference is an increase of 12.27 percent. That brings us to another critical point: Buono claims the increase has occurred "since Christie took office." Turner said Christie's cuts to education had long-reaching effects on students. "One of the Governor's first major acts was to slash New Jersey's higher education budget by more than $170 million," he said in an e-mail. "By cutting the budget, the costs fell on to students who are now shouldering a 13% increase in tuition at our flagship university. These cuts unfairly place the burden on students and make it harder for them to get the skills they need to compete in the workforce of tomorrow." Christie in 2010 proposed cutting $173 million from higher education funding as the state faced a variety of deficits at the height of the recession. But is he solely to blame for tuition hikes at Rutgers? No. In fact, the governor of New Jersey has nothing to do with setting tuition costs at colleges and universities. Under state law, the Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university’s annual budget, a spokesman told us. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak agreed. "Governors have no role in setting tuition, room/board and various fees at Rutgers," Drewniak explained in an e-mail. "The Board of Governors votes annually to set those rates based on recommendations from the school’s administrators. Surely, the Senator knows this given her vast experience in the legislature." It’s worth noting that impacts from the recession also were being felt statewide at that time, even in education. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Our ruling Buono said during a recent visit to Rutgers that the university's tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he "cut funding for higher education." When looking strictly at tuition costs, Rutgers tuition has increased 7.97 percent from the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first Rutgers budget done after Christie became governor -- to the current 2013-2014. The increase, however, is 12.27 percent if measured from the year before Christie became governor. As for blame, state law makes clear that the Rutgers Board of Governors -- not the governor himself -- sets tuition rates for the university. And while it's true that Christie did cut education funding, he doesn't bare the bulk of the blame for the tuition hikes. Many factors were involved. As a result, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09058	"I have a record on the environment of creating green energy ... taking trash and turning it into cash."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/30/vernon-jones/jones-says-he-helped-turn-trash-cash/	This one had us wondering. Vernon Jones, a Democratic candidate for Georgia's 4th Congressional District, discussed his environmental credentials at a recent candidate forum. He pointed to a program created during his days as DeKalb County's chief executive officer. In July 2005, the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners approved Jones' plan to convert methane gas into electricity from one of its landfills and sell it to Georgia Power. "I have a record on the environment of creating green energy by capturing methane gas at our landfills and selling it to Georgia Power and they in return selling it back as green energy -- taking trash and turning it into cash," Jones told the audience at the June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta. It's been five years since the county government signed on with Georgia Power. So we decided to take a look at the initiative and see how it's working out. Is DeKalb, as Jones claimed, "taking trash and turning it into cash"? First, a brief explanation on how this works. Landfill gas is largely composed of methane and carbon dioxide. By burning gas in boilers, Georgia Power can produce steam for power generation, according to its Web site. The company said the landfills can produce as many as 8 megawatts of electric power, enough to power eight Super Wal-Marts. More than 500 agencies across the nation have similar programs. DeKalb is doing it at the Seminole landfill, located near the county's southern edge. The environment is a big issue for Jones, who was CEO from 2001 through 2008. Jones won several awards for his efforts to preserve more green space in the county, primarily through a $125 million bond referendum that voters approved in 2001. Jones is also hoping to capitalize on a major concern in Georgia -- unemployment. His campaign slogan is "Jobs First," and Jones is trying to convince voters that some of his economic development efforts, like the gas to energy program, are reasons why they should give him a shot in Washington. The state's unemployment rate in May was 10.2 percent. It was 9.5 percent a year earlier. In 2006, the county built a facility to convert the gas to electricity at a cost of $5.3 million. DeKalb has since spent $1.6 million on maintenance and operations, county spokeswoman Angela Walton said. And how much has DeKalb collected from the program? Walton said $3.9 million thus far. DeKalb projects it will collect nearly $1.1 million this year and slightly more in 2011. Some environmental protection groups, such as the Sierra Club, dispute the potential profit margin for DeKalb and other facilities that convert gas to electricity. They said the operating costs will eventually exceed profits when governments spend more money to pay for the environmental impact of methane -- which has high global warming potential -- leaking during the conversion process. (The Sierra Club said a higher percentage of methane leaks into the atmosphere when you convert gas to electricity.) The Sierra Club's board of directors voted last year to oppose the creation of any new landfill gas-to-energy facilities. "Methane is a dangerous gas that needs to be controlled," said Mark Woodall, the Sierra Club's Georgia chapter chairman. "It doesn't need to be regarded as the answer to all renewable energy needs." For the record, the Sierra Club has endorsed the incumbent congressman, Hank Johnson, in this race. Since 2006, DeKalb has spent about $6.9 million on the gas-to-electricity program. It has collected $3.9 million in revenue in that time span, with an estimated $2.1 million on the way in the next two years. Most business ventures have start-up costs, and DeKalb had some in this project. The revenue is on pace to soon exceed the start-up costs and expenses. DeKalb is, Jones said, converting "trash into cash." We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Vernon Jones	None	None	None	2010-06-30T06:00:00	2010-06-03	['None']
pomt-13294	"ICE just endorsed me."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-says-ice-endorsed-him/	Donald Trump boasted during the second presidential debate about support he’s received from agents who patrol U.S. borders and enforce immigration laws. "ICE just endorsed me," the Republican nominee said Monday at the debate in St. Louis, Mo. "They've never endorsed a presidential candidate." Did a federal agency endorse Trump? No. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws and has more than 20,000 employees, according to its website. But Trump does have the support of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union that represents 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. Trump posted a statement about the union’s endorsement on his campaign website Sept. 26. The first-ever endorsement was voted on by the membership, with Hillary Clinton receiving only 5 percent of the vote, said Chris Crane, president of the National ICE Council, in the statement posted on Trump’s website. "America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States," Crane said in the statement. "We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America’s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives." The National Border Patrol Council, which represents 16,500 agents, has also backed Trump. But that was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times. Our ruling Trump said, "ICE just endorsed me." He made it sound like a federal agency had taken the remarkable step of formally supporting him. But ICE, which enforces federal immigration laws and employs more than 20,000 people, cannot do that. He has the support of employee groups, but that’s vastly different than what he said at the debate.

pomt-05983	"More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can’t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/23/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-unemployment-among-young-vets-t/	Hiring armed forces veterans is nothing new for GrafTech International, a high-tech manufacturer based in Cleveland for 125 years. The practice has been beneficial, the company says, because veterans have the traits of leadership, teamwork and dedication it seeks. Now looking to hire more veterans for up to 45 jobs at its Lakewood and Parma, Ohio, facilities, GrafTech has found an added benefit: tax incentives. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act, which provides job training for service members making the transition to civilian life, also provides tax credit of up to $9,600 to companies hiring unemployed veterans. (VOW stands for Veterans Opportunity to Work.) The legislation was signed into law in November. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who co-sponsored the act, visited GrafTech to highlight the need for it. "Today, many veterans -— including our young veterans -— face an unacceptably high unemployment rate," the Democrat said. "More than one in five of veterans aged 20 to 24 can’t find a job to support their family or to ease the transition to civilian life." More than one in five means an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent among young veterans. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. It's considerably higher than the national jobless rate. We asked Brown's office where the figure came from. They referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose monthly Current Population Survey provides official statistics on employment and unemployment in the United States. The bureau collects data about veterans, in tracking various segments of the workforce, and last October it updated a detailed report on the employment situation of veterans in 2010, the latest figures available. Among the findings: The jobless rate for veterans of all eras combined was 8.7 percent in 2010, slightly lower than the 9.4 percent for non-veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans who served in the military at any time since September 2001 -- a group referred to as Gulf War-era II veterans -- was 11.5 percent. Young male veterans, or those ages 18 to 24, had an unemployment rate of 21.9 percent. It’s worth noting that the BLS considered that 21.9 percent rate as "not statistically different from the jobless rate of young male non-veterans," which was 19.7 percent. But Brown wasn’t citing the statistic to contrast it with the unemployment of non veterans. Rather, he used the GrafTech appearance and the statistic to argue that the country owes it to service members to help them transition back to civilian life. "Service members who risk their lives protecting our nation shouldn’t have to wonder whether or not they’ll be able to find a job when they leave the service," Brown said. "Just as we invest in our service members while they’re on the battlefield, we should do the same when they return home." Brown accurately cited the jobless rate for younger veterans. That the non-veteran rate is also high is a piece of additional information that helps provide a clearer picture of the unemployment rate for all younger men. On the Truth-O-Meter, Brown’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2012-01-23T06:00:00	2012-01-18	['None']
pomt-03499	Says Texas lawmakers agreed to cut state's rainy day fund in half, spending "$4 billion from current $8 billion."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/07/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-legislators-spending-4-billi/	As Texas lawmakers edged toward agreement on future spending, a conservative advocate warned that the GOP-majority Legislature was halving state reserves. In a May 22, 2013, Twitter post, Michael Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, which advocates less government, wrote: "#txlege will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion." Sullivan was referring to the kitty informally known as the state’s rainy day fund. As authorized by voters in 1988, the fund accumulates money from portions of oil and/or gas production taxes. In the latest state revenue forecast, issued Jan. 7, 2013, state Comptroller Susan Combs said the fund’s balance would be $8.1 billion by the end of August 2013, assuming lawmakers did not take money out. Due to additional oil-and-gas tax revenue transfers, Combs projected the fund to grow to $9.83 billion at the end of August 2014 and to $11.76 billion a year later. So, were lawmakers cutting the fund from $8 billion to $4 billion as Sullivan said? To our inquiry, Sullivan noted the fund’s 2013 balance of $8.1 billion. And, he said by email, taking "out $4 billion is taking out half of the money." He also said he has doubts about the fund’s future projected balances of greater than $8 billion. "That is a forecast," he said. "By definition, it is NOT money currently in the bank, or even an asset. In the bank is $8.1 billion. People hope that it will have $12 billion by late-ish 2015." "I know legislators want us focused on the pre-hatched chicks," Sullivan said, but "I prefer to count the chickens that have already emerged from the eggs. That is, the current fund balance IS $8 billion. Every other number about the" fund balance "is a forecast. Indeed, looking out to 2015 is not even pre-hatched eggs, it's pre-conceived chickens." His analysis made us hungry to learn what lawmakers were voting to take from the fund when he tweeted. John Barton, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on fiscal matters, told us by telephone that lawmakers approved two measures with a bearing on transfers from the fund. A proposed constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, would launch water infrastructure funds starting with $2 billion from the fund, if voters approve the proposition on the November 2013 ballot. Lawmakers also approved House Bill 1025, which awaited the review of Gov. Rick Perry as of June 6, 2013. This measure provides for the $2 billion transfer that would be touched off if voters agree to the proposed amendment. In addition, according to the legislation’s fiscal note, $1.94 billion would be transferred from the rainy day fund by the end of August 2013, with $1.75 billion of that making up for a payment to school districts that was postponed by the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature. Lesser amounts would be spread among programs overseen by the governor, the Department of Public Safety, the Parks & Wildlife Department and firefighting agencies based at Texas A&M University. By our read, this shakes out to $1.94 billion in spending from the rainy day fund through August 2013 and, if voters approve, $2 billion more by the end of August 2015, for $3.94 billion in total. It seems, too, that the rainy day fund stands to be reduced by about 25 percent as of the end of August 2013--from a balance of $8.1 billion to a little more than $6.1 billion. And the fund could shrink from an Aug. 31, 2015, projected balance of about $12 billion to about $8 billion, down 33 percent. These calculations assume HB 1025 making it into law and SJR 1 winning voter approval. We ran this thinking by Sullivan, who replied by email that we were adding layers to his tweet, in that the $3.94 billion in intended spending accounts for half of the fund’s 2013 balance of about $8 billion. "Some of this spending could be vetoed by the governor or the voters, but the bottom line is that the Legislature did authorize spending half of the current balance," Sullivan said. "The comptroller has projected a higher balance through the end of fiscal year 2015 – but that’s a projection vs. what’s actually in the account today." We also shared our 25 percent/33 percent analysis with fiscal experts who track legislative deliberations. By email, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, and Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, said our breakdown seemed accurate. Talmadge Heflin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said Sullivan got it right. Craymer wrote: "If all of the (legislated) appropriations would take effect in 2013," Sullivan’s "Twitter statement would be correct as of the end of 2013; however, all of the appropriations don’t take effect in 2013. The water appropriation won’t happen until and unless voters approve, with the election in November 2013, which falls in the 2014 fiscal year." Craymer, who is a former chief revenue estimator for the state, also noted that about the time of that election, Combs plans to deposit more money into the fund thanks to "excess oil and gas severance taxes collected in 2013. That deposit is currently estimated at $1.7 billion," Craymer wrote, "but will probably be higher. In 2015, another deposit currently estimated at $1.8 billion will be made," Craymer said, "so essentially the fund is rapidly replenishing itself." If all the legislated spending takes effect, he said, and money gets put into the fund as projected, its balance will go from $6.1 billion at the end of August 2013 to $5.9 billion a year later and $7.8 billion in August 2015. "While there will certainly be less money in the fund compared to what could be there, the actual balance itself will remain somewhat flat," Craymer said. DeLuna Castro summed up by email that if expectations hold, the fund’s balance will not drop to $4 billion at all. Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, described the "ifs" of legislation becoming law or voters approving the proposed amendment or the comptroller depositing more money into the fund as matters of speculation. The nearly $4 billion is nearly half the fund’s 2013 balance, Heflin emailed, so "it looks like the Legislature authorized the fund to be drawn down by half of the current balance." Our ruling Sullivan tweeted that lawmakers "will be drawing current Economic Stabilization Fund down by half: $4 billion from current $8 billion." The $4 billion figure approximates legislated withdrawals from the rainy day fund over more than two years, assuming one measure makes it into law and another wins voter approval. However, it’s not correct that the fund will be halved. Its expected August 2013 balance of $8.1 billion could be cut by nearly $2 billion, or 25 percent. Down the road, the fund’s projected balance of nearly $12 billion at the end of August 2015 could shrink by 33 percent. This statement skews these facts by counting current and future expenditures solely against the fund’s current balance. Put another way, it assumes all the legislated spending will occur while disregarding expectations that the fund will also accumulate more revenue. The claim has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07215	Says public education will get more money in 2012-13 though lawmakers cut $15 billion in overall spending.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/04/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-lawmakers-increased-public-s/	Michael Sullivan, who exhorted legislators to hold the line on the 2012-13 state budget, suggests things aren’t as terrible as critics say. Specifically, Sullivan said in a May 26 tweet: "State budget being cut $15bil by #TxLege, but public education is getting more money than last biennium." Is that the deal? Some background: The Republican-steered Legislature dealt with a $20 billion-plus shortfall by writing a budget that appropriates $172 billion, which is down $15 billion from what the 2009 Legislature appropriated for 2010-11, as Sullivan says. Gov. Rick Perry and others have noted the new budget doesn’t require tax increases and also doesn’t tap the rainy day fund, which is projected to hold more than $6 billion by the end of August 2013. The same budget whittles programs, though. It’s $4.8 billion shy of covering projected Medicaid costs--a gap that leaders hope the economy closes before the 2013 Legislature confronts budgetary issues. The budget also gives school districts $4 billion less than what they would have gotten under existing funding formulas intended to cover enrollment growth. All told, the budgeted $53.83 billion in public education spending tops--by .2 percent--the $53.7 billion budgeted for public education the previous two years, according to Legislative Budget Board summaries. That $125.2 million increase derives from a $3 billion increase in state spending on public education minus a nearly $2.8 billion decrease in federal spending. So, total spending is going down $15 billion and public education spending is (narrowly) up. Anything missing from this picture? Lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include an alliance of big school districts, told us that while Sullivan’s figures hold up, the implication that schools stand to gain from this budget is incorrect, given that districts will get $4 billion less than they were due under existing law. We asked Sullivan, president of Empower Texans, a group advocating limited government and less taxation, how he characterizes that $4 billion difference. He replied by email: "So many numbers tossed around by so many folks about so many things, I could not possibly characterize something so vague . . . How one might wish to characterize those (not enough, too much, just right) is outside this discussion about my tweet noting that the new budget DOES have more dollars in it than the last for public education at the same time over all spending is being cut." Historical note: Four of the five previous budgets signed into law by Perry included increases in public school funding. And unlike the 2012-13 budget awaiting his consideration, all five budgets gave schools the aid due them based on state funding formulas. According to the budget board, the overall public education two-year funding increases were 2 percent in 2002-03, 3.3 percent in 2004-05, 7.5 percent in 2006-07 and 34 percent in 2008-09. Funding dipped .9 percent in 2010-11. Spending on public education is higher in the pending budget than the current one. But Sullivan’s implication--that Texas schools are sitting pretty--obscures reality. The new budget doesn’t cover projected enrollment growth. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04652	Says he and Mitt Romney "always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline" for leaving Afghanistan.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-romney-has-always-supported-2014-af/	With Mitt Romney taking heat for not mentioning Afghanistan in his convention speech, vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan sought to clarify the Republican plan for ending America’s longest war. President Barack Obama increased troops there in 2010 in order to overwhelm al-Qaida and strengthen and train Afghan security forces. The drawdown of that troop surge began this summer. Obama plans a full withdrawal -- and an end to the war -- in 2014. That’s one point where Ryan said the Republican ticket agrees with Obama. "We've always said that we agree with the 2014 deadline. We've always agreed with where we are headed on Afghanistan on 2014," Ryan said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 9, 2012. "But where we've taken issue is making sure that the generals on the ground get the resources they need throughout the entire fighting season so that they can keep our soldiers safe and operating counterinsurgency strategy. And I fear that this is not what's happening. I fear that there have been more political decisions made in troop strengths during this fighting season. "And so we beg to differ with the president on parts of his Afghanistan policy. But we support the 2014 deadline." The end of the decade long conflict is a key point in the fight against terrorism, and Democrats have criticized Romney for waffling on Afghanistan. We thought we’d check Romney's past statements and see if he’s consistently agreed with the timetable set by his opponent. What he said One of last year’s Republican primary debates focused on national security. There, Romney expressed clear support for the 2014 deadline. "The timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces," he said in the Nov. 13, 2011, debate. More recently, at a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, Romney again said it’s his goal "to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014." But he also added, as he has numerous other times, that he would "evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders" when making decisions about American troops. A few days later, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked if that was a shift in position. "No, it's the same posture I've had all along," Romney said, "which is that I believe that the right target for us is to withdraw our troops by the end of 2014. At the same time in the speech I gave at the VFW, I said I would however also want to consult with commanders on the ground to make sure that that time line was still the appropriate time line and that is something, which I will continue to point out." An interview he gave on PBS NewsHour in October 2011 also indicated a soft commitment to the 2014 timetable. Host Judy Woodruff said, "There is an agreement between NATO, the United States and Afghanistan that all foreign troops would be out by 2014. If you're president, would you abide by that agreement?" Romney answered: "I would listen to the generals. And if that continues to be the view of the ... commanders in the field as they assess the capabilities of the Afghan military, then of course I would pursue that course." It's clear that Ryan was speaking for the Romney/Ryan ticket in his This Week interview. But we also looked for his own comments on the war. An op-ed, written shortly after he visited Afghanistan, reflected general support for the 2014 timetable while leaving open the possibility of a longer-term commitment: "A transition plan is in place for Afghan forces to take control of the country's security in 2014," Ryan wrote. "Even as we work toward that point, it is important to remember that our nation's commitment to Afghanistan isn't likely to end there. Our nation's troops and resources will continue to support the Afghan people for years to come - not to engage in nation-building, but to mitigate the risk posed by the region's extremists to our own national security." An even earlier withdrawal? At times, Romney has suggested a pullout might be possible before 2014. At a June debate in New Hampshire: "It's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes to our generals that we can hand the country over to the ... Afghan military to defend themselves from the Taliban." And at an August town hall, also in New Hampshire: "I will do everything in my power to transition from our military to their military as soon as possible, bring our men and women home and do so in a way consistent with our mission, which is to keep Afghanistan from being overrun by a new entity that would allow Afghanistan to be a launching point for terror again like it was on 9/11." Criticizing Obama Romney has offered scant agreement with anything else Obama has done on the war front. His most pointed criticism centered on the 2014 deadline, but Romney objected to Obama’s public announcement of the withdrawal date, not the date itself. In his speech announcing his current White House run, Romney said it was "wrong" to announce a withdrawal date. When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta laid out a plan in early 2012 for the transition of U.S. troops from a combat role to a support role, Romney’s condemnation was harsh. "He announced that. So the Taliban hears it, the Pakistanis hear it, the Afghan leaders hear it," Romney said. "Why in the world do you go to the people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops? It makes absolutely no sense." "His naivete is putting in jeopardy the mission of the United States of America and our commitments to freedom," he said. "He is wrong. We need new leadership in Washington." The Obama campaign counters that Romney’s plans for Afghanistan lack specificity, a complaint we noted in several stories, including from some Republicans. Our ruling Ryan claimed that he and Romney have "always agreed" with the 2014 timetable for withdrawing from Afghanistan. We found numerous instances where Romney expressed support for that deadline. His criticism was not of the date itself but the announcement of it, which he said emboldened the Taliban and endangered troops. But Romney also has said a troop withdrawal would be conditional on what the situation on the ground is -- an important caveat that could leave him room to ignore the deadline. Ryan’s statement was accurate but for that one detail. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-09-11T18:09:18	2012-09-09	['Afghanistan']
pomt-09674	A small business receiving a federal tax credit "to provide health care for its employees ... would be barred under the Stupak Amendment from allowing their employees to use ... the health care that they offer them for abortion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/18/ed-rendell/rendell-says-small-businesses-receiving-health-ins/	An amendment to the House health care bill continues to inspire political passions, driving a wedge between abortion-rights supporters who are outraged at what they consider a major loss for women's rights, and Democratic lawmakers who fear seeing their long-awaited health care reform effort stalled due to the debate. The amendment -- a last-minute addition that passed, 240-194, with support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats -- establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the health care bill's insurance "exchanges." These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to feasibly offer health coverage to their employees. Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the "public option," which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. However, the amendment does allow people in the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still purchase an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. But in a Nov. 12 appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show , Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, added a new layer of concern for abortion-rights advocates. Rendell said that in addition to erecting hurdles for individuals who receive federal subsidies, the amendment would also make it harder to secure abortion coverage if you happen to work for a company that gets federal subsidies. "Take a small business that's receiving a tax credit, a federal tax credit, to provide health care for its employees," Rendell said. "They would be barred under the Stupak Amendment from allowing their employees to use their -- the health care that they offer them for abortion. They would be absolutely disallowed from doing that." Let's start by looking at the small-business subsidy Rendell is referring to. According to Section 521 of the House health care bill, small businesses can receive federal tax credits for providing employees with health coverage. The tax credit would be equal to half the amount paid by the employer for health coverage, though the law also sets limits based on the size of the company and the average wages. It also says that companies can only receive the credit for two years. The amendment clearly states that government funds cannot be used to pay for abortion coverage. So it seems to us -- and experts we spoke to agreed -- that just as subsidized individuals cannot buy a full plan that covers abortion, a small business receiving the credits could not purchase a plan that includes abortion coverage. To a degree, then, Rendell is right: The amendment would affect people on the exchange if their company received health care subsidies, even if they paid their share of the premium entirely out of their own pocket and they did not personally receive subsidies from the government. However, Rendell left out an important factor. Just as individuals who receive subsidies can still purchase abortion riders on the exchange, so too can individuals who work for a small business that receives tax credits. In addition, our experts said that nothing in the legislation would stop companies from offering abortion riders for their employees; the funds would need to be paid out of the employees' pockets, not the company's. Such a process already occurs in some of the states that have laws on the books that are similar to the Stupak amendment. We give Rendell credit for noting the often overlooked impact the amendment would have on abortion options for employees of subsidized small businesses. He's right that the company cannot simply offer a single, comprehensive health care plan that includes abortion. But both the individuals and the companies in question can purchase separate riders that cover abortion, which suggests that the term "absolutely disallowed" is inaccurate. This may be cold comfort to abortion-rights advocates, who are generally skeptical of the value of riders, saying that companies may not offer them and that individuals may not purchase them. But it earns Rendell a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03291	"The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/01/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-red-light-cameras-change-driver/	Hopefuls for St. Petersburg mayor are divided on the city’s red light camera program. Mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford argued in her response to a Tampa Bay Times questionnaire that the city’s technology is flawed, the cost to appeal is "prohibitively high" and unfair, and the program should be stopped. Mayor Bill Foster, who pushed for the cameras, still supports them. Mayoral candidate Rick Kriseman aligns with Foster. "I support them for the purposes of public safety, not as a revenue generator. ... The fact is that red light cameras change driver behavior and cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents," Kriseman wrote. We wanted to know if Kriseman’s point is accurate. St. Petersburg’s program The cameras seem to be just about everywhere. St. Petersburg is one of about 70 municipalities in Florida with red light cameras, along with five other cities in Pinellas County, Tampa, Miami, Clearwater and Orlando. About half of U.S. states have authorized the technology in the past two decades. The St. Petersburg program started in fall 2011 with cameras at 10 intersections. Tickets for running a red light are $158. (Locations here.) Already the cameras have been at the brink of wipeout, having survived a few City Council votes that would effectively end the program. A number of municipalities have had buyer’s remorse. In Houston, a voter referendum killed the program. Collier County (Fla.) commissioners voted to kill their program in December 2012 because they did not find evidence that the cameras reduced accidents. Los Angeles officials ended the program there after realizing it was difficult to pursue violators who ignored their tickets. An audit found the cameras did not improve public safety. Still, other cities tout benefits. More than a year in, the question remains for St. Pete: Are the cameras reducing the most dangerous crashes? A consultant’s performance report in December 2012 concluded that the red light crash rate fell by 31 percent at St. Petersburg traffic approaches with cameras from November 2011 to October 2012, compared to the three-year average preceding it. Crashes from red light running resulting in injury fell by 47 percent compared to the three-year average preceding the program, the consultants found. But the lengthy report omitted facts later reported by the Tampa Bay Times, such as the fact that rear-end wrecks at intersections with red light cameras jumped 44 percent and overall crashes at those intersections increased 10 percent compared to the previous year. Interpretations all depend on how you dice the data, said Michael Frederick, the city’s transportation manager. The consultant compared the first year of traffic data with a three-year average instead of data just for the year before. A more in-depth review is expected after three years with the cameras, he said. Not included in the report? Fatal crashes. Frederick said that’s because there were none in the year examined. University of South Florida researchers found that St. Pete averaged about one fatal crash a year in the years before the cameras went up. Many studies, many findings Both sides of the camera debate tout a plethora of research espousing their opinions. Kriseman’s campaign manager said he was talking about the effect of red light cameras in general on motorist behavior and dangerous crashes. The campaign sent materials from national pro-camera groups, the National Coalition for Safer Roads and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (funded by auto insurance companies), in addition to a study that appeared in The Journal of Trauma in 2010. We’ll sum up that research, as well as a couple others. • The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety asserts red light cameras reduce the most dangerous crashes, pointing to 2011 in-house research that found large cities with red light cameras between 2004-08 saw a 24 percent reduction in fatal red light running crashes compared to those without. The institute also points to a 2002 study in California, showing significant declines in injury crashes and right-angle injury crashes across the city after some intersections got cameras. • The Journal of Trauma study examined driver behavior for nine months at a dangerous intersection in a New Orleans suburb. The report concluded the cameras decreased the rate of red-light running and had a "lasting effect on driver behavior." The study, however, said the cameras did not seem to prevent collisions at the intersection, recommending more studies over more time. • The Texas Transportation Institute of Texas A&M University examined crash records at 275 intersections in Texas cities with red light cameras. The researchers concluded that the most severe crashes, those at right angles, dropped 32 percent. Another study is planned this fall to examine what happened to crashes in cities that took down their red light cameras. • A 2004 study by the Urban Transit Institute at North Carolina A&T State University concluded no demonstrable safety benefit from red light cameras. "There isn’t a conclusive study that would say that in all circumstances that red light cameras are going to provide the safety benefits that they’re looking at," said Jason Bittner, director of USF’s Center for Urban Transportation Research. "It’s kind of on a case-by-case basis." More research Three USF researchers reviewed seven red light camera studies held up by the federal government as the best designed studies and found none concluded a statistical safety benefit from the cameras. They noted several government-funded studies actually stated injury or severe crashes increased with the cameras, according to their 2011 paper in Florida Public Health Review. The professors, who became interested in the cameras years ago because a portion of the revenue goes to trauma center hospitals, pointed out in 2011 that red light cameras often have a "double effect" on motorists: They are put at higher risk for fines and rear-end crashes. The researchers objected to the IIHS California study and others for not using scientific research methods, and have faulted other research for not taking into account traffic trends, such as the fact that the state has been seeing a decrease in red light running, said Barbara Langland Orban, a USF health policy professor. The professors agree that red light cameras influence driver behavior -- just not for the better (though they had not seen studies of psychological effects of the cameras on drivers). "There’s a difference between a driver being more aware and a driver being more skittish," said Etienne Pracht, a USF professor of health care economics. We turned to another local camera critic. Matt Florell, who runs StPeteCameras.org, analyzed more than 20 North American red light camera studies published in academic journals or cited by government agencies and determined most of them showed an increase in total crashes with red light cameras installed. In the 15 studies that measured crashes with injury, there was an increase of 21 percent, Florell found. Florell is highly critical of the city’s one-year report, saying it cherry-picks statistics, lacks raw numbers and makes unproven assumptions. Our ruling Kriseman’s point is not new: Many supporters of red light cameras tout, as he did, that benefits include changed motorist behavior and reducing the most dangerous kind of crashes. We found some studies that say cameras changed motorist behavior -- by either putting them on high alert or teaching them a lesson. But whether they truly "cut down on the most dangerous types of accidents" remains a matter of much debate. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-12786	"Your politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs. That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/feb/17/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-paints-fellow-republicans-job-kille/	Gov. Rick Scott is painting fellow Republicans as job-killers for their support of a bill that would decimate the state’s agencies for tourism promotion and business incentives. Scott has escalated his feud with House Speaker Richard Corcoran by calling out legislators on their own turf for votes in committee to dismantle Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida. Scott credits these two groups for helping usher 1.2 million private-sector jobs into the state since he was elected. In his view, a vote to eliminate the agencies is a vote against jobs. At a stop of the "Fighting for Florida’s Jobs" tour in Flagler Beach, Scott targeted the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast. "Your politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs," Scott said Feb. 13 to business leaders and constituents at Vessel Sandwich Co. "That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said." Scott continued, "He said, 'I will sponsor the bill to eliminate marketing for tourists.' He sponsored the bill to do that and to get rid of Visit Florida." Scott is using the jobs argument a lot lately (though not for the employees who work at the agencies). • "When they want to say we don’t want to do any more marketing for Visit Florida, what they are saying is that we don’t need any more jobs in tourism." (Miami Herald) • "It’s pretty clear, if you’re not caring about people’s jobs you must be caring about something else," he said. "I care about people’s jobs. What else can it be?" (Miami Herald) • "How can anybody say they don’t want to help a poor family get a job?" (Miami Herald) His attack against Renner misrepresents Renner's view. There is no record of Renner saying exactly that his area doesn't need more jobs. Scott press secretary Kerri Wyland said Scott’s point is focused on the effect of Renner’s proposal. "By choosing to sponsor this job-killing legislation, Rep. Renner is telling families in the counties he serves that the area does not need more jobs," she said. Renner doesn’t see the legislation as a crusade against jobs. He jokingly offered $100 to anyone who heard those words come out of his mouth. When he introduced the bill, Renner brought up a philosophical difference with Scott about the fairness of economic incentives, arguing the money could be better spent to benefit more people. "We should be taking the hundreds of millions of dollars we’re spending on the privileged few — those few companies that are able to navigate the system — for broad-based tax reform," Renner said Feb. 8 at the House Careers and Competition Subcommittee meeting. "Tax reform that benefits all businesses, small, medium and large, and if we do that we will continue to be one of the leading states in the country for job growth." In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Renner said he prefers tax money to be invested in public safety, infrastructure and education — not marketing campaigns (see "Sexy Beaches") or incentives. He’s also disappointed in executives for awarding bonuses and increasing salaries of executives with state dollars. As for the jobs situation in Renner's area, the unemployment rate for Flagler County (home to Flagler Beach and Renner's Palm Coast) has been slightly higher than the state average but not alarmingly so. In December 2016, the Florida rate was 4.9 percent, compared with 5.4 percent (preliminary) in Flagler. That's down from the county's 12.3 percent rate in December 2010, before Scott took office. Scott may be hoping the legislation is a turnoff in Renner’s district, but he has some competition from the other side. Americans For Prosperity Florida started mailing fliers to Renner’s constituents, urging them to continue to support Renner’s efforts to dismantle a "rigged" system. And on Feb. 15, a video was posted on the Florida House of Representatives YouTube page. It uses clips of news reports about failed projects and ends with President Ronald Reagan. "I am sure he was speaking figuratively when he said that we're not in favor of jobs," Renner said of Scott. "The Florida House is full of people who believe in jobs and prosperity for everyone." Our ruling Scott said, "Politicians in Tallahassee today are saying, in your area, that they don't need any more jobs. That is exactly what Rep. Paul Renner said." That is not exactly what Renner said, and it misleads voters about the issue. Renner supports legislation to eliminate funding for Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which Scott says will cost Florida jobs -- ergo, Renner supports losing jobs. Renner, naturally, sees it differently. He thinks the money would be better devoted to tax cuts. The picture is far more complex than the broad brush Scott paints.

pomt-04443	Says Obama was in New York City the same day as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but went on a TV show instead of meeting with him.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-obama-was-nyc-same-say-bibi-dissed-/	President Barack Obama couldn’t manage to squeeze in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while they were in New York on the same day, but Obama did find time to go on a TV talk show, charged vice presidential candidate U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., during a debate on Oct. 11. Here is what Ryan said: "Let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see? They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. They're spinning the centrifuges faster. "They see us saying when we come into the administration, when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally, Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is and he, instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show." Ryan was referring to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York that occurred the last week of September; both Obama and Netanyahu attended. But were Obama and Netanyahu at the U.N. meeting the same day, and did Obama ditch the prime minister for a TV talk show instead? Scheduling problems First, some background on the much talked about a meeting that didn’t happen between the two leaders. The controversy over the allegedly missed meeting started Sept. 11, 2012, when the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the White House declined Israel’s request for a meeting during the U.N. conference. "An official in Jerusalem said that the Prime Minister's Office sent the White House a message stating that although Netanyahu will spend only two and a half days on U.S. soil, he is interested in meeting Obama and is willing to travel to the U.S. capital specifically for that purpose. The official added that the White House rejected the request and said that at this time Obama's schedule does not allow for a meeting." We fact-checked a claim by a Romney campaign surrogate, South Florida congressional candidate Adam Hasner, that "President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York." We ruled that claim Mostly True. We found several news stories -- based on anonymous sources -- that said Netanyahu’s team asked for a meeting between the two leaders and was rejected. The White House responded on the record that the leaders couldn’t meet due to scheduling conflicts. The controversy led the two men to speak by telephone for an hour the night of Sept. 11. Let’s look at when the two leaders were in New York during the week of Sept. 24. Obama was in the city on Monday and Tuesday. He taped the interview with The View on Monday and addressed the U.N. on Tuesday Wednesday was the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Netanyahu planned to be in New York on Thursday and Friday. When Netanyahu spoke to the U.N. on Thursday, Sept. 27, he asked the U.N. to draw "a clear red line" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The New York Times wrote: "In a theatrical gesture, Netanyahu held up a cartoon-like drawing of a spherical bomb and drew a red line below the fuse, "before Iran completes the second stage of nuclear enrichment to make a bomb," he said. Netanyahu met with Hillary Clinton on Thursday. On Friday, he spoke with both Obama and Romney by telephone, the Jerusalem Post reported. Netanyahu left New York on Saturday. The Los Angeles Times reported that "the absence of face time with world leaders was glaring. Obama held 13 meetings with leaders at last year’s meeting, according to CBS Radio’s Mark Knoller, the unofficial White House stat keeper." The article stated that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was slated to handle the one-on-one diplomacy including a meeting with Netanyahu. The View Obama and first lady Michelle Obama taped an appearance on ABC’s The View at studios in Manhattan on the afternoon of Monday, Sept. 24, and it aired Sept. 25, according to a pool press report that day. Much of the interview was light-hearted -- some questions about the Obamas’ marriage, a mention of one of his daughters playing tennis. They discussed that they would celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first debate and held hands during most of the taping, according to the pool report. But Obama also touched on serious topics including his campaign, the economy and Libya. Obama’s critics attacked him for going on the show. Fox News’ headline on commentary by a Republican strategist was: "Obama picks ‘The View’ over foreign policy." "As world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Obama and the first lady gathered with the women of the daytime talk show,’The View,’ sadly choosing show business over the business of foreign relations. Leadership is about priorities, what does this say about the priorities of our president?" stated the column by Alice Stewart, a Romney and Republican National Committee surrogate. To be clear, though, Netanyahu was not in New York on Monday, the day Obama taped The View. News reports indicate he left Israel on Wednesday, after Yom Kippur. Our ruling During the debate Ryan said that Obama was in New York City the same day as Netanyahu and "instead of meeting with him, goes on a daily talk show." The two leaders were not there on the same day: Obama was there Monday and Tuesday, and Netanyahu was there later in the week, on Thursday and Friday. Obama taped The View on Monday.

pomt-12624	"...the earth moves closer to the sun every year – you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/31/scott-wagner/pa-gopers-climate-change-theory-debunked-nope-not-/	Republican Pa. Sen. Scott Wagner believes that climate change is probably happening. He also says he believes some of that change is "manmade," too. But Wagner, a state senator from York in the midst of a run for governor, seemed this week to cite a more celestial reason why things are getting a little warmer while he was laying out policy proposals related to natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry. "I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth," Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. "We’re moving closer to the sun." He added, "We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can." The Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change? Let’s start with the, er, "manmade" option first: Despite Wagner’s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth’s greenhouse effect. Dave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University’s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is "absurd." He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was "off by literally a factor of a million." Wagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth "moves closer to the sun every year," but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence. Donald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said "on average, we aren’t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously." Technically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That’s because the Earth doesn’t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it’s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn’t have an impact on climate change "on human time scales," repeats every year. Schneider also noted that Wagner cited "the rotation of the Earth" when he said the Earth is moving closer to the sun, but he likely meant "the revolution" or the orbit of the Earth. The Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year. "The Earth moves closer to the sun every year, that can be technically true in a narrow definition," Schneider said. "Half the time it is. In the context of the Earth moving closer to the sun causing the temperature to go up, I don’t think is correct." Goldberg agreed, saying he’s "kind of disappointed in [Wagner’s] high school science teacher." "This idea that something that happens on a one-year time scale has anything to do with what we’re seeing in terms of global warming is a ridiculous argument," Goldberg said, adding that it’s "insulting" Wagner would insinuate scientists hadn’t considered the impact of the Earth’s proximity to the sun. PolitiFact Pennsylvania reached out to Wagner’s office in search of evidence of his claim. His office released a statement from Wagner instead, in which he said: "I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that." "However, the real question isn't is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it," he said in the statement. "I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy." Our Ruling Pennsylvania Sen. Scott Wagner said during a discussion about climate change that "the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun." The Earth technically does move closer to the sun every year as part of its revolution around the sun, but it then moves back. That revolution is not related to the rotation of the Earth, and as experts point out, the Earth isn’t on average moving closer to the sun. That movement closer to the sun, scientists say, wouldn’t have an impact on climate change, and one scientist even called the claim "ridiculous." Also, there’s no evidence to suggest human body heat is at all related to global climate change. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08375	Says PolitiFact says Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/oct/25/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/anti-amendment-4-group-cites-politifact-newspaper-/	The group opposing Amendment 4, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, placed a full page ad in the Oct. 17, 2010, Orlando Sentinel urging voters to vote no on the amendment based on information from, well, us. The full page ad ran with the headline "What does Amendment 4 really mean for Florida?" Included in the ad was an allegation that listed PolitiFact as the source. The ad says Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees." The footnote attached to the claim points back to a PolitiFact Florida article from March 16, 2010. We love the publicity and notoriety that comes with being quoted in a full page advertisement running in one of the state's largest newspapers. But we love being quoted accurately more. In this case, we weren't. First, in case you don't know, here's some background on Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: "Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice." Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils, county commissions or appointed local planning agencies. Supporters argue that the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida. We've rated several claims on both sides of Amendment 4, which you can see here. The claim we're analyzing in this case stems from a statement we examined in the spring. Back in March, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claimed that the tiny Pinellas community of St. Pete Beach had terrible experiences with its own version of Amendment 4, resulting in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate." We found two half truths in the statement back then. 1). We didn't agree that Amendment 4 and St. Pete Beach's version of hometown democracy were the same thing. Here's what we wrote about the comparison then: "A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years. "That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid. "But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass." 2). We didn't think St. Pete Beach's hometown democracy rule generated lawsuits that forced the city to raise its property tax rate. Declining property values, more than anything else, forced the tax rate increase in 2009. Here's what we wrote then: "Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department (during budget talks). Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees." Our ruling Let's look at what Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy said again in its ad. Citing PolitiFact, it said Amendment 4 "will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees." Well, we can speak unequivocally about this one. PolitiFact Florida never said that what happened in St. Pete Beach's case will happen in cities and counties across Florida if Amendment 4 is approved. We never said it in any other Truth-O-Meter items either. And even ignoring that, PolitiFact Florida never said St. Pete Beach's local hometown democracy rules forced the city to raise its tax rate. No doubt about it: Pants on Fire! (And no footnote required). UPDATE: Ryan Houck, a spokesman for Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, said the line in the Sentinel ad was mistakenly sourced to PolitiFact. "Over the course of this campaign, we’ve generated literally thousands of documents containing accurate claims and citations — we’ve always prided ourselves on an attention to detail and a focus on the facts," he said. "However, sometimes mistakes happen and I’m sorry to say that one has happened here." Houck said that the ad should have referenced Florida TaxWatch as the source for the ad’s claim.

pomt-01012	"Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/02/phil-kerpen/claim-mitch-mcconnell-has-already-allowed-more-ame/	There’s a new sheriff in charge of the U.S. Senate, and he’s eager to show how he’s shaking up the law of the land. We’re talking, of course, about new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who took over the Senate’s top slot after the midterm elections bounced Democrats from power. And in this new world, Republicans are touting an eye-catching factoid as evidence of a functional Senate, one they say runs on fairness and order under GOP control. "Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year," tweeted Phil Kerpen, opinion-writer and president of conservative 501(c)(4) American Commitment, on Jan. 22, 2015. Kerpen, formerly of Americans for Prosperity, the Club for Growth and the libertarian Cato Institute, told us he heard the statistic from McConnell himself. We wanted to know if it was true that the Senate has already allowed more votes on amendments in less than one month than all of 2014. And why? On Senate stoppage and filled ‘trees’ The simple answer on the number of votes is that Kerpen is correct. But the reason behind it varies depending on your particular political lens. A simple search of Senate roll call votes on amendments in 2014 and 2015 backs up Kerpen’s statement. In 2014, there were 15 roll call votes on amendments. As of Jan. 22, 2015, the date of Kerpen's tweet, there were 16 roll call votes on amendments. There have since been 17 more votes on amendments to the bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which passed a week later but will likely face President Barack Obama’s veto pen. Kerpen came at the tally a different way, counting "real" votes on amendments, a distinction that also includes roll call votes on motions to table amendments, which effectively kills them. By his math, there were 16 votes allowed on amendments in 2014 and 26 so far in 2015. By either count, the numbers work. What changed? In 2014, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., relied on a funny-sounding procedure called "filling the amendment tree." Basically, Reid filled the docket allowed for amendments by adding amendments with inconsequential changes that no one else could override. The procedural tactic prevented Republican-sponsored amendments from being heard on the floor. "He did that more than any of his predecessors," Donald Ritchie, Senate historian, told PunditFact. Reid wasn’t doing this just to be a not-so-nice guy. To Democrats, it was to counter Republican tactics. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have strict rules for the substance of amendments that can be attached to bills (i.e., you could add a health care amendment onto a defense spending bill). And that’s exactly what happened in years past. Republicans began introducing off-topic amendments that, for example, cut off U.S. aid to Egypt or, a favorite of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to eliminate health care subsidies for Senate staffers. No matter what the topic of the bill. Sometimes this was in effort to force difficult votes for Democrats back home. To Republicans, Reid’s style of blocking amendments emulated an uncooperative and off-the-rails leadership style -- one that is tremendously well-documented -- that stymied policymaking. To Democrats, it was necessary to get anything accomplished. Republicans were filibustering votes on the underlying bills and not committing to a vote in exchange for allowing some amendments, said Steven S. Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "Reid saw they were filibustering everything, bringing the place to a standstill," Smith told us. "So he wondered why he should give them votes at all." Reid’s office does not dispute the number of votes on amendments, but they do take issue with what they deem an "empty talking point" that neglects Republican responsibility for the gridlock. His spokesman argues that Republicans blocked their own share of amendments by not compromising on potential amendments to be heard on the floor and refusing to come to an agreement about when a bill should come to a vote. "(Reid) makes no apologies for blocking what we all consider to be extremely pointless political amendments that were just designed not to improve the bills we were working on but to run 30-second political ads against Democratic senators," said spokesman Adam Jentleson. "Republicans are entirely culpable in that number being what it is." Reid’s style of blocking amendments irritated Republicans, sure, but it also flared up during the 2014 midterms with Republicans using it to attack Democrats. The GOP pounced on Alaska Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, for instance, for his lack of roll-call votes on his amendments. McConnell, conversely, said he would allow open amendments on the Keystone XL bill, hence the GOP celebrating its "new management" style. As political experts told us to expect, there have already been clashes with McConnell’s methods a few days after the initial celebration. During the Keystone debate, Democrats objected to McConnell tabling Democratic amendments and not letting Democrats debate their amendments for a minute. Reid, perhaps ironically, tweeted, "I've never seen debate shut down as aggressively as when Sen. McConnell refused to allow Dems to debate their own amendments for just 1 min. ... and that’s saying something." What the experts tell us Bottom line, experts said, voters shouldn’t take the new tactics as evidence that McConnell’s "return to normal order" will give the Democrats an easy path to voting on the amendments of their choice. "It’s not going to happen," said Roy Meyers, University of Maryland, Baltimore County affiliate professor of public policy. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis agreed, saying, "The overall idea isn’t trivial (‘regular order’), but the exact number isn’t very significant, especially if McConnell, as expected, runs the Senate almost completely to the (Republicans’) advantage." It’s too early to know whether we have a "sea change" of order on our hands in the Senate, said Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. "In other words, the intense partisanship of the Senate that led Sen. Reid to all-but shut down the amendment process last year has not dissipated," Binder said. "I think the question going forward is whether McConnell can find a way to conduct the Senate such that senators from both parties believe their legislative needs are being met." Our ruling Kerpen, among others, tweeted, "Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than (Harry) Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year." On the numbers, that is right. But experts cautioned us that the claim falls more in the interesting factoid category than a sign of a different or more cooperative Senate leadership. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check incorrectly described Sen. David Vitter's amendment.	None	Phil Kerpen	None	None	None	2015-02-02T17:07:41	2015-01-22	['None']
pomt-05895	"Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion... every year."	false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/06/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-online-piracy-and-counterfeiting-/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, declared in an opinion column on CNN.com: "The growing number of foreign websites that offer counterfeit or stolen goods continues to threaten American technology, products and jobs." His Jan. 20, 2012, post continues: "Illegal counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion and thousands of jobs every year. Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while some of America's most profitable and productive industries are under attack." Say what costs that much? A reader asked. Smith’s $100 billion statement has weaknesses, we learned, partly because estimates of the impact of online vending of counterfeit or pirated (as in stolen) software, movies, recordings and other rip-off products ranging from handbags to shoes are hard to corral. We’ll dip into Smith’s backup after some background. Smith is a chief sponsor of the stalled Stop Online Piracy Act, which he described in a November 2011 Austin American-Statesman oped column as an attempt to rein in "a vast virtual market online run by criminals who steal and sell America's intellectual property and keep the profits for themselves." "Movies and music are not the only stolen products that are offered by rogue sites," Smith’s column says. "Counterfeit medicine, automotive parts and even baby food are a big part of the counterfeiting business and pose a serious threat to the health of American consumers." Smith’s November column says too that the act is intended to target such illegal activity by permitting the attorney general to seek an injunction against a foreign website dedicated to it. Congressional action on Smith’s proposal, and a Senate approach pitched as protecting intellectual property, stalled out in the wake of a public outcry in January. Now let’s get back to Smith’s claim that counterfeiting and piracy costs the U.S. economy $100 billion a year. His spokeswoman, Sally-Shannon Birkel, told us Smith’s figure originated in a February 2011 report commissioned by the France-based Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy, an initiative of the International Chamber of Commerce, whose declared mission is to promote trade and investment, open markets and the free flow of capital. The report says: "We find that the U.S. consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods is between $66 billion and $100 billion (based on 2008 data)." So that’s the origin of Smith’s $100 billion figure. It’s the high-end part of this finding. Globally, the same report says, such goods had a 2008 value of up to $650 billion. But Smith’s statement refers to how much counterfeiting and online piracy costs the U.S. economy. Is the country’s "consumption-based share" of such goods -- which the report calls relevant to U.S. businesses -- the same as their cost to the economy? It’s unlikely. A portion of the report pointed out to us by Sanjay Jain, a Texas A&M University professor of marketing, states that the "study has not attempted to estimate business losses associated with counterfeiting and piracy. This is primarily because the likely variations and other difficulties associated with estimating substitution effects across substantially different countries and industries introduces an additional level/degree of variables which could undermine our aim to as accurately as possible characterize the magnitude of counterfeiting and piracy." After presenting the $66 billion to $100 billion range, the report says this represents "international trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, domestically produced and consumed goods and digitally pirated products." Broken down, the report says, this includes consumption of $45 billion to $60 billion of internationally traded counterfeit and pirated products, $12 billion to $14 billion in domestically produced counterfeit products and between $9 billion and $25 billion in digitally pirated products. Jain and Julian Sanchez, a fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has urged skepticism about cost estimates for online piracy, each pointed out to us that the presented range questionably assumes that any pirated product would otherwise be purchased at its retail price by the person who obtained it. That’s not always or even often so, they said. Broadly speaking, Jain said, he has seen no convincing studies on the costs of piracy and counterfeiting to the American economy — unsurprisingly so, he said, because it’s not an easy problem. "I don’t know the right number," he said. Sanchez, who told us he considers Smith’s proposal a "bad bill," raised another issue, saying by email that most of the pirated and counterfeited products included in the its $66 billion to $100 billion range have nothing to do with online piracy targeted by Smith’s act. "People were manufacturing fake Nikes long before the Internet became a mass medium," Sanchez wrote, "so while it might be an interesting factoid to know the size of that market, it’s a red herring if we’re talking about a ‘Stop Online Piracy Act.’" This "whole debate," Sanchez said, "has tended to lump together ‘counterfeiting’ (trademark infringement, usually involving physical goods) and ‘piracy’ (copyright infringement, encompassing both physical media sales and online digital transfers). From a policy perspective, this is misleading, if not outright deceptive. Whatever amount is spent globally on fake Nikes imported in bulk by retailers, it has very little to do with the debate over policy aimed at shutting down cyberlockers to reduce illicit downloads by individual consumers. You might as well cite an estimate of the total economic cost of ‘crime.’ " The debate aside, we asked Jeffrey Hardy, director of the international chamber’s initiative, if its report’s $66 billion to $100 billion estimate for the United States’ "consumption-based share" for counterfeit and pirated goods is the same as the economic impact of such activities on the country’s economy. It’s not, Hardy said, though he said the cost to the economy would be a percentage of the $66 billion to $100 billion "share." He also stressed that the report’s figures reflected the situation in 2008 and costs have increased since then. His speculation: "We may already be to $166 billion" for the U.S. share of consumed counterfeit and pirated goods, which could even turn out to be the current annual cost to the economy. Hardy also confirmed that the range presented in the report is tied to the retail value of goods though, he agreed, it’s incorrect to assume that in all cases someone who purchases a pirated or counterfeit good would otherwise buy the product at market cost. All told, Hardy acknowledged, there was no way to pinpoint costs to the economy. The main point was to show that counterfeiting and digital piracy are big problems. "There is a balance between overhyping or overcooking the pie … and trying to present the fact that the magnitudes are enormous and getting bigger, especially on the digital side of things," Hardy said. "It’s a very complicated process when there’s not a lot of information and (there is) a lot of educated guesses. That’s what economists do." Hardy said the international chamber has taken no position on SOPA. Separately, Sanchez said he agrees with an April 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which states that while counterfeiting and online piracy may pose sizeable negative economic effects, they are hard to quantify. A GAO summary of the report, "Intellectual Property, Observations on Efforts to Quantify the Economic Effects of Counterfeit and Pirated Goods," says: "Generally, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of (intellectual property) infringements extremely difficult, so assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts." After we summarized much of this research, Smith objected to Sanchez as an expert, saying in an email that because Sanchez is opposed to the anti-online-piracy act, he "cannot provide an objective or unbiased analysis." He stood by his CNN.com statement, telling us: "Since the U.S. is the largest producer of (intellectual property) that is consumed around the world, one can surmise that a significant amount of that total value is taken from the U.S. economy." Our ruling Smith’s statement draws on a high-end estimate also based on flawed assumptions for the U.S. "consumption-based share of counterfeit and pirated goods" in 2008. The cited $100 billion figure doesn’t reflect the costs to the economy, contrary to Smith’s claim; the 2011 study did not assess such costs, which are understandably slippery. Maybe there is no solid estimate of the cost to the economy. Smith’s CNN.com statement rates False.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2012-02-06T14:39:29	2012-01-20	['United_States']
pomt-08408	Tom Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" and "over 160 complaints in just three years."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/21/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-target-tom-ganley-citing-better-business/	Republican congressional candidate Tom Ganley is an auto giant and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation and finance companies. His success enhanced his stature as a candidate. And, it made him rich enough to help finance his campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District. Sutton, with help from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has countered by questioning the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire. Sutton's TV advertising has cited lawsuits filed against Ganley dealerships. PolitiFact Ohio examined those claims and noted that while her numbers were correct, the information was presented without context. Specifically, the ad cited large numbers of lawsuits filed against Ganley without noting that he’s been in business four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer. "Buyer Beware," a TV ad from the DCCC, added the claims that Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" and "over 160 complaints in just three years." PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine these assertions and, again, tried to put them in perspective. We started with the letter grades from the Better Business Bureau. The BBB called them "another tool to use" in choosing a business, and said that the grades are based on 17 different factors that include the time a business has been in operation and how it has handled complaints. An especially important factor is a business's responsive to complaints cited by the BBB. The BBB did give F ratings to two Ganley dealerships, primarily for failing to respond to six complaints filed against them during the bureau's "standard reporting period" of three years, and for false claims in advertising. But in the BBB’s online listings, the average grade for the 20 Ganley dealerships was a B+. That rating compared favorably to the per-store average of four other dealer groups we surveyed (Spitzer, Classic, Liberty and Cincinnati-based Joseph). The grades undergo continuing review and revision, and they have changed since the DCCC's ad. One F grade was upgraded to a B-. The second was withdrawn, replaced with "no rating" and is listed as under review. A third dealership, not rated earlier, was given an F. As for complaints, the BBB says, "There is no known industry standard for the number of complaints a business can expect. The volume of business and number of transactions may have a bearing on the number of complaints received by the BBB." Over 42 years in business, Ganley has sold 585,211 cars and served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, said Meghan Snyder, a spokeswoman for Ganley's campaign. "He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades." We found that its average of almost nine complaints per store, about three per year, was slightly higher than the average for the four other groups we looked at, and that a larger number of complaints involved "selling practices." Warning consumers about one practice, the BBB's website says that several of the dealerships may offer a "conditional delivery agreement" or "spot delivery agreement" to car buyers. Signing such an agreement permits the consumer to take the new vehicle home before financing has been approved," the BBB warns. "Although offered as a 'convenience' to consumers, these agreements can often create problems if the consumer interprets them to mean the final terms of the car purchase will be as originally promised." Those agreements led to several of the lawsuits against Ganley dealerships, such as one filed by a couple who said they took a new car home after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent. So let’s check the scorecard. The DCCC's claim that Ganley has "two F's from the Better Business Bureau" checked out. But the ad fails to note that those two grades later changed. The claim of "over 160 complaints in just three years" is accurate. Recognizing that Ganley is Ohio's largest car dealer with 20 dealerships is information not in the ad that lends it some perspective. And that the average grade for all those dealerships is a B plus is an important detail that also is missing. We rate the ad claim as Half True.

pomt-13202	Says Hillary Clinton takes "tens of millions of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/23/kellyanne-conway/do-clinton-donors-throw-gays-buildings/	Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scolded "chest beaters" for criticizing Trump’s (false) claims of voter fraud while ignoring worrying donations to Hillary Clinton’s foundation. "We respect the principles of American democracy," Conway said on Meet the Press Oct. 23, 2016. But, "if we’re so concerned about the principles of American democracy, as so many chest beaters were this week, ask Hillary Clinton why she takes tens of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings?" We wanted to fact-check Conway’s claim. We found Conway is confusing a few points. First, Clinton herself hasn’t taken donations from foreign countries, which is illegal for political candidates. The Clinton Foundation, however, has taken donations from countries that have poor records when it comes to their treatment of women and the LGBT community (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman). Second, Conway’s use of the present tense implies the Clinton Foundation continues to accept these donations, while the latest gifts came in 2014. The foundation has agreed to cease accepting foreign donations should Clinton win the presidency. And finally, same-sex relations in some of these countries is punishable by death, but they do not "throw gays off of buildings." That’s something done by ISIS, which is obviously not a Clinton Foundation donor. The donations As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clinton Foundation when Clinton was named secretary of state, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors (reported in broad ranges). The foundation has taken between $1 million and $5 million each from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. Kuwait donated between $5 million and $10 million, and Saudi Arabia between $10 million and $25 million. (Qatar’s 2022 World Cup committee gave between $250,001 and $500,000 while "Friends of Saudi Arabia", a group the New York Times reports was started by a Saudi Prince, donated between $1 million and $5 million.) The Emirati as well as part of the Saudi and Omani gifts came in 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altogether, that’s $18 million to $50 million from these countries. The donations supported the foundation's charitable efforts and the countries are considered allies of the United States. ‘Hate’ and ‘disrespect’ women Adult Saudi women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, marry or exit prison and may be required to provide consent to work or access health care, according to Human Rights Watch. They are also not allowed to drive or seek divorce. Women in the UAE also have to seek permission from a male guardian to marry and, once married, the law mandates obedience to her husband. The country does not specifically prohibit domestic violence and allows for punishment with certain conditions. In Qatar, the same provisions for marriage and obedience prevail while marital rape and domestic violence are not criminalized. Kuwait does not prohibit domestic violence, sexual harassment or marital rape. Oman bans gender-based discrimination in theory, but women are discriminated against in divorce, inheritance and child custody cases in practice. ‘Throws gays off buildings’ PolitiFact Arizona has previously reported that extramarital sex, including same-sex intercourse, is punishable by death in the UAE and for Muslims in Qatar. Men engaging in sodomy can be stoned to death and non-married men are subjected to 100 blows of the whip and one-year banishment in Saudi Arabia. They face up to seven years in prison in Kuwait. Kuwaiti law also prohibits "imitating the opposite sex in any way." Same-sex relations carry a penalty from six months to three years in Oman. But Conway’s description of gay men and women being thrown off of buildings is not accurate for these countries. It is ISIS that throws men suspected of being gay off of buildings. As a terrorist group, they cannot and have not donated to the Clinton Foundation. We asked the Trump campaign if Conway misspoke when she conflated ISIS’ actions with those countries that have donated to the Clinton Foundation. We did not hear back. Our ruling Conway said Clinton "takes tens of millions of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings." Conway is talking about donations the Clinton Foundation has taken from U.S. allies is the Middle East for humanitarian project. Her statement is exaggerated and muddles a few facts. Clinton, as a political candidate, cannot take donations from foreign countries. The Clinton Foundation has accepted $18 million to $40 million from countries that have treated women and gays harshly. The latest gifts came in 2014 and are not current as Conway implies. Furthermore, there’s no evidence that these countries have thrown gays off of buildings. Conway may have been thinking of ISIS, which has not and cannot donate to the Clinton Foundation. We rate her claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c14ef1a9-d846-49f6-91ed-f91803faf001	None	Kellyanne Conway	None	None	None	2016-10-23T16:39:08	2016-10-23	['None']
pomt-01996	Under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe" secret criminal investigation "can't talk about it."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/12/scott-walker/wisconsin-law-prohibits-anyone-who-knows-about-sec/	As questions surfaced about whether Gov. Scott Walker is trying to settle a secret John Doe criminal investigation involving his campaign, he has suggested that state law prohibits him from commenting on the case. That’s what happened on the June 1, 2014 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a weekly public affairs program aired on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee and on five other Wisconsin stations. Gousha asked the Republican governor if an attorney representing Walker and his campaign committee has been negotiating with the John Doe special prosecutor to reach a settlement. Walker gave this response: "As you know, as I've pointed out many times in the past when we've talked about this, the law's pretty clear in this state," Walker said. "Anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it. Anyone who doesn't know anything about it shouldn't talk about it. So, I've not commented on the Doe itself because I've abided by the law." Walker has made similar statements in the past, leading many to ask whether the secrecy part of the law in fact is so broad -- particularly given that others have disclosed details of the ongoing probe in the press and in public court filings. What is a John Doe? Here's a John Doe primer, based on an article for the State Bar of Wisconsin by Madison criminal defense attorney Marcus Berghahn, who has represented clients in John Doe investigations: A John Doe is "intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom." Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that the judge overseeing a John Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. The governor has been connected to two John Doe investigations. In May 2010, when Walker was the Milwaukee County executive, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, launched what would become a nearly three-year-long John Doe targeting Walker’s aides and associates. Six people, including three county executive employees, one county appointee and a major campaign contributor, were convicted of a variety of crimes. In August 2012, weeks after Walker won an historic recall election to remain in office, Chisholm opened another secret John Doe. It has focused on whether the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups illegally coordinated with Walker's campaign. Eric O'Keefe of Wisconsin Club for Growth has openly defied the secrecy order, going public with the fact that he has been subpoenaed. Now, to Walker's claim, made in connection with the second Doe -- that under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it." It’s worth noting that Walker’s "anyone who knows anything" phrasing is open to interpretation. At one extreme, a person could know something about a John Doe case by hearing about it in the news. That, of course, is much different than knowing about a Doe by virtue of being a participant in it. What the law says Asked to back up Walker's statement, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office referred our questions to Walker’s campaign, and a campaign spokeswoman declined to offer any information to back Walker’s claim. Walker’s attorney in the John Doe, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, didn't return our call. We contacted seven experts, all of whom have handled multiple John Doe cases: Berghahn and Madison defense attorneys Stephen Morgan and Stephen Meyer; Milwaukee defense attorneys Jeremy Levinson, who also handles campaign finance cases for Democrats, and Raymond Dall’Osto; University of Wisconsin Law School professor David Schultz and Marquette University Law School professor Daniel Blinka. Meyer and Berghahn are also adjunct professors at the UW Law School. Morgan and Blinka are former prosecutors. Here's what we learned about the state’s John Doe law, in terms of Doe cases done in secret: 1. Secrecy applies when so ordered As we noted, John Doe investigations can be done in public, but the Doe law allows judges to hold them in secret. And many do. When the secrecy provision is invoked, individuals who are ordered by a John Doe judge not to disclose information about a Doe investigation are prohibited from doing so. At minimum, witnesses, attorneys and others who participate in the secret court proceedings are prohibited from disclosing anything that was said in court, or anything, such as documents or other evidence, shown in the closed court proceeding. Judges have also issued broader secrecy prohibitions. For example, people who receive a subpoena to produce documents might be ordered not to disclose to anyone but their attorney the fact that they were subpoenaed, nor what information the subpoena seeks. 2. Secrecy doesn’t apply to "anyone" There is no blanket prohibition that applies to anyone who has some knowledge about a John Doe. For example, anyone who hears information second-hand about a Doe is not prohibited from talking about it. 3. A gray area Our experts disagreed on whether the John Doe law prohibits a person from commenting on any possible settlement negotiations. Some felt any secrecy order would not apply because settlement negotiations would be done in, for example, a lawyer’s office, apart from the secret proceedings in court. However, other experts said a secrecy order could apply to commenting on the existence of settlement negotiations because such negotiations could be the subject of discussion during the secret courtroom proceedings. Our rating Asked whether his lawyer was in negotiations to settle a John Doe criminal investigation, Walker said that under Wisconsin law, "anyone who knows anything about a John Doe can't talk about it." A person who knows something about a John Doe by virtue of participating in the secret court proceedings -- if they are individually ordered by a judge not to disclose anything about the proceedings -- is prohibited from revealing such information. But the governor’s statement is overbroad in suggesting that anyone who knows any information about a John Doe can’t talk about it. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Walker a Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-06-12T05:00:00	2014-06-01	['None']
pomt-08823	The United States accounted for 26 percent of worldwide military spending during the Cold War, but now accounts for 41 percent.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/13/barney-frank/barney-frank-says-us-share-global-defense-spending/	UPDATE: We first published this item on Aug. 4, 2010, and rated Frank's claim False. We heard from many readers who said we made the wrong call and urged us to take a second look. We did so, and have concluded that we put too much emphasis on percentage of GDP in reaching our original conclusion. We are now rating the claim Half True. Seeking to build a case that the United States should cut its defense budget, Rep. Barney Frank, D.-Mass., said the U.S. now accounts for a larger share of worldwide military spending than it did during the Cold War. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, on July 7, 2010, Frank said, "During the Cold War... [the United States accounted for] 26 percent of worldwide military spending. . . We're now 41 percent of worldwide military spending." His comments followed a Huffington Post article he co-authored with an unlikely political ally: Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. It said Congress should substantially cut defense spending to reduce the deficit. First we started by checking Frank's percentages. Although he was imprecise in his wording referring to spending during the Cold War, his office told us he was comparing 1986 with 2006, so the percentage Frank used for Cold War spending was a snapshot of a conflict that stretched from roughly 1947 to 1991. Frank’s choice of 1986 might seem arbitrary, but few countries recorded or gathered data on their military resources before the 1960s -- halfway through the conflict. And reports indicate reliable comparisons are only available for the 1980s -- the last decade of the Cold War. We reviewed records of U.S. defense spending, and spending in 1986 was at one of its highest points of the Cold War years, so if Frank is cherry picking, he's at least being fair by picking a year on the high end (picking a year of low spending might have presented an even wider disparity with regard to the growing share of worldwide defense spending shouldered by the United States). The source of Frank's figures was a report by the Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for the gradual demilitarization of international relations. And the report shows his 1986 number was off slightly, which his office acknowledged when we called. U.S. military expenditures were 28 percent of worldwide military spending in 1986, not 26 percent. His figure for 2006 was accurate. We spoke to the report's author, Carl Conetta, co-director of the Project on defense Alternatives, who said the data was primarily obtained from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's "World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers" reports, as well as from the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Conetta said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan obviously inflated the U.S.'s 2006 defense spending figures. If that war spending was backed out of the equation, he said, the U.S. accounted for about 37 percent of worldwide defense spending in 2006. But he added that in more recent years -- even with war spending taken out of the picture --the number is closer to the 41 percent cited by Frank. When we looked, we found that worldwide military spending dropped precipitously after the Cold War ended in 1991, falling by 40 percent between 1987 -- when it had peaked -- and 1995. Even though worldwide spending has risen consistently since 1995, adjusted for inflation, it’s still significantly below its Cold War highs. In other words, whatever percent of global expenditures the U.S. accounts for today, it’s a piece of a substantially smaller pie. While other countries were cutting their defense spending, the United States increased its spending some over the same period (in dollars adjusted for inflation). There's another way to measure defense spending that we feel is worth noting. A comparison can be drawn between a country’s military expenditures as a percent of gross domestic product, since that figure is not contingent on other countries’ expenditures. We looked at the years Frank cited using that measure. While federal outlays for national defense in the U.S. accounted for 6.2 percent of the GDP in 1986, according to a Historical Tables report by the Office of Budget Management, they accounted for only 4.0 percent of the GDP in 2006. During that period, the GDP in the United States rose by a whopping 45 percent, so military spending would have had to increase significantly to keep pace. Some may assume Frank's statistic means that U.S. spending on military has increased so dramatically that the U.S. share of military spending now comprises a significantly larger percentage of the world's military spending. But as the numbers show, that's not necessarily the case. Rather, other countries essentially cut their military spending while the United States slightly increased its spending. As a result, the United States now comprises a larger share of a smaller worldwide pie. There are lots of ways to evaluate defense spending. It's appropriate to look at spending as a percentage of GDP, said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But it's also perfectly appropriate to consider what the United States spends compared to the rest of the world. There are differences in those comparisons, but both are valid statistics to consider, he said. "It's a legitimate to ask, 'Why we are spending so much on defense if we are the world's only super power?'" Ellis said. Frank's statistic is not only accurate, said William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation, "I think it makes sense for the point (Frank) was trying to make. The others are going down and we're going up. We're at the highest levels since World War II." We were wary of Frank singling out 1986 to speak sweepingly for several decades of the Cold War. Conetta, the author of the report Frank based his comments on, said 1986 was used because it was near the peak of Cold War spending by the United States. U.S. spending as a percentage of worldwide defense spending would certainly change if you were to select different Cold War years, Conetta said, but probably only by a few percentage points (not counting years of armed conflict, like during the Korean War). And yet, there is clearly room for legitimate debate about which types of statistics one chooses to evaluate defense spending and how they should be presented. Frank cited a growing U.S. share of worldwide defense spending without also noting that U.S. defense spending -- as a percentage of GDP -- has actually decreased significantly since the Cold War, or that the growing disparity is largely driven by the fact that many other countries (primarily Russia) decreased their defense spending after the Cold War. Frank accurately (or very nearly so) cites those figures for 1986 and 2006, but they take on a different meaning in the broader context. So we rate Frank's comment Half True.

pomt-02354	"Reporters rehearse questions with White House press (secretary)."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/20/drudge-report/drudge-links-report-claiming-white-house-press-bri/	The Drudge Report, a conduit of conservative news, threw a wrench in the daily ritual of the White House press briefing. That’s when reporters pepper White House spokesman Jay Carney with questions. Drudge gave top billing to an item in the Weekly Standard, posted by online editor Daniel Halper. In Halper’s article, the headline said it all: "Reporter: WH press secretary gets questions from reporters before press briefing: It’s just a show." Halper didn’t write too much more. Mainly, he inserted a video of a reporter from an Arizona CBS affiliate talking about what she learned on her visit to the White House. The reporter, Catherine Anaya, said Carney told her that the questions correspondents ask "are provided to him in advance. So then he knows what he's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them." Drudge’s headline -- at the top of its page -- meant the news quickly spread through other websites and Twitter (likely making for a good traffic day at weeklystandard.com). Then came the rebuttal. Carney tweeted, "Briefings would be a lot easier if this were true! Rest assured, it is not." We got in touch with Anaya, and she let us know in an email that she had confused the matter. Basically, she had a question for President Barack Obama that was of more local than national interest. She had the option to submit it in advance, and she got that muddied with how the usual press briefings take place. "I was attempting to not waste national time on a local question but in my attempt at explaining that I unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone," Anaya said. "That is my mistake and I own up to it." Anaya’s station, CBS 5 News, also released a statement (from Anaya) saying she didn’t know the process for White House regulars. The statement was removed from the station’s website, but a copy is available here. The station says they are working on reissuing a statement. We’ll update this post when it’s available. Update: Here is the CBS 5 statement, issued by Anaya. "Last night during my live reports from the White House I attempted to describe the highlights of the day. I was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process I made two major mistakes: I reported an off the record conversation and what I reported was not accurate. I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting. But it was not intentional and I would never purposely report inaccurate information. The White House never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask. I chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because I wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal. I did not attribute or report factually last night and for that I deeply apologize. I pride myself on truth and objectivity. I sincerely regret any harm I've caused and I hope that you will We asked White House reporters if they are ever asked to send in their questions, and get replies, before the actual briefings. In one form or another, they all said, no way. (We also created a video attached to this fact-check that shows some of the interactions between Carney and the press corps.) Steve Thomma, senior White House correspondent for McClatchy and president of the White House Correspondents Association said, "I've never heard of a scripted set up before a briefing." CNN’s Jake Tapper, host of The Lead and veteran of many daily briefings, had a wry response: "The press briefing is not where you go to get clear and candid answers," Tapper said. "In terms of this bizarre meme that was birthed – no, I have never in any way submitted questions ahead of time to anyone at the White House for any reason." NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley was also bemused. "This story has generated some pained smiles today in the White House press room," Horsley said. Horsley explained that reporters ask plenty of questions outside of the briefings and so the press office staff will know what’s on their minds. If a longer term reporting story is in play, Horsley will tell the White House staff what he needs to know. "But as a general rule, the briefings are not scripted that way. If they were, they could be a lot shorter," Horsley said. We emailed the editors of the Weekly Standard but did not hear back. Halper, when confronted on Twitter by Fox News White House correspondent Ed Henry (who called the story "dead wrong"), said he was just reporting what Anaya said. Drudge eventually updated its website, linking to a different article from Daily Mail with the headline, "UPDATE: Reporter retracts story, says Press Sec doesn't get questions in advance..." Our ruling The Drudge Report gave top billing to the claim that the daily White House press briefings are "just a show," with questions submitted and answered in advance. That claim relied on the report of a television anchor in Arizona. But the Drudge Report did all it could to make the statement go viral. Accountability applies as much to spreading information, especially for a website as popular as the Drudge Report, as it does to the journalist who wrote the article. The reporter behind Halper’s article now says she made a mistake and really doesn’t know what happens in the briefings. She was considering asking a question about a local issue and wanted to know if it would be appropriate to ask at the regular press briefing. She opted to save the question for her interview with Obama. According to Carney and the reporters whom he faces daily, this scenario in no way matches up with their experiences. Halper took a shaky report and drew a strong conclusion without proof. Drudge put that claim on steroids. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

Michele Bachmann says President Barack Obama's approval ratings are historically low -- and sinking even lower. During the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Bachmann said, "President Obama has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern times. He hasn't gone to the basement yet. It'll be a lot lower than what it is now." We can't explore her prediction, but we can examine if Obama has the lowest ratings of any modern president. Are they really worse than those of Richard "Tricky Dick" Nixon, Jimmy "Malaise" Carter and Lyndon "Hey, Hey, LBJ, How Many Kids Did You Kill Today" Johnson? Not by a long shot. We looked at presidential approval data from Gallup, which goes back to Harry Truman. It’s the longest continuous data set for presidential approval ratings. We looked at two different measurements: Each president’s lowest approval rating for their entire term, and each president’s lowest point for their first 968 days, which is how long Obama has served in office. First, the lows for the presidents' entire terms, listed in descending order from the "highest" low to the "lowest" low: John F. Kennedy: 56 percent Dwight Eisenhower: 48 percent Barack Obama: 40 percent Bill Clinton: 37 percent Gerald Ford: 37 percent Ronald Reagan: 35 percent Lyndon B. Johnson: 35 percent George H.W. Bush: 29 percent Jimmy Carter: 28 percent George W. Bush: 25 percent Richard Nixon: 24 percent Harry Truman: 22 percent By this measure, nine presidents hit lower lows than Obama has. What about comparing only the first 968 days for each president? Bachmann’s closer with this one, but still wrong. Here is a list of each president’s low point during that time frame: John F. Kennedy: 61 percent Dwight Eisenhower: 57 percent George H.W. Bush: 53 percent George W. Bush: 50 percent Richard Nixon: 48 percent Lyndon B. Johnson: 46 percent Barack Obama: 40 percent Bill Clinton: 37 percent Gerald Ford: 37 percent Ronald Reagan: 35 percent Harry Truman: 33 percent Jimmy Carter: 28 percent By this measure, five presidents had lows that were worse than Obama at this point in their presidencies.

pomt-06407	Medicare monthly premiums will go up to $104.20 in 2012 and $247.00 in 2014 due to "provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election campaigns."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/27/chain-email/medicare-premiums-going-due-obamacare-chain-e-mail/	A chain e-mail going around warns of a Medicare premium increase, saying monthly premiums will go up from $96.40 to $247 in 2014. Blame it all on "Obamacare," the e-mail says. Here’s the full text of the copy we received: MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE For those of you who are on Medicare, read the article below. It's a short but important article that you probably haven't heard about in the mainstream news: The per person Medicare insurance premium will increase from the present monthly fee of $ 96.40, rising to: $104.20 in 2012; $120.20 in 2013; And $247.00 in 2014. These are provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election campaigns. Send this to all seniors that you know, so they will know who's throwing them under the bus. We decided to fact-check this chain e-mail, which we soon found has been floating around the Internet in one version or another since at least 2009. As we researched, we quickly realized two important points. First, the chain e-mail’s numbers are wrong. Second, explaining Medicare premiums is pretty complicated. So let’s start with a few Medicare basics: Medicare is the government-run health insurance program for Americans over age 65. Medicare’s Part A, which all beneficiaries receive, pays for hospitalization, while Part B pays for doctor’s visits and other regular health-care services. Based on the numbers it uses for premiums, it’s clear the chain e-mail is referring to what Medicare beneficiaries pay monthly for Medicare Part B premiums. Medicare calculates those premiums each year based on several factors that change from year to year. So the e-mail’s claim to know what Medicare premiums will be in the future doesn’t hold much water. In addition to that, the chain e-mail gets existing numbers wrong. Part B premiums were $96.40 back in 2009 (likely when the e-mail was first written). In 2011, the official monthly premium is $115.40. And as we were working on this report, the 2012 numbers were formally announced. The premium is $99.90 for 2012, not the $104.20 that the e-mail predicted. Also, "Obamacare" -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- didn’t make changes to the way that the official monthly rate for Medicare Part B premiums is calculated. There is some fine print here, though, and quite a bit of it. Most Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 still paid the 2009 amount, thanks to rules that say Medicare premiums cannot go up for existing beneficiaries if Social Security payments don’t go up. (This is known as the "hold harmless" provision.) Social Security payments did not go up in 2010 or 2011 because there was no cost-of-living increase due to a lack of inflation. On Oct. 19, the federal government announced there would be a cost-of-living, or COLA, increase in 2012. So even though the official Medicare rate dropped for 2012, most Medicare beneficiaries will see a small increase in rates, from the 2009 rate of $96.40 to the 2012 rate of $99.90. On the other end of the spectrum, some high-earning retirees pay more than the standard monthly premium. In 2011, beneficiaries who report income of more than $85,000 pay higher rates, all the way up to $369.10 for a person with income above $214,000 a year, or couples with income above $428,000. (See this chart for more details.) And the health care law does make changes to these rules affecting high earners -- it stops indexing the income limits for inflation through 2019, said Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. It means that "more people will hit the threshold that substantially reduces the subsidy received," Wilensky said, and it was not widely noted when the law passed. Here, we should explain a bit more about how basic Medicare premiums are calculated. It’s required by law that Medicare Part B beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their health care via premiums. Right now, the contributions are required to be about 25 percent of total costs. So every year, Medicare figures out what that 25 percent will probably be and then sets rates to meet that target. It’s surprising that the official rate is going down for 2012, given recent trends on escalating health care costs -- U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called it "pretty remarkable" in a conference call on Oct. 27, 2011, announcing the changes. Medicare administrator Donald Berwick said the low premiums were due to two changes. First, because of Social Security going up, more people will be eligible to pay the official rate, rather than remaining at an older rate due to the "hold harmless" provision. So increasing costs will be shared among a larger pool of beneficiaries. Second, he said that health care spending was growing more slowly than projected. (He credited that to increased emphasis on prevention and effective treatments.) Our ruling The chain e-mail claimed that Medicare Part B premiums would increase dramatically in future years because of the health care law supported by President Barack Obama. We couldn’t find evidence to support the e-mail’s numbers. And in fact, most Medicare beneficiaries will only pay $3.50 more a month in 2012. The e-mail’s projection for 2014 seems entirely fabricated. The health care law leaves in place the long-established methods for calculating Medicare Part B premiums. The chain e-mail makes the additional unproved claim that its allegations -- which are false anyway -- were accomplished nefariously and delayed for political purposes.

pomt-09347	"This census is also the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-2010-census-shortest-mo/	In a March 29, 2010, press release, Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees the census, attempted to rally Republican participation in the 2010 census after he said early early returns of census forms showed Republican counties were lagging behind, perhaps due to discouragement from "otherwise well-meaning conservatives." Back in June 2009, for example, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., complained that "the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." And on March 3, 2010, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone vote in the House against a resolution to encourage participation in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count. Explaining his vote, Paul said, it was "for the simple, obvious reason that the census, like so many government programs, has grown far beyond what the framers of our Constitution intended. The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information. It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups, rather than as individual Americans." McHenry worries that those kinds of comments might lead to lower Republican participation in the census, to the party's own detriment. A Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded "yes" or "don't know," as opposed 47 percent of Democrats. Seeking to allay some of those concerns, McHenry said, "This census is also the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history." "Conservatives need to know how important it is to fill out the census," stated McHenry stated. "It is one of the only things our Constitution specifically asks of U.S. citizens and boycotting will just help liberals expand government even further." In a separate item, we explored whether there is credible evidence Republican participation in filling out census forms is lagging behind that of Democrats. Here, we will tackle's McHenry's claim that the 2010 census is the shortest in modern history. The U.S. Census Bureau has long been touting the 2010 questionnaire as "one of the shortest census forms in history," with just 10 questions that take about 10 minutes to complete. And here they are: 1. The number of people living in the residence 2. Any additional people that might be living there as of April 1, 2010 3. Whether the residence is owned or rented 4. Telephone number (in case the Census Bureau has follow-up questions) 5. Name 6. Sex 7. Age and date of birth 8. Whether of Hispanic origin 9. Race 10. Whether that person sometimes lives somewhere else Still, note the "one of the shortest," qualifier in the Census Bureau's statement. That's because the short form for the 2000 census had just 8 questions. So it was shorter. But in 2000, one out of six households would get a long form, which had 53 questions. For the 2010 count, the Census Bureau did away with the long form altogether. Now, instead of asking the more detailed social, economic and housing characteristics questions in the long form once a decade, the Census Bureau now asks them in the annual American Community Survey, which goes out to about 3 million addresses each year, explained U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman Stacy Gimbel Vidal. In the decades prior to 2000, the short forms were all much longer than 10 questions. In 1990, for example, the survey posed seven population and seven housing questions. But samples of the population also got an additional 23 population questions and 19 housing questions. In 1980, the forms included 33 population questions and 7 housing questions (plus, a sampling got 23 more). We looked through an index of survey questions asked in each census through U.S. history and had to go back to 1840 before we found one shorter than 10 questions. But we don't think that counts as "modern history." For the record, in the very first census in 1790, assistant marshals listed the name of each head of household and then asked four questions. Now, "name" counts as one of the 10 questions, so the number of questions has essentially doubled (we also note that one of the questions now asks for your telephone number, to verify information, and back in 1790, the telephone was nearly 100 years away from being invented). We think McHenry can make a credible claim that this year's census is the shortest and least intrusive count in modern history. We'll dock him a bit because the short form of the 2000 census was technically shorter, with eight questions rather than 10. But in 2000, one in six got a long form census, which was much longer. And this year, everyone will get the 10-question form. We rate McHenry's claim Mostly True.	None	Patrick McHenry	None	None	None	2010-04-07T17:20:48	2010-03-29	['None']
pomt-10246	When oil and gas prices sent state revenues up, Palin sent "a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/29/sarah-palin/each-alaskan-got-1200/	John McCain chose Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska, as his running mate for the 2008 election. Palin joined the ticket at an event in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 29, 2008, delivering a speech discussing her biography and qualifications to be vice president. When she entered public office, she said her goals were "to stop wasteful spending, and cut property taxes, and put the people first." "When oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase, I sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska," Palin said of her accomplishments as governor. We looked into the record and found that Palin did push for a measure to return state surplus revenue back to residents of mineral-rich Alaska. On Aug. 7, 2008, the Alaska Legislature approved a measure she promoted that would send $1,200 to every Alaskan who qualifies. That comes to about $741-million for state residents, out of an estimated $2.7-billion in increased oil taxes and royalties. Purists might argue that the rebates only come to 35 percent of the estimated excess revenue. But still, it seems fair to us to describe a $741-million outlay as "large," and $1,200 per person is a nice windfall. We find Palin's statement True.

pomt-06000	The planned expansion of Savannah’s port is a "jobs creating project."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/20/nathan-deal/savannah-port-jobs-impact-unclear/	Boosters of the stalled plan to deepen Savannah’s port keep a laundry list of reasons why breaking ground is a good idea. You may have heard them before. The project, they say, will make the port more efficient, help the U.S. boost exports, and make Georgia more competitive in the global market. But few grabbed our attention like one by Gov. Nathan Deal about the port’s effect on jobs. The claim appeared in an op-ed in Roll Call, a Washington, D.C., publication with a Capitol Hill readership. Deal’s essay argued that Congress should give the dredging project money, even while the country is counting its pennies. "Updating vital infrastructure that supports jobs and increases U.S. competitiveness is not the place to find cost savings. In this new era of prioritization, this is exactly the type of export-boosting, jobs-creating project that should be at the top of our list," Deal wrote. Politicians often lace their pitches for expensive infrastructure projects with jobs claims, especially now that Georgia’s unemployment is stuck near 10 percent. We wondered if Deal had proof. A Deal spokeswoman suggested we call the Army Corps of Engineers for data and mentioned research by the University of Georgia on the economic impact of the state’s ports. We also looked for jobs forecasts for the port deepening. We found that there’s not much jobs data. Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Georgia Ports Authority and experts we interviewed said they were not aware of any economic impact study that analyzes how a deeper port would impact area jobs once it’s up and running. The Army Corps of Engineers did conduct an economic impact study, but it didn’t focus on jobs. It studied how the project would increase shipping efficiency across the nation, and the economic benefits this would create. The study does mention that if the port were dredged to the depth of 46 feet, construction could create as many as 5,000 "job-equivalents" during 48 to 60 months of construction. But take note. This number does not represent how many additional people would be hired to dredge the port. It includes jobs that would be created to make materials needed to dredge the port, or those that come about when workers spend their salaries. Furthermore, it’s not clear how many of these jobs would be new. The corps would contract with professional dredging companies that already maintain the harbor, said Billy Birdwell, a spokesman for the corps. It’s unclear how many additional people they would hire. Further complicating the matter is that each of these 5,000 job-equivalents amount to one job lasting one year. By this measure, a single full-time job lasting all five years of the project could count as five job-equivalents. Though there are not many specifics on the deepening project’s potential to create jobs, it’s clear that the Savannah port has a profound impact on employment in Georgia. Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, has conducted studies about the economic impact of the state’s port system. In 2009, workers held 14,131 full- and part-time slots at the Savannah port’s publicly owned facilities, according to a Selig Center study. If you add in the jobs to make the materials those workers used, as well as those to staff the places where those workers spent their pay, these jobs total 21,628, the study said. Because of major changes in the shipping industry, Georgia risks losing jobs if the port isn’t deepened, Humphreys said. An expansion project at the Panama Canal will allow a bigger class of megaships to sail into East Coast harbors. Businesses like using these ships because they can help reduce how much time and money they spend transporting goods. These ships require deeper ports, so major harbors along the Atlantic coastline are racing to update their infrastructure to win their business. If these ports are successful, the rewards could be big. A trade group representing businesses that move big cargo expects that shipments will jump dramatically along the East Coast once the Panama Canal expansion completes in 2014, according to an August 2010 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. If that happens, the Georgia Ports Authority expects to build cranes and rail yards to accommodate more containers, the Journal-Constitution reported in December 2010. Ports that don’t deepen may lose business, analysts told PolitiFact Georgia. "It’s really a matter of making sure the economic impacts that are already existing don’t go away," Humphreys said. How do we rule? Is the proposed Savannah port deepening a "jobs-creating project," as Deal said? The corps estimates that dredging the port will require additional workers, although it’s not clear how many. Evidence and common sense suggest that if megaships flock to a newly deepened Savannah port, the project could keep jobs in Georgia. It may well create them. But existing research offers little clarity. Since Deal’s claim leaves out the crucial fact that the jobs impacts are uncertain, we give him a Half True.

pomt-02662	"Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states ... the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years. Then, the money will go away."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-medicaid-expansion-money-will-go-/	The war on poverty would be more effective if states had more control over federal programs such as Head Start, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. In an interview with Rubio on CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer pointed out this approach resembles the optional Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Right-leaning leaders in several states rejected federal money to cover more residents through the federal-state program. "What if these states opt out of these programs?" Schieffer asked. Obamacare is different, Rubio replied. "Well, here’s the distinguishing factor. Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years," he said. "Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability. I’m not saying we should do that." Is Rubio correct about the federal money for expanding Medicaid going away after a few years? Somewhat. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand access to health insurance for the nation’s uninsured residents. The architects of the law envisioned an expansion of Medicaid in each state to cover low-income adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2013 was $15,856 for an individual or $26,951 for a family of three in 2013. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law as constitutional, but justices struck down the mandatory Medicaid expansion. That left it to state leaders to decide whether to offer more residents coverage through the jointly administered program. Twenty-three states are not expanding Medicaid, including Texas and Florida, states with high uninsured populations, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. On the other side, 26 states including the District of Columbia are implementing the expansion in 2014, and two states will move ahead with an expansion after the first year. For conservative governors in Ohio, Michigan and Arizona, the deal offered by the federal government to expand was too good to pass up. The federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of adding new adult Medicaid beneficiaries from 2014 to 2016. The federal government will scale down its payments to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The 90 percent level is permanent. States will not have to shoulder more than 10 percent of the cost after that, unless Congress passed a law to change the ratio. Our ruling Rubio said, "Under Obamacare, when you turn Medicaid over to the states, what you're saying to them is, the money will be available up front for the expansion for a few years. Then, the money will go away, but you get stuck with the unfunded liability." His office did not respond to us. The federal government will only pay 100 percent of the costs of expanding Medicaid for three years starting in 2014. But Rubio leaves a misleading impression with viewers that all of the money just goes away. The federal government plans to bring down its share to a permanent funding level of 90 percent. Rubio's statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13077	"Two years ago, the longest serving leader of the California republic, Jerry Brown, boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/nov/11/louis-marinelli/calexit-group-distorts-jerry-browns-separate-natio/	Following Donald Trump’s upset victory on Election Day, a group in deep blue California gained attention for its calls to create a sovereign Golden State. The Yes California independence campaign hopes to place a referendum on a future state ballot asking voters to decide whether to leave the United States. A Calexit, as the hypothetical separation has been called, would require two-thirds approval of both houses of Congress, and permission from 38 state legislatures. Leaders of the group have made some questionable statements as they pursue this seemingly implausible feat. They claim to draw inspiration from Gov. Jerry Brown, who they allege has already declared California "a separate nation." "Two years ago, the longest serving leader of the California republic, Jerry Brown, boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation," Louis Marinelli, president of Yes California, told a conference in Moscow on Sept. 26, 2016. Marinelli makes his claim at the :28 minute mark in the video above. The sovereignty group’s vice-president made a similar claim in a 2015 interview. We wondered what evidence, if any, the group had about Brown declaring California "a separate nation." We set out on a fact-check. Our research Brown visited China on a trade mission in 2013 with the goal of spurring Chinese investment in California. We found no evidence he told the Chinese that California was a "separate nation" on that trip. Reached by email, Marinelli pointed us to a March 2015 Desert Sun news article in which the governor was quoted as saying California is, indeed, "a separate nation." The article says Brown made that comment, however, at an event in San Francisco marking the release of a report on California’s collaboration with China to combat climate change, not on his trip to China. Here are Brown’s comments from the article: "It is a little bold to talk about the China-California partnership as though we were a separate nation, but we are a separate nation. We're a state of mind. I include Silicon Valley, I include the environmental activism, the biotech industry, agriculture. This is a place of great investment in innovation." A video from the event shows Brown added a bit more context than was captured in the article. Immediately after saying "we are a separate nation ..." the governor says "... in our own minds. Or maybe I should put it this way: We're a state of mind." A California independence group has seized on comments made by Gov. Jerry Brown's at the 11:30 minute mark in this video. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that the "Context of (Brown’s) statement is clear: California’s footprint—it’s geography, economy and innovation—gives it as much influence / impact as a nation and that’s the point." The governor released a statement this week reacting to Trump’s election, calling for national unity. "With the deep divisions in our country, it is incumbent on all of us – especially the new leadership in Washington – to take steps that heal those divisions, not deepen them. In California, we will do our part to find common ground whenever possible." Hypothetical comparisons From the governor’s follow-up comment "We’re a state of mind," in the 2015 news article, it seems clear Brown was speaking symbolically about California being a distinct country. For years, the Brown Administration has made hypothetical economic comparisons between California and major nations across the globe. In June, for example, it released GDP figures showing California would be the sixth largest economy on the planet, if it were a nation. With nearly 40 million people, California has a larger population than many countries. Brown has positioned California as an international leader on climate change, working with major countries on the topic at venues such as the Paris climate change conference last year. In doing so, however, he’s never called for California to break away from the U.S. Our ruling Louis Marinelli, president of the sovereignty group Yes California, recently claimed that Gov. Jerry Brown "boldly declared in China that California is a separate nation." There’s no evidence Brown ever declared California’s independence, in China or anywhere else. Instead, Marinelli greatly distorted comments the governor made not in China, but at a San Francisco climate change event. Brown did say California is "a separate nation," but it was hardly a bold declaration. He immediately followed it up saying California "is a state of mind," indicating he was speaking symbolically. Brown has elevated California to an international stage in his climate change fight, and has talked about the state being the sixth largest economy in the world, if it were a nation. Marinelli ignored all context and greatly misconstrued Brown’s comments. We rate his claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-08433	The new health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/18/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-health-care-law-hammers-small-busi/	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is attacking Betsy Markey, a Colorado House member running for re-election, for supporting major Democratic initiatives. But in making its criticism, the chamber distorts key parts of the proposals. "Colorado is facing economic disaster," the ad says. "We told Betsy Markey we needed jobs. Why didn't she listen? Markey fought for the Obama-Pelosi government take over of health care, crushing small businesses with billions in penalties. Now Markey wants a national energy tax, costing families nearly $2,000 a year. Call Betsy Markey, tell her to listen. Tell her to stop supporting Pelosi and making the economy worse." Markey did vote for the new health care law, a major overhaul of health care regulations, as well as a cap-and-trade law intended to curb carbon emissions and address climate change. But the ad's descriptions of those measures are deceptive. For example, Markey does not favor a national energy tax. She did support a cap-and-trade proposal that limits carbon emissions of polluters by requiring them to buy permits. Companies would more than likely pass on their costs to consumers, but it wouldn't cost nearly $2,000. Nonpartisan agencies estimate it would cost families between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. We wrote a detailed analysis last year when Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said that the Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create "a $1,761 yearly energy tax." We rated the statement False. The $1,761 number was a figure created and promoted by a conservative blogger. Here, we're looking at the ad's claim that the Democratic health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties." We found this claim perplexing, because small businesses can actually qualify for tax credits under the new health care law. Generally speaking, tax credits are available to employers with fewer than 25 employees who are paid average annual wages of less than $50,000. If the employer pays for at least half of the insurance for workers, the employer gets a tax credit for part of the contributions. Those tax credits start for the 2010 tax year, and they increase in 2014 when more provisions of the health care law take effect. During the debate leading up to the health care law, members of Congress considered -- but ultimately rejected -- a straightfoward mandate requiring employers to offer health care to workers and imposing penalties if they didn't. Instead, they came up with a complicated fine for large employers. Starting in 2014, large employers who don't offer health care face a fine, but only if their workers qualify for tax credits from the government to buy health care. It's likely that most large employers who don't offer insurance will have to pay the fine. But again, small employers -- those with 50 employees or fewer -- are exempt from the fine. Still, that's the provision the Chamber pointed to when we asked them for evidence for the claim in the ad. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the fines would come to $52 billion over 10 years. We should note that there's a lot of political mischief to be had around the term "small business." Pollsters tell us that Americans have very positive opinions of small businesses, but people often have different ideas of what size a small business is. In a similar vein, Republicans have made the case this year that most of the wealthiest Americans are actually small business owners, but that's a dubious claim. We looked into a statement to that effect earlier this year and rated it Barely True. And the health care law does impose some new taxes on the wealthiest Americans: It imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the investment income of couples who make more than $250,000 or individuals who make more than $200,000. The Chamber argued that businesses can have more than 50 employees and still be considered small businesses. Spokesman J.P Fielder pointed to regulations from the Small Business Administration that consider a small business to be anyone with 500 or fewer employees. And it's true that generally speaking, the Small Business Administration does consider a small business to be a firm with 500 employees or less. But there are exceptions for that, depending on the industry. For example, a manufacturing firm with 500 employees is probably a small manufacturer, but an accounting firm with 500 employees is relatively large, said spokesman Hayley Matz. In some cases, the small business designation is determined by the firm's revenues, not the number of employees. We also looked at research the Small Business Administration compiles using data from the U.S. Census. Their research shows that the vast majority of businesses in the United States have fewer than 50 employees. In 2007, 5,814,584 firms had fewer than 50 employees, compared with a total just over 6,049,655 firms. In other words, 96 percent of U.S. small businesses are specifically exempted from fines on employers who don't insure their employees. The Chamber's ad said that the new health care law crushes small businesses "with billions in penalties." But some small businesses will actually get tax credits from the health care law. Meanwhile, almost all small businesses -- those with fewer than 50 employees -- are exempt from penalties, whether they offer insurance or not. Some small businesses are larger than 50 employees and could face fines if they don't offer employees insurance. But a vast majority of U.S. firms are smaller than 50 employees and are exempt from the health insurance requirements. The chamber's ad is sweeping, and doesn't account for any of the positive provisions that don't "crush" small business but actually help them. So we rate the Chamber's statement False.

pomt-04700	Says Mitt Romney told university students in Ohio that to start a business, they should "borrow money if you have to from your parents."	true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-mitt-romney-advised-college-stu/	Making a case for President Barack Obama, Julián Castro said the Republican presidential nominee lacks a common touch. "Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn’t get it," the San Antonio mayor said in his Sept. 4, 2012, keynote at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. "A few months ago, he visited a university in Ohio and gave the students there a little entrepreneurial advice. ‘Start a business,’ he said. "But how? ‘Borrow money if you have to from your parents.’ "Gee, why didn't I think of that?" Castro said to delegates’ delight. Castro continued: "Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents, but that shouldn't determine whether you can pursue your dreams. I don't think Gov. Romney meant any harm. I think he's a good guy. He just has no idea how good he's had it." Did Castro accurately recap Romney’s student advice? According to news accounts, Romney visited Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio (northeast of Columbus) on April 27, 2012. And, as reported at the time by The Washington Post and other news organizations, the candidate told an auditorium full of students and faculty that Obama’s policies had amounted to an attack on success and on those who aspire to be successful. "This kind of divisiveness, this attack on success," Romney was reported as saying, "is very different than what we’ve seen in our country’s history. We’ve always encouraged young people, take — take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money, if you have to, from your parents. Start a business." We checked his quoted comments against a video taken of his 35-minute speech by Marc Kovac, an Ohio reporter for Dix Newspapers. It shows his exhortation occurred toward the end of a presentation otherwise lacing Romney's criticism of Obama’s stewardship of the economy with vows to spur the economy and unite the country. But was Romney recommending borrowing money from parents to start a business or to pay for an education or both? His wording and delivery didn’t make it clear. In fact, the National Journal’s report on the speech said that Romney reported that Romney "offered a group of college students this advice: If you want to get an education or start a business, borrow money from your parents." An aide to Romney clarified later that Romney said he was referring to business loans when he suggested students borrow money from their parents," and not, the wording indicates, borrowing to go to college. The National Journal amended its story. In any event, Romney followed his remark at Otterbein U. by citing the example of sandwich chain Jimmy John’s, which owner Jimmy John Liautaud launched by borrowing $20,000 from his father (in return for 48 percent of the business) to start the shop, the Post and New York Daily News reported. The Post account says: "Liautaud’s father had made the loan on the condition that if his son wasn’t able to return the money, with interest, within a year, he would have to join the Army." Romney told the audience that Liautaud’s "sandwiches are doing pretty well. He’s got shops all over the country and thousands of people who work with him. This is kind of an American experience." Asked about Castro’s claim, Romney campaign spokesman Christopher Walker said by email that cherry-picking one statement from one speech, "a national policy does not make." Romney, Walker said, has laid out his desires to create more jobs and increase take-home pay. Separately, we searched the Nexis database of news coverage and did not unearth other instances of Romney lofting the borrow-from-your-parents' idea.

pomt-11852	"Coal production up 7.8% in past year. Down 31.5% last 10 years. #endingwaroncoal."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/donald-trump/trump-pairs-recent-rise-coal-output-ending-war-coa/	President Donald Trump has vowed to end what he calls a "war on coal." Recently, Trump tweeted some good news for the industry. "Coal production up 7.8% in past year," Trump wrote in his Oct. 31 tweet. "Down 31.5% last 10 years. #endingwaroncoal." Attached to the tweet was a Fox News report that had precisely that figure. The stats played across the screen, and the reporter wrapped up with "the war on coal is over, and good news for coal." Fox News told us they drew on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Short-term Energy Outlook report for October. There are actually a couple of numbers there. The one Fox News used was a forecast for 2017. It predicted that coal production would go from 728 million short tons in 2016 up to 785 million in 2017. That amounts to a 7.8 percent rise. Fox News could have gone with a higher number based on actual rather than predicted output. The government report said that in the first nine months of the year, production was 12 percent higher than at the same point the year before. So if anything, Fox News understated the increase. As for the drop over the past 10 years, that might be an understatement, too. The government numbers show a decline closer to 33 percent. There are a few other things to know. Perhaps most important, the government doesn’t expect the increase to continue. The same energy outlook said "coal production is expected to increase by 8 percent in 2017 and by less than 1 percent in 2018." That’s in line with a couple of independent assessments. A 2017 report from the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at West Virginia University, focused only on West Virginia coal, anticipated growth in 2017 followed by modest increases until 2020. But "after 2020, statewide coal production is expected to fall," the report said. The forecast is the same at the national level. A Columbia University analysis also anticipated a rise, but its best-case scenario showed a "modest recovery" that in the middle of the next decade would level off at 2013 levels. The rise also needs to be seen in historic context. One reason 2017 looked good is that 2016 was particularly bad, as this chart from West Virginia University makes clear: Coal had been been falling for years, as a result of several factors. The market for coal mainly depends on the price of natural gas, foreign demand and, to a lesser extent, the impact of government policy on domestic demand. At the top of the list, coal competes with natural gas as a fuel to produce electricity. Natural gas prices tumbled with a flood of natural gas largely due to technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Utility companies went for the cheaper option. Brian Lego, co-author of the West Virginia University study, said that coal producers in the southern part of West Virginia faced another challenge, a collapse in demand in China for the sort of coal used in making steel. "There was over capacity in global steel production," Lego said. "When the Chinese pulled back on producing that steel, there was less need for metallurgical coal." On top of that, as economic growth cooled off a bit in China, so did the country’s need for power. It cancelled 85 coal-fired plants that had been in the works. India had a similar story, which further reduced the demand for coal. The turnaround in 2017 came from a slight rise in the price of natural gas, which made coal more competitive on the domestic front. An uptick in demand for coal from China’s steelmakers raised prices for metallurgical coal, which allowed smaller mines that had been idled to come back online, Lego said. Clean air regulations put coal at a disadvantage compared to natural gas, he said, as electric utilities increasingly opted for natural gas as a cleaner fuel. "Those rules were fully implemented in 2015," Lego said. "That’s when you saw the old coal-fired plants retired." Lego said he’s seen no impact so far from the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce regulatory pressures on coal. The one change championed by the White House that holds the most promise, he said, would require utilities to keep larger stocks of fuel on hand. Administration policies could have a larger impact down the line. The Columbia University research group estimated that if fully implemented, the White House policies could increase production by 37 percent over what might have been under Obama administration policies. Our ruling Trump said that coal production rose 7.8 percent since 2016. The number tracks back to a government forecast, which is less certain than actual production figures. But based on data for the first nine months of 2017, the increase was even higher -- 12 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Trump tied the increase to the theme of "ending the war on coal." The research we found said shifts in the price of natural gas and foreign demand are the primary drivers, not government regulation.

pomt-11280	"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/24/newstarget/no-government-has-not-approved-human-consumption-h/	An old story has reappeared on social media claiming that the U.S. government has approved the sale of horse meat from slaughterhouses for food. "USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption," read the headline on Newstarget, a website providing information for "educational and entertainment purposes." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Here’s the real story: In 2006, Congress effectively banned horsemeat by forbidding the U.S. Department of Agriculture to spend money on inspecting slaughterhouses. Meat plants can’t operate without USDA inspection. The last three slaughterhouses in the United States (two in Texas and one in Illinois) closed in 2007, one year after the ban. The ban was part of the annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011. In 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law. The bill didn’t allocate any new money for inspections, but activists worried that it might eventually lead to sales of horse meat. The Newstarget story’s origin is likely from an actual 2012 incident when a New Mexico meat plant received federal approval to slaughter horses for meat, which was met with opposition from many animal rights groups. The USDA stated that it was required by law to issue a "grant of inspection" to Valley Meat Co. of New Mexico, because it had met all federal requirements. While Valley Meat Co. planned to process horse meat for human consumption in Europe and other export markets, as well as sell it for animal feed at U.S. zoos, there is no evidence that they sold the meat for consumption in the United States. More recently, a bipartisan ban on slaughtering horses for meat has been included in a spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in March of this year. The renewed ban on will continue at least until Oct. 1 when the funding bill expires. Our ruling An article said that the USDA approved slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption. That still hasn’t happened. We rate this Mostly False.	None	Newstarget	None	None	None	2018-04-24T17:22:36	2016-02-23	['United_States_Department_of_Agriculture']
pomt-10582	Romney left Massachusetts "with a $245-million debt because of the big government-mandated health care system."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/31/john-mccain/more-costly-than-expected-but-no-debt/	At a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican debate, John McCain repeated a statistic he has often cited on the campaign trail, attacking the health care reform initiated in Massachusetts when Mitt Romney was governor. McCain said that Massachusetts now has "a $245-million debt because of the big government-mandated health care system" that Romney helped establish. Romney responded: "You know, a lot of people talk about health care. I'm the only one that got the job done. "I got health insurance for all our citizens. We had 460,000 people without insurance. We got ... 300,000 of them signed up for insurance now. I'm proud of what we accomplished. "The bill that I submitted to the legislature didn't cost $1 more than what we were already spending. However, the legislature and now the new Democratic governor have added some bells and whistles, and they're willing to pay for them. "I wouldn't do that if I were governor. I would veto the items they put in place there, but they're entitled to make changes if they want to. "They're still running a balanced budget. I wouldn't have added the money they did. And by the way, no debt was left. I left a rainy day fund of over $2-billion. "Facts are stubborn things. I'm proud of my record." Well, let's get to those stubborn facts. When Romney was governor of Massachusetts in 2006, the state initiated an ambitious health care reform package aimed at drastically reducing the number of people without health insurance. At the time, the state estimated there were about 400,000 uninsured residents (though the U.S. Census put the figure closer to 600,000). At issue is the Commonwealth Care program in which taxpayers subsidize free or low-cost health services to low- or moderate-income residents who are uninsured. Let's be clear that Romney did not leave the state in debt. McCain seems to be speaking of a projection on rising costs of the program in the current fiscal year. To that point, the state anticipated there would be 135,000 people participating in the Commonwealth Care program in fiscal year 2008 ending June 30. As of the first of the year, there were 169,000 people participating (and they anticipate it will rise to 172,000 by the end of this fiscal year). Bottom line, the program is going to cost more than expected. While the cost is higher than expected, the numbers are actually a source of pride for many involved with the program. Dick Powers, a spokesman for the authority that oversees Commonwealth Care attributed the higher than expected participation to an "extremely aggressive and successful public education and outreach effort to enroll people." The state budgeted $472-million for the Commonwealth Care program, but because of higher participation rates, it is now projected to cost $618-million this year. That comes to $146-million more than anticipated. So where does McCain come up with $245-million? McCain's campaign did not respond to several requests for backup information, but in one speech where he made the same quote, McCain cited a Boston Globe article. The article noted that the state is expected to exceed the initial budget for the health insurance initiative by about $245-million this year. In addition to costs from higher than anticipated participation, that number includes negotiated increases in supplemental payments to hospitals that offer free health care to uninsured people ($113-million more than was budgeted). In addition, after Romney left office, the legislature changed its formula so that as of July 2007, people making 150 percent of the poverty level would be eligible for free health services through Commonwealth Care (the threshold used to be people making under 100 percent of poverty level). That's some of the "bells and whistles" Romney was referring to. It raised costs about $13-million, Powers said. As for the claim that Romney saddled the state with $245-million in debt from the health care program, the fact is the program is fully funded, said Cyndi Roy, deputy press secretary for Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a Democrat. Patrick will submit a supplemental budget later this year to reflect the increased costs, Roy said. "It is certainly more than anticipated," Roy said. "But it'll be covered. It's not in the red." And here's another thing. The same report that projects the $245 million in over-budget spending for the Commonwealth Care program also has some numbers McCain didn't note: free health care provided to the uninsured — which cost $600-million in 2007 — is expected to drop 12.5 percent this year, 25 percent by 2009. McCain said Romney's program left Massachusetts with $245-million in debt. That's misleading. It did not leave the state in debt. Yes, the program is costing more than expected. Some might call it a victim of its own success. And in noting how much more the program is expected to cost, McCain fails to note how much the program is projected to save. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13082	Says "thousands" at a Manhattan rally for Donald Trump were chanting "We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/09/social-media/no-evidence-support-rumors-we-hate-muslims-chant-t/	A viral tweet allegedly sent from the ground of an election night rally for President-elect Donald Trump said that "thousands" of his supporters were chanting a racist message. The claim was fake. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As Buzzfeed and others have reported, the tweet was sent from the account of a fake British sports journalist who has a history of making allegations about racist chants in mass crowds. Another "Simon Rowntree" account was suspended over the summer, but Buzzfeed managed to screenshot his Twitter bio, which said he was a soccer writer for Forest Echo News. The site‘s account has also been suspended but it declared itself to be a parody in its bio, per Buzzfeed’s screenshot. The parody news site was the creation of a group of friends who set up fake sports journalist accounts, a person who responded on behalf of Forest Echo News told Buzzfeed. Rowntree is likely a Forest Echo fan jumping on the bandwagon. Here are some examples of Rowntree tweets alleging chants of racial epithets at British soccer games from his current account. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Racist chants are not uncommon at British soccer matches, so Rowntree’s tweets are believable though unverified and likely satirical (see Poe’s law for internet parodies). As for Rowntree’s allegation about the Trump rally, we have not found video footage or other evidence supporting it. Trump held his victory party at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan, which can accommodate 3,300 in its grand ballroom. Rowntree claimed the chant began at 7:04 p.m., about 30 minutes after the event had began. According to videos, the crowds were rather subdued around that time. News reports indicate Trump supporters inside and outside the Hilton did not get rowdy until about 10 p.m., when projections began favoring Trump as the winner. A few dozen — not "thousands" — supporters roaming Midtown shouted "T-R-U-M-P, we will beat Hill-ar-y," "U-S-A" and "CNN sucks" at about 10:25 p.m., according to Patch New York. And Trump supporters inside the Hilton began to chant "lock her up" around 2 a.m., CBS’ Sopan Deb and NBC’s Katy Tur both reported. Our ruling A viral tweet said, "thousands" of people at a Manhattan rally for Trump chanted, "We hate Muslims, we hate blacks, we want our great country back." The widely shared claim is baseless, sent from a fake account tied to a parody British soccer news site. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-05638	Says Romney flip-flopped on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/22/american-bridge-21st-century/pac-ad-sketches-romney-abortion-flip-flopper/	Fresh off a resounding primary win in Illinois, the Romney campaign used the momentum to make the case that the Republican primary contest was all but wrapped up and the former Massachusetts governor would inevitably be the nominee. Then the Etch A Sketch remark happened. On March 21, 2012, Mitt Romney’s senior communications director, Eric Fehrnstrom, gave an interview on CNN about the strategy for the general election. Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney’s opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven’t endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters. "It's fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now," said political comedian John Fugelsang. "Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?" Fehrnstrom answered, "Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again." As expected, Romney’s opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children’s toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney’s firmness on issues. Here we’ll check one such ad, put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion. First, the toy In case you skipped childhood, we’ll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch. First manufactured in the 1950s, the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they’re turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece. The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you’re done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas. Now, the ad The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom’s comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words "Romney on the issues" above it. Music that sounds like it’s coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background. The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: "I support a woman’s right to choose." Then the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears. "I believe strongly in protecting life." The ad goes on to portray Romney’s apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan.) For this fact-check, we’ll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate. We found a Boston Globe story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender. Following a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts’ state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him "to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt's camp at the convention," according to the Globe. Romney responded: "The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he's pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman's right to choose doesn't follow very well." That’s the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge’s ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he’s made, however, express the same sentiment. For one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." And, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." For another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." The second Romney quote in American Bridge’s ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. "I believe strongly in protecting life," the ad says. We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge’s spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes "were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present." It’s well-documented that Romney’s past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views: "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services." "I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life," he said in a debate that same month. In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, "I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed." Finally, we have examined Romney’s shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.) Our ruling American Bridge’s ad suggests that Romney has been both an abortion rights supporter and an opponent. Using statements on an Etch A Sketch screen, the ad first portrays Romney as supporting abortion rights, then as opposing them. In other words, a flip flop. The quotes in the ad accurately portray Romney’s past and present stances, but the punctuation suggests they are his actual words. The second statement was not a literal quote, and that’s worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney's position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster. It’s accurate and doesn’t leave out anything important. We rate it True.	None	American Bridge 21st Century	None	None	None	2012-03-22T18:16:40	2012-03-21	['None']
pomt-04655	"We've doubled our use of renewable energy."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-weve-doubled-our-use-renewable-e/	During an appearance in Seminole, Fla., on Sept. 8, 2012, President Barack Obama touted the nation’s achievements in expanding the use of renewable energy. "I’ve got a plan to control more of our own energy," Obama said. "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, your cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. That will save you money. It will help the environment. We’ve doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans now have jobs building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries." The line about renewable energy was identical to a line in Obama’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. We wondered whether Obama was correct that we’ve "doubled our use of renewable energy." We began by asking the Obama campaign to back up the claim. A spokeswoman cited three statistics from the Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that collects energy data. • Net electricity generation from wind, which more than doubled between 2008 and 2011. • Net electricity generation from solar has more than doubled over the same period. • During the first five months of 2012, the United States has produced more electricity from wind than it did in all of 2008. We checked the data and found out that all of these comparisons are accurate. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The problem for Obama is not that the trend is inaccurate, but that he used the wrong words to describe it. Solar and wind are not the only types of renewables The agency's tables include several additional categories of renewable energy, including hydroelectric, geothermal and various types of biomass energy. If you put them all together by BTUs, wind energy in 2011 accounted for 11 percent of all renewable-energy production. That’s not 11 percent of all energy production, including coal, oil and natural gas -- that’s 11 percent of just the production from renewable sources. Solar, meanwhile, was even smaller. It accounted for about 1 percent of all renewable energy production. If you look at all types of electricity generation from renewables, the increase isn’t double between 2008 and 2011 -- it’s 55 percent. "Energy" and "electricity" are not the same thing Not all renewable energy is used to create electricity. For instance, some renewable energy is used for transportation, primarily ethanol in gasoline. This ethanol is counted in the "energy" category but not in the "electricity" category. Much smaller amounts of biomass are used for heating in colder locales or in industrial facilities like paper mills. So, to use Obama’s words, did renewable energy -- not just electricity -- double between 2008 and 2011? No. The increase in megawatt hours was about 25 percent, according to EIA data and estimates. "Taken literally, the quoted statement is imprecise and probably misleading," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, an energy-policy think tank. Our ruling In his two speeches, Obama said, "We've doubled our use of renewable energy." But while the nation has made strides in expanding electricity generated by wind and solar -- the most high-profile part of the administration’s policies -- the increase for all kinds of energy, and for all types of renewables, was about 25 percent. That’s far short of doubling, so we rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-11T10:53:43	2012-09-08	['None']
pomt-02619	"Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/23/florida-all/florida-spent-over-100000-noncitizen-voter-purge-2/	At the start of a statewide election year, Democrats and the NAACP launched new attacks on the state’s plan for a new round of searching for noncitizens who registered to vote. House Democratic leader Mark Pafford of West Palm Beach and the NAACP held a press conference Jan. 13 to criticize Florida’s Republican administration for preparing to send a new batch of names of potential noncitizens to county election supervisors. Secretary of State Ken Detzner, an appointee of Gov. Rick Scott, is leading the project. In a press release, the left-leaning group Florida for All criticized the state’s spending on the effort in 2012: "Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012, producing lists with hundreds and hundreds of citizens that local Supervisors of Elections proved were legally registered voters. Over 80 percent of those on the purge lists were people of color and more than 6 in 10 were Hispanic. It was a costly embarrassment that Floridians fear will be repeated." Florida for All is a political action committee that is at least in part funded by the Democratic Governors Association. The group’s main target appears to be Scott, who faces a re-election this year and could face his predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Crist who is now a Democrat. At PolitiFact Florida we have fact-checked multiple claims about the state’s 2012 effort to search for noncitizens who registered to vote. But we had never researched the total dollar figure attached to that effort: Did Florida spend "over $100,000" for that initiative? Origin of $100,000 claim related to SAVE data In 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. The state later reduced that list to 2,600 -- and then again to about 200. As county election supervisors found multiple errors, later criticizing the effort as "sloppy" and "embarrassing," the project was scrapped as presidential election day approached. In the end, about 85 registered voters were removed from the list. Detzner later apologized and vowed a better process this time using a federal data source called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government programs and licensing, such as welfare, driver’s licenses, unemployment compensation and other benefits. We asked Neal Waltmire, a spokesman for Florida for All, to explain how it concluded that the state spent "over $100,000" in 2012. Waltmire directed us to a May 2012 story by NPR Miami correspondent Greg Allen. The story included this sentence: "Chris Cate, a spokesman for Ken Detzner, the secretary of state, says his office is working to improve the process — spending about $100,000 to update its records." The story did not explain what that cost included. Cate, who is now a spokesman for Florida’s CFO Jeff Atwater, told PolitiFact he didn’t recall placing a total dollar amount on the project. "It’s regular staff time -- there wouldn’t be a way to quantify the value," Cate said. "It is people who would be working anyway." It costs the state 50 cents each time it checks a name in SAVE. So at the time of the NPR story, it was possible that the state would process 180,000 names -- so at 50 cents a hit that would equal $90,000, or close to that $100,000 figure. But ultimately the state scrapped the effort and never checked all those names using SAVE data. What the state actually spent So how much did the state end up spending on the 2012 project? We can’t put a total dollar value on that because it would be difficult to account for the time spent by state elections’ staff. However we were able to nail down some costs by interviewing Detzner’s spokeswoman Brittany Lesser: • The total litigation costs for Florida’s case against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in it’s quest to gain access to SAVE was $50,705 in August 2012. The state used outside counsel. • The Secretary of State must pay DHS $300 a year to access SAVE. "There were no other upfront costs," Lesser said. * In 2012, the state spent about $1,287.50 checking names using SAVE data. (It’s unclear how many names were checked, in part because some names checked more than once.) County election supervisors also had expenses though we didn’t attempt to quantify the amount. "County expenses would basically be staff time which would not be broken out usually and any postage and notice publication costs for individuals notified," said Ronald Labasky, attorney for the statewide association of election supervisors. "Since there weren’t very many before it stopped, it probably wasn’t very much." Our ruling Florida for All said in a press release, "Rick Scott’s Administration spent over $100,000 of taxpayer money during their first voter purge attempt in 2012." The number comes from a May 2012 news story. The amount based on 50 cent charge per search for using SAVE and multiplied times 180,000 names on a list of potential noncitizens. But months later the state abandoned its effort long before it got to checking all of those names. We can’t fully account for the state’s costs; for example, we can’t account for the time that government employees worked on the project. But we do know the state spent a total of about $52,000, largely for litigation and to use SAVE data. The group wrongly used a source that was based on initial information about the state’s project and did not reflect the total cost months later, resulting in a total that was about double the best number we could nail down. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Florida for All	None	None	None	2014-01-23T10:00:00	2014-01-20	['None']
pomt-08716	Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett "has held the line on property taxes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/barack-obama/obama-says-tom-barrett-has-held-line-property-taxe/	President Barack Obama, in Milwaukee on Aug. 16 to attend a fund-raising luncheon for Tom Barrett’s gubernatorial campaign, praised the Milwaukee mayor for intervening in a domestic dispute outside of State Fair Park last year - and cast his fellow Democrat as something of a hero to taxpayers, saying in his remarks: "Under his watch, this city has held the line on property taxes, it’s expanded opportunity, it’s put more cops on the street and reduced crime as a result." The part about property taxes caught our attention. Barrett isn’t widely regarded as a tax hawk -- at least not in comparison with Scott Walker and Mark Neumann, the Republican candidates for governor. "Held the line," of course, may mean one thing in the eye of the holder and another in the eye of the beholder, so let’s take a look. We’ll start with a definition. To hold the line, according to Merriam-Webster’s definition, is to "maintain the current position or situation." So, if you don’t increase property taxes at all, that certainly fits. Or if an increase is within inflation -- and does not come with any hidden costs -- that may fill the bill as well. When we asked the White House to elaborate on Obama’s "held the line" comment, a spokesman referred us to the Democratic National Committee. The DNC e-mailed PolitiFact Wisconsin a statement that made four points. One point spoke of why Barrett raised the levy -- the total amount of property taxes collected -- and another told how he has worked to cut pension costs. Neither of these points addresses how much property taxes have risen under Barrett. The DNC’s other two assertions were more on point - but not very persuasive: First, in Barrett’s six years in office, the DNC said, property taxes have risen less than inflation in three of those years. Even that part of the DNC statement was confusing and included an error. It used "taxes" and "tax rates" interchangeably, when DNC spokesman Derrick Plummer later told PolitiFact Wisconsin it should have said "tax levy." Additionally, Plummer said the increase was below inflation in two years and near inflation in a third. So, the levy increase was higher than inflation in four of six years. Second, Barrett’s proposed levies, the DNC said, were higher than the levies ultimately adopted by the Common Council in four of the six years -- but less than 1 percent higher. That sounds like the council, not the mayor, was more closely watching the bottom line. Moreover, highlighting the difference between the executive and legislative branches says nothing about how high taxes actually went up. Beyond that, revenue collected from fees has more than doubled under Barrett. That means property owners are paying higher fees -- for services that used to be covered by property taxes -- as well as higher property taxes. The newest fee -- for storm water management -- was created under Barrett; he proposed it and the Common Council approved it in 2006. When you add revenue from the storm water fee to revenue from the three other major fees -- for solid waste disposal, snow and ice removal, and sewer -- the fee collection total is projected to hit $89.6 million in 2010 -- more than double the $40.1 million that was collected when Barrett took office in 2004. Shifting the cost of a city service from the property tax to a fee does spread that cost among more payers; for example, nonprofit organizations that don’t pay property taxes do pay fees. But, the bottom line is that the city is now collecting nearly $50 million per year more in fees under Barrett for services that used to be provided through the property tax levy. So, let’s re-focus strictly on property taxes. We’ll use 2004 as the base line. That was the year Barrett was elected mayor and the year that the tax levy was approved for his first budget, in 2005. Starting with the levy for 2004 of $199,012,386, the levy increased 2 percent for 2005; 4.96 percent for 2006; 3.3 percent for 2007; 3.25 percent for 2008; 4.29 percent for 2009; and 4.12 percent for 2010, when the levy is to hit $246,754,533. The six annual increases total 21.92 percent, which means levy increases under Barrett have averaged 3.65 percent per year. The figure led Dale Knapp, research director of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization in Madison, to disagree with Obama’s characterization of Barrett’s record on property taxes. "I’m not sure if I would call that holding the line on taxes," Knapp said. "They’re (the levies) not growing outlandishly, but then again, they’re not flat or growing at a couple percent either. They seem to be generally very average." Surprisingly, perhaps, Michael Birkley, an advocate for lower property taxes, agreed with Obama’s take on Barrett. Birkley is legislative director of Madison-based Wisconsin Property Taxpayers, a group not as well known as the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. WPT says it works "to reduce the statewide property tax burden and reform Wisconsin’s antiquated and regressive property tax system." "Held the line? You bet he did," Birkley said of Barrett. In his estimation, that means not holding growth below inflation, but using a combination of inflation and an allowance for new construction growth in the city. That was the formula set out under Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature in the years the state put a cap on property tax growth. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI-U -- the consumer price index for urban consumers. Its figures for the Milwaukee-Racine area show an average increase of 2.48 percent per year from 2004 to through the first half of 2010. Meanwhile, figures from the City of Milwaukee assessor’s office show growth from new construction averaged 1.91 percent per year from 2004 through 2010. Together, the two figures tally an average growth of 4.39 percent. That’s more than the 3.65 percent average increase in the property taxes collected. In his assessment, Birkley said he is not including the shift to fees: "Our concern is the property tax," he said. That’s fine. But to the average resident, it’s money from a different pocket. Had the revenue from fees remained on the levy, property taxes would have risen an average of 5.87 percent per year during Barrett’s six years, well above the 4.39 percent increase in inflation plus new growth. So, how does all of this shake out? Property taxes may not have not shot up under Barrett; the increases in levies have been kept below inflation plus new growth in the city. But in some years the city was limited by state-imposed caps on how much property taxes could be increased. And, in some years, the property tax levy was lower than the mayor proposed once the Common Council finished its work. President Obama’s statement ignores the shift of items from the property tax to fees, with total revenue collected from the four main fees more than doubling under Barrett. So city property owners are hit with that increase, on top of the higher property taxes. We rate the president’s remark Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11718	Missouri "is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health. Innovation is happening right here."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/15/roy-blunt/sen-roy-blunt-mostly-right-about-health-care-progr/	Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt has been on a mission to expand access to mental health and behavioral health patients. He believes it should be treated the same way as physical health. Blunt spoke recently in Springfield about the importance of the Excellence in Mental Health Act, which he first introduced in 2014. "After visiting community health centers and certified community behavioral health clinics across Missouri, I’m proud to see firsthand how our state is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health. Innovation is happening right here," Blunt said Oct. 13. Access is improving, but has Missouri become the leader in championing this cause? Steps taken We reached out to Blunt’s office, which referred us to a press release from Missouri Coalition for Community Behavioral Healthcare. Download PDF Missouri was one of the eight states initially selected to participate in the pilot program of the Excellence in Mental Health Act. This is a demonstration program that would implement a Medicaid prospective payment system for community behavioral health services. Being one of the few selected for this pilot program already puts Missouri ahead in the nationwide effort to improve mental and behavioral health services. Debra Walker, director of the Office of Public and Legislative Affairs for the Missouri Department of Mental Health, agrees with Blunt. She believes Missouri has become a national leader in the expansion of mental and behavioral health services, pointing to many of the new initiatives taking place in the state. Others shared this view. "Sen. Blunt has truly been an asset in representing the state of Missouri in areas relating to mental health services and has historically been a strong advocate for our most vulnerable population," said Denise Mills, vice president of corporate relations for Burrell Behavioral Health. Brent McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition, agrees, stating that Missouri is paving the way in "whole-person" health. "Our health care home program is leading the nation in results around cost reduction and physical health improvement among the 25,000 Missourians we serve," McGinty said. As a representative of all of the Missouri Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, McGinty said Missouri is currently working with law enforcement and developing a statewide system to better address behavioral health crises. "It’s hard to really say which state, if any, is leading the country for providing services for mental and behavioral health," said Ronald Honberg, senior policy advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Honberg points out that there is no system in place for measuring this. "It’s fair to say that Missouri has been innovative," said Honberg, pointing to Senator Blunt and Joe Parks as champions in the cause in improving coordination between mental and behavioral health. Parks is the Medicaid director for the Missouri Department of Social Services and a member of the National Council for Behavioral Health. Some of the innovative work Missouri has been doing is with Emergency Departments and Mental Health First Aid, which are considered cutting edge across the country. Future of mental and behavioral health Currently there are no statistics to show where Missouri stands in improving services for mental and behavioral health as part of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, but measures are to be reported to the federal government according to McGinty, president of the Missouri Coalition. "Under the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic demonstration, sponsored by Senator Blunt, we will finally start reporting to the federal government real behavioral health measures," McGinty said. Recently, Sens. Blunt and Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, along with Reps. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, and Doris Matsui, D-California, announced this would be expanded to 11 more states. With the inclusion of more states it will more likely create distinctions in who is and is not leading the nation in regard to improving services for mental and behavioral health. As of now, Missouri is implementing new measures to address whole-person care. Some of these initiatives include a partnership for Hope Waiver for Developmental Disabilities and the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, high security facility at Fulton State Hospital. "The state that actually is moving ahead fastest, gets the most done, where access and quality are both being addressed, the state that not only comes to my mind but everyone in the field’s mind, is Missouri," said Linda Rosenberg, CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health in a 2016 press release. Our ruling Blunt said Missouri "is leading the country when it comes to improving services for mental and behavioral health." Under the demonstration program sponsored by Blunt, Missouri will start reporting real behavioral health measures to the federal government. The reports will include information regarding time between request for treatment and treatment, hospital follow-up and medication adherence. Experts agree that Missouri has started several new initiatives to improve and innovate when it comes to services for mental and behavioral health. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14738	Says President Barack Obama’s homeland security budget had "$16 million to fight climate change" but "didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/18/sean-duffy/barack-obama-gives-homeland-security-millions-clim/	A remark by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy about President Barack Obama, climate change and violent extremism was so startling that an interviewer made a point to repeat it. And it made us wonder: Does the Department of Homeland Security really spend a bunch of money on climate change but doesn’t make it a priority to fight "violent extremism?" The Wisconsin Republican made his claim Dec. 9, 2015 after being asked about the terrorism in San Bernardino and how to fight such domestic threats. "When the president sent over his budget to the House of Representatives, he had a homeland security budget," Duffy said on "Varney & Co.," a talk show on Fox Business Network. "He put $16 million to fight climate change in Homeland Security, and didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism. The president doesn’t take this seriously." The claim surprised host Stuart Varney. "That’s very important, Sean," Varney replied. Obama's budget for the Department of Homeland Security had $16 million for climate change "but nothing extra, that we know about, to fight and find these guys who are already here? That's the situation?" Varney asked. "That is the situation," Duffy said. Well, not really. There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremists -- defined by the department as "individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals." A line item can signify whether something is a priority, as Duffy argues. But his claim is misleading in that DHS, as well as other federal departments, spend money to fight violent extremism. Climate change To back the claim, Duffy’s office cited PolitiFact National’s May 2015 fact check of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. McCaul had said more money is dedicated within the Department of Homeland Security to climate change than what's spent combating "Islamist terrorists radicalizing over the Internet in the United States of America." Our colleagues rated the statement Mostly True. But Duffy’s claim is much broader -- about fighting violent extremism generally, rather than spending specifically to fight Islamist terrorists over the Internet. Our colleagues found that the Department of Homeland Security’s budget for fiscal 2016 arguably included $16 million for climate change. That figure was part of Duffy’s claim. There is $10 million "for analyses of climate change impacts on infrastructure critical to national and economic security, and national public health and safety." And $6 million for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of homeland security, for "climate workshops and regional resilience coordination" done by FEMA. And while the Department of Homeland Security has a senior-level official who serves as the coordinator of Countering Violent Extremism, that office has no separate line item in the budget. But just because there isn’t a line in a budget doesn’t mean the department is ignoring violent extremism. A few examples from the Department of Homeland Security’s budget: Four to eight full-time staff assigned to countering violent extremism. $1 million for a database to analyze past violent extremist incidents and see what sort of programs work best to head off attacks. Part of the department’s $1 billion National Preparedness Grant Program to state and local governments can be spent on projects to spot early signs of terrorist planning. Said Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile: Four to eight staffers isn’t a sign of a high priority to "when you consider that DHS employs more than 240,000 people." Fair point. But does the average citizen necessarily care which department’s federal employees are involved in fighting violent extremism? The Department of Homeland Security works with federal and local agencies on countering violent extremism. And the Justice Department has a $15 million line item for countering violent extremism, including $4 million for "domestic radicalization research." Our rating Duffy said Obama’s homeland security budget had "$16 million to fight climate change" but "didn't have a line item to fight violent extremism." There is no line item in the Department of Homeland Security budget for fighting violent extremism. But that ignores the fact that millions of dollars are allocated, inside and outside the Department of Homeland Security, to counter violent extremists. Duffy’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-14343	"To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-cuba-safe-harbor-fugitives-and-terr/	As President Barack Obama works to restore relations with Cuba, opponents of the policy shift cite Cuban practices that they see as contradictory to U.S. interests. "To this day, this is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives," said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., in a March 17 news conference. We were curious about Ryan’s claim, particularly because last year the Obama administration removed Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Cuba first made the list in 1982, when the country was actively supporting communist revolutions in the thick of the Cold War. There are some U.S. fugitives and a handful of terrorists living in Cuba, but experts told us these are more remnants of the Cold War rather than a staple of modern Cuban policy. Ryan’s statement is "accurate but outdated," said Ted Piccone, senior fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Project on International Order and Strategy and Latin America Initiative. Fugitives We weren’t able to pin down a more recent number, but the State Department said in a 2008 report that more than 70 U.S. fugitives lived in Cuba, some receiving protection and resources from the Cuban government. The list includes individuals accused of murder, hijacking and even insurance fraud. Piccone said it’s fair to say these fugitives are under "safe harbor" in Cuba. Joanne Chesimard might be the most high-profile U.S. fugitive living in Cuba. Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army, was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. She escaped prison and fled to Cuba in 1984. There’s also William "Guillermo" Morales, a member of Puerto Rican militant group Armed Forces of National Liberation, who was convicted on weapons charges in New York in 1979. A State Department report published in 2015 said Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States on this front in recent years, and the two countries have engaged in talks about returning some of these fugitives. While Cuba has been returning wanted criminals to the United States on a case-by-case basis, the Cuban government generally has declined to return fugitives they perceive as political, according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Cuban government also believes the United States harbors Cuban fugitives, like Luis Posada Carriles, a Cuban exile convicted of bombing a Cuban airliner in 1976, who now lives in Miami. And if fugitive exchange talks are to move forward between the two countries, Cuba will want its fugitives to be on the table, Piccone said. Terrorists Who are the "terrorists" who live in Cuba? About two dozen members of Spanish separatist group Basque Fatherland and Liberty, designated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist group, live in Cuba with permission from the Cuban government. There’s no evidence to show that Cuba has allowed these individuals to conduct terrorist activity while in Cuba, according to the State Department. In his statement, Ryan was referring to this group, a spokesperson said. Cuba has significantly ratcheted back its support for U.S.-designated terrorist groups since the early 1990s, said Frank Mora, a professor at Florida International University and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere under Obama. During the Cold War, when Cuba sided with the Soviet Union, Cuba supported what it perceived as liberation movements around the world. But the United States viewed many of those communist groups as terrorist organizations, like the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. When the Cold War ended in 1991, however, Cuba recalculated, Mora said. Cuba pulled out of these movements in order to focus on internal economic problems and, in part, to not give the United States any reason to amp up its anti-Cuba policies. "In recent years, Cuba has taken a number of steps to fully distance itself from international terrorism and has taken steps to strengthen its counterterrorism laws," the State Department found. For example, Cuba has enacted policies to criminalize terrorist financing. And Cuba has shared counterterrorism intelligence with the Obama administration and condemned various recent terrorist attacks, according to the CRS report. "Cuba has not been identified for several years for supporting international terrorism," Piccone said. While Ryan’s statement is technically correct — as there are U.S. fugitives and some members of a U.S.-designated terrorist group living on Cuban soil — his phrasing doesn’t capture the positive change in this arena that has happened in Cuba over the past quarter century, Mora said. "He’s implicitly suggesting there’s a flow of fugitives and terrorists coming to Cuba, and that’s not true," Mora said. Our ruling Ryan said, "To this day, (the Cuban government) is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and fugitives." There are some U.S. fugitives and members of a Spanish separatist group living in Cuba with the Cuban government’s permission. But Ryan’s statement misses an important nuance: In the past couple decades, Cuba has been more cooperative with the United States in terms of returning fugitives, and the country has cut ties with foreign organizations designated by the United States as terrorist groups. Significantly, the United States recently removed Cuba’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Ryan’s statement is accurate but could use that additional clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-03-24T10:52:26	2016-03-17	['Cuba']
pomt-03497	Says "At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment" under Affordable Care Act.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/08/chain-email/will-seniors-be-denied-cancer-treatment-under-obam/	According to a chain email making the rounds, people over 75 years old will be denied cancer treatment under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, after President Barack Obama. The email also states that vitamin B12 shots won’t be covered under Medicare because of Obamacare. Also, your primary care physician will have to admit you into a hospital -- as opposed to, oh let’s say, an emergency care doctor -- or Medicare won’t pay for it, again, because of Obamacare. Here’s a portion of the chain email, which a reader in Northeast Portland forwarded to PolitiFact Oregon, with a plea for more information. She said it came from a friend: "Your hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under Obama Care. You must be admitted by your primary Physician in order for Medicare to pay for it! If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered. This is only the tip of the iceberg for Obama Care. Just wait to see what happens in 2013 & 2014! … (ellipses) Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on. We all need to be informed. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS... At age 76 when you most need it, you are not eligible for cancer treatment page 272." The email goes on with a long list of other claims as assessed by a Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. PolitiFact Oregon hopped to it. And we learned very quickly -- through the power of the Internet -- that a version of this chain email has been kicking around since 2009, based on H.R. 3200, a 2009 bill that did not become law. Many of the claims have been debunked. In fact, FactCheck.org found just four of the 48 claims in the original email to be accurate. PolitiFact ruled two statements to be Pants on Fire. The chain email has morphed over the years, with new assertions added. As for the cancer-related statement, the email cites page 272 of H.R. 3200 to back up its assertion that seniors at 76 are not eligible for cancer treatment. Later, the email specifies that under Section 1145 of H.R. 3200, "cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." Neither statement is accurate. There is no rationing, based on age or otherwise, on cancer treatment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010. Likewise, there is no rationing or cut-off age in 2009’s H.R. 3200. H.R. 3200 contained a section on "treatment of certain cancer hospitals." But the American Nurses Association described the section as "the opposite of rationing. The section allows Medicare to pay cancer hospitals more if they are incurring higher costs." FactCheck.org agrees with the nurses group. And again, the bill never became law. "All medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age," said Katherine Fitzpatrick with the Medicare Rights Center in Washington, D.C. and in New York. Yet, none of the debunking seems to matter, because four years later, the email lives on via the forward button. The Internet is unstoppable. What, we wondered, did the Texas judge think of his undying notoriety? "I wish it would die. I can’t control it," David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon. "I don’t know how something like that goes viral like that." The former judge said he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, the letter was republished online. Kithil wants readers to disregard his letter as it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. "I’ve had calls from all over the country, 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this," he said. He pleads with the callers, "Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it." He says he still has problems with the Affordable Care Act, but that’s neither here nor there. Both the Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the national organization for seniors, verified that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare, the government health plan for seniors 65 and older. The Affordable Care Act reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with readmissions within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not based on who admits the patient. Also, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid says Medicare has never covered vitamin B12 shots as a preventive benefit. Again, this isn’t related to the Affordable Care Act. Older patients diagnosed with cancer need not worry that treatment will be rationed or denied under the Affordable Care Act. The claim is based on an inaccurate reading of a bill that went nowhere. We don’t know where or how the specific age of 76 was added -- Kithil said he doesn’t remember including a specific age in his letter. But we do know enough to rule this widely debunked and ridiculous-on-its-face statement a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-06-08T06:00:00	2013-06-03	['None']
pomt-09708	Page 92 of the House health care bill "says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/03/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-page-92-prohibits-private-/	House Democratic leaders last week released the health care bill they plan to bring to the floor, and it didn't take long for the Republicans to publish a laundry list of complaints about it. We'll be exploring those complaints with a story we'll publish later today or tomorrow, but in the meantime, we'd like to explore one of the points made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican from Minnesota. She made the statement on Oct. 30, 2009, on Sean Hannity's show on the Fox News Channel. She said that on Page 92 of the new bill, "it says specifically that people can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain, which means people will ultimately go into a single-payer plan where it is government providing health care and only one single government system. That's why this is so bad, Sean. This is socialized medicine ... This is, as I said, the crown jewel of socialism. It's what Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid have wanted from the very beginning." (See her comments starting about the 2:15 mark in this video .) We won't rate her opinion that Democrats are proposing the "crown jewel" of socialized medicine, or her prediction that it will ultimately lead to a single-payer system. Instead, we're interested in Bachmann's claim that Page 92 of the bill prevents people from buying private health insurance after a certain date. We not only find that she is misinterpreting that one page, but that she's also distorting the other 1,989 pages of a bill that would construct a system largely based on private health insurance. Her claim is a serious misrepresentation of a plan that relies on a marketplace of private coverage. Bachmann's office did not respond to our call or an e-mail, but we found the language that she seemed to be referring to on Page 91 of the new bill: "The individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1." To decipher it, we called Karen Pollitz, project director for the Health Policy Institute at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. She said it was a clause that allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep an old policy they like. "If you have a plan that's in effect prior to the effective date (of the exchange) and you like it, you can keep it," she said. (This is similar to a claim we checked back in July when the editorial page of Investor's Business Daily said the bill would outlaw private insurance . We rated that Pants on Fire.) Here's how the exchange would work: Under the House bill, insurance companies would sell individual policies through a government-run health care exchange, and the government would set minimum standards for coverage. For example, the government would require companies to cover people even if they have pre-existing conditions such as serious illnesses or pregnancy. The government would also set levels for minimum coverage for services such as mental health coverage. But if someone liked a plan they owned before the new law kicks in, they'd be able to keep the policy, no matter the level of coverage. The rules would largely prevent insurance companies from changing benefits in these grandfathered plans or altering the premiums. So Bachmann is referring to language that prevents the health insurance companies from enrolling new people in old plans that don't meet the new standards, Pollitz said. Any plan sold after the new law is enacted must provide better coverage. Bachmann is incorrect that people "can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain." To the contrary, a key principle of the bill is to create a new marketplace for people to buy private insurance. People who already get private coverage from their employer would continue to do so and should be able to shop for new plans with different coverage. People who are self-employed or work for small businesses will be able to buy private insurance through the new exchange. In fact, the bill requires that everyone have some form of coverage, Pollitz said. "Not only do you have to [buy insurance], but you can" buy it after the bill goes into effect, she said. "There's no reasonable way to look at Page (91) and say that you couldn't." Bachmann isn't just guilty of misinterpreting the language from one page of the bill. She's taken that misinterpretation to a ridiculous extreme — the claim that no private insurance could be sold after a certain date. That ignores the central tenet of a plan that's been discussed for months — that the plan would rely on a marketplace of private insurance. So we rate her claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09538	"The governor’s not taking his own fiscal advice. ... In the first fiscal quarter of this year, we’ve seen a 13.5 percent increase in spending, double-digit spending out of the executive branch in the State of Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/08/debra-medina/Me/	For the next governor of Texas, one task will overshadow all the others on the to-do list: closing a state budget shortfall that some projections put as high as $15 billion. During the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, candidates were asked to detail what programs they would cut or taxes they would raise to balance the budget. Debra Medina, who is in the three-way race for the GOP nomination with Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, took the opportunity to criticize the incumbent’s fiscal record. "You know, it’s unfortunate that the governor’s not taking his own fiscal advice," Medina said. "The 'Fiscal Notes' just released by the (state) comptroller last week shows in the executive department in the first fiscal quarter of this year, we’ve seen a 13.5 percent increase in spending, double-digit spending out of the executive branch in the state of Texas, when everyone here has been tightening their belts for a year." Has Perry become a heavy-spending governor? We wondered whether Medina's statement was on the money. The "Fiscal Notes" that Medina cited is a newsletter produced by the state comptroller’s office. For the first quarter of fiscal 2010 — that’s September through November 2009 — it reported that expenditures went up 13.5 percent for the "executive" segment of general government compared with spending by that segment in the same quarter the previous year. But what falls under the "executive" category? We put that question to the state comptroller’s office, which answered with a list of 25 agencies categorized as executive and administrative. That's not to say that the governor is directly responsible for all of those. In Texas, executive powers are spread among elected officials, including the governor, the attorney general and the comptroller. At least five agencies on the list are the responsibility of either the attorney general’s office or the comptroller’s office. Most of the other so-called executive agencies are commissions, offices or departments led by administrators appointed by the governor or whose governing boards include gubernatorial appointees. The governor's office is directly responsible for only three line items on the comptroller's list, including the Office of State-Federal Relations. Now, let’s look at the money. The 13.5 percent jump in spending that Medina referenced reflects a $196.5 million net increase for all the agencies. (The "net" part is important because some of the agencies saw their expeditures decline in the first quarter.) By far the largest spending jump ($87.3 million) occurred in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, whose board is made up of gubernatorial appointees. However, almost all those dollars came from the federal government, not the state. They were spent on recovery costs related to Hurricane Rita, which hit in 2005; on utility payments for low-income people; and on a homelessness prevention program and other initiatives that were part of the federal stimulus package approved by Congress last year. The attorney general’s office is No. 2 on the published spending list. Most of its $36 million increase — about $32 million — was attributable to higher collections of child-support payments. The comptroller’s office also accounts for a significant chunk of the spending increase, about $36.8 million. All told, these free-standing agencies — Housing and Community Affairs, the attorney general’s office and the comptroller’s office — account for about 80 percent of the net increase in first-quarter expenditures cited by Medina. So where does spending controlled by the governor fit in? Of the three entities on the list that are directly tied to his office, two spent less during the first quarter compared to the year before. The third line item, "Governor -- Fiscal," showed a $15 million net increase in the quarter. According to Perry’s office, a small portion, about $800,000, was federal stimulus money. The biggest expenditure of state funds, $10 million, consisted of disaster relief related to hurricane damage. The rest went to the governor’s economic development initiatives, the Emerging Technology Fund and the Texas Enterprise Fund, as well as incentives to attract film projects. Summing up: The governor's office was directly responsible for about $14 million in increased state spending, or 7 percent of the $196 million spending increase that caught Medina's attention. One caution: Virtually every agency official and government watcher we spoke with warned against drawing conclusions about spending or budget trends by solely looking at one quarter of activity, partly because spending can fluctuate based on when various grants and loans are passed through. Finally: Medina is correct that overall spending by agencies in the executive portion of state government went up 13.5 percent in the first quarter. But placing the responsibility at Perry’s feet isn't justified. The largest chunk of the spent money came from the federal government, and the bulk of the remaining "executive branch" expenditures took place in agencies run by other elected officials. We rate Medina's statement as Half True.	None	Debra Medina	None	None	None	2010-02-08T12:25:22	2010-01-29	['Texas']
pomt-11385	Says Rebecca Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she "took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/28/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-attack-supreme-court-candidate-rebec/	In what is nominally a nonpartisan state Supreme Court campaign, the Wisconsin Republican Party is supporting Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives. With the April 3, 2018, election drawing near, the party attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is supported by liberals. On billboards in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Eau Claire that were announced March 12, 2018, the GOP claimed: "Hypocrite Rebecca Dallet took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her." Dallet has taken campaign contributions from lawyers who have cases before her -- which is not uncommon and is not prohibited by the state Judicial Commission. But the thrust of the GOP’s claim -- that Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she took the contributions -- misfires. The money The billboards refer to more than 100 cases, with roughly three-quarters of them that were pending when Dallet received campaign donations from lawyers on those cases. Other cases cited either had not yet been filed or had been closed. The largest donation was $2,500 from attorney Howard Sicula in June 2017. He had a wrongful death case pending in Dallet’s court at the time. Now to the thrust of the GOP’s claim. Dallet a ‘hypocrite’? The billboard refers viewers to an anti-Dallet state GOP website. It cites comments Dallet made at a Jan. 22, 2018 Federalist Society Supreme Court debate. Dallet began by saying: "So, I do recuse myself when there is any appearance that it’s not going to be fair." The GOP contends that statement means Dallet is a hypocrite because she took campaign contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. But the rest of Dallet’s statement makes it clear she didn’t pledge not to take campaign contributions from lawyers, but rather that she would recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. She also drew a contrast with the first campaign of state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who decided not to seek reelection. Here’s the rest of Dallet’s statement during the debate: My husband works for Husch Blackwell, a larger firm, and I made the decision to remove myself from any case that they handle. That is not required by our ethics rules … but I decided that the better course of action, so that it is fair to everyone involved, is to just recuse myself from all those cases …. This is not about contributions from attorneys to our campaigns; that is allowed by our ethics rules. And certainly if it was an extreme amount, that would be something that the judge would have to look at. What we’re talking about with our recusal rules, that is the issue that I’ve been talking about, is the fact that when a party is in front of the case (judge) and that party has spent money -- significant amount of money, massive amounts of money, like the $2.25 million spent on Justice Gableman’s campaign -- how can anyone look at that and think that that’s fair? Dallet also referred to recusing herself from cases involving her husband’s firm in January 2018 at a candidates event and in an interview. Although it does not bear on the rating of this fact check, it’s worth noting that the Wisconsin State Journal reported in early March 2018 that Dallet presided over at least one case involving attorneys from her husband’s law firm; and that Dallet recused herself from three recent cases on her docket involving attorneys from the firm after being asked about them by the newspaper. Our rating The state Republican Party says Dallet is a "hypocrite" because she "took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her." Dallet has received campaign donations from lawyers who had cases in her court -- something that is common in judicial campaigns and allowed by state judicial ethics rules. But on the hypocrite part of the GOP’s statement, Dallet did not pledge that she would not accept contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. Rather, her pledge was to recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-03506	"Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/06/republican-governors-association/barbara-buonos-record-tax-debt-hikes-targeted-gop-/	In much the same way that a woodpecker keeps at its target, Republicans continue hammering Democrat Barbara Buono on her political record when it comes to taxes and debt. The latest salvo in the increasingly testy gubernatorial campaign comes from the Republican Governors Association, which last week released a TV ad about Buono’s record on those issues. The group backs Chris Christie, who was the RGA’s vice chairman last year. "Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times," a narrator states during the ad. "Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards." Similar to other gubernatorial campaign ads from both Christie and Buono, claims in this ad ignore context and misplace blame. Let’s start with the claim of 154 votes in favor of tax increases and then look at the others. We have previously rated this claim True. Between 1996 and 2010, Buono voted in favor of various measures that raised either taxes or fees on things ranging from tanning and limousine rides to higher gross income tax rates on New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes, or she supported tax policy changes resulting in higher costs for individuals and businesses. And the ad is correct that those increases affected utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins and more, according to a list of votes provided by Republicans to PolitiFact New Jersey for the years that Buono has served in the Legislature. We confirmed every vote on the list, but Buono obviously wasn’t the only legislator to support the increases. Next up, property taxes climbing 70 percent under Buono. Property taxes did increase 70 percent in New Jersey in the 10 years before Chris Christie became governor, when the state was overseen by Democratic administrations. Buono was a member of the Legislature during those years but that doesn't make her responsible for the hikes. Property taxes are voted on at the local level. As for a sales tax increase, Buono voted to raise the tax, but also supported earmarking part of the resulting revenue for property tax relief, according to a statement from her campaign. Now let’s look at whether she drove New Jersey into $2 billion worth of debt. The RGA claims Buono was the "architect" of Corzine’s budget when she chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee in 2008 and 2009, working on the fiscal year 2010 budget. But the governor – not the committee chair – has the final say on the budget. Still, by the time Christie came into office on Jan. 19, 2010, the state had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, has told us that a variety of factors – including the recession -- led to that deficit. The recession, for example, was a main reason why the state fell short on anticipated revenues. "I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall," Caprio told us in a previous fact-check about this deficit. As for the entirety of the ad, Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said in a statement, "Governor Christie and his national Republican sponsors’ false attacks on Senator Buono’s record are attempts to distract from the truth: they have made careers off defending millionaires over working and middle class families. Senator Buono has consistently fought to make millionaires pay their fair share to provide property tax relief to New Jersey’s middle class." The RGA did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling An ad from the RGA claims, "Barbara Buono by the numbers: As a Trenton politician, she voted to raise taxes 154 times. Under her, property taxes up 70 percent. Backed a 16 percent sales tax increase. Utilities, nursing homes, cell phones, parking lots, lottery wins, gyms – She taxed them all. Architect of Corzine’s budget, she drove New Jersey $2 billion into debt. Barbara Buono by the numbers: taking New Jersey backwards." Each claim on its face has a degree of accuracy, but lacks context and places blame squarely on Buono. As we have noted before, she has some responsibility for these increases because she voted for them, but they wouldn’t have happened without approval from either Corzine or a majority vote in the Legislature. We rate the ad Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Buono did not vote for a 70 percent hike in property taxes during the decade before Chris Christie became governor.

pomt-12556	El Paso is the "safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/apr/14/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-relies-disputed-rankings-calling-el-p/	Democrat Beto O’Rourke closed out March 2017 by declaring his longshot 2018 bid to deny Republican Ted Cruz re-election to the U.S. Senate--also repeatedly reviving a flawed claim about his hometown's relative safety. Confirming his candidacy before constituents, the congressman called El Paso "the safest city in Texas, the safest city in the United States." The same day in Dallas, O’Rourke told a crowd: "El Paso, Texas--safest city, safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States. And listen, lest you think that it’s due to walls or drones or aerostat blimps or militarization of the border--we’ve been either the safest or one of the top three safest cities in America since 1997. We are a safe city." O’Rourke made a similar claim in Austin the next day. Hold on, pardner. We’ve identified factual flaws in such proclamations. In 2011, we found Mostly False a claim that El Paso had been named the nation’s safest large city. El Paso had topped a 2010 "Lowest Crime Rate" list for cities of 500,000 residents or more. But only a city press release named El Paso the nation’s "safest" large city--and El Paso’s police department subsequently dropped the label. In 2013, we rated Half True a claim that "El Paso is the safest city of our size in the nation." As in 2011, the statement was tied to calculations by CQ Press linked to crime data published by the FBI that the agency strongly counsels against using to compare communities. In 2011, the FBI said it "strongly discourages" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to evaluate locales or the effectiveness of police departments. That note also said: "Despite repeated warnings against these practices, some data users continue to challenge and misunderstand this position. Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale." O’Rourke concedes rankings not perfect When we inquired, a volunteer O’Rourke aide, John Meza, told us O’Rourke relied on the CQ Press lists and related news stories to conclude that El Paso stands out as the nation’s perpetually safest city. Meza offered as O’Rourke’s backup a CQ Press document, "City Crime Rankings 2014," which states that based on its analysis of 2012 FBI-collected statistics, El Paso had the "lowest crime-rate ranking" among cities of 500,000 residents or more (with Austin No. 3 and San Antonio No. 10): SOURCE: Document, "City Crime Rankings 2014," CQ Press, undated (web link received by email from John Meza, volunteer, Beto O’Rourke U.S. Senate campaign, April 3, 2017) By phone, O’Rourke later conceded the CQ Press lists aren’t a "perfect way to assess a city’s relative safety." "There’s got to be a better way to do this," O’Rourke said. "Until there is, I’ve only got what the FBI reports" as interpreted by CQ Press. "If you’ve got a better source, I’m all yours," O’Rourke said. CQ Press sticks with disclaimer CQ Press has warned against using its rankings to talk up any community's relative safety. In our 2013 fact check of the claim about El Paso being named the country’s safest city, CQ Press’s summary didn’t identify the border city as the nation’s safest big city--on purpose, we were told. A CQ Press spokeswoman, Marina Ilishaev, then told us that until 2009, it had used "safest" and "dangerous" to describe cities having the lowest and highest rankings by its analysis. "Even though the rankings are still provided," she said by email, "these terms are no longer used because perceptions of safety and danger are just that—perceptions. The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization." "...We would add, as we do in our methodology section, that we mean by ‘lowest composite reported crime rate’ the largest deviation below the national median in six main crime categories, which are counted equally," she said. Specifically, CQ Press says its crime-rate rankings were derived from totaling each city’s violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault as tallied by the FBI plus the number of property crimes of burglary and motor vehicle theft, all in 2011. Then it follows a "multistep process," CQ Press says, in which each city’s reported crimes in each category are compared to nationally reported crimes per 100,000 population rate and "indexed to create a summary score and ranking across" the six areas of reported violent and property crime. After O’Rourke made his claim, we reached Tiffany Medina of SAGE Publishing, which owns CQ Press, who sent an email reaffirming the company’s previous cautionary note. She also pointed us to just such a disclaimer in its 2015 report based on 2013 UCR data, which also says: "The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization. Thus, the analyses in this book are purely descriptive." CQ Press analysis of 2015 statistics Further, we spotted a 2017 CQ Press web post enabling us to determine, based on its crunch of the FBI’s UCR data for 2015, that El Paso then had the lowest, or best, "crime rate ranking" among the 31 cities of 500,000 residents or more that drew a ranking. After El Paso, the cities of New York, Austin and San Diego had the best rankings with Baltimore ranked last in the group behind Milwaukee and Detroit, according to CQ Press. We noticed too that the CQ Press website newly makes it possible to apply a population density filter to its rankings. That is, you can group cities by how crowded they happen to be. And? El Paso and Austin fall out of the big-city rankings if you require a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile. This approach leaves New York, San Diego and San Jose with the best "crime rate" rankings among 21 remaining cities of 500,000 residents or more--with San Antonio at No. 6, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17. Requiring an even greater density (of 5,360 residents per square mile) leaves 10 cities of 500,000 residents or more in the mix. Summing up, per CQ Press, the nation’s most-crowded big cities with the lowest 2015 "crime rate" rankings were: New York; Boston; Los Angeles; Seattle; San Francisco; Chicago; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Milwaukee; and Baltimore--with Texas cities not making the cut. A 2017 FBI cautionary note Among several news stories noted by Meza, a February 2013 Fox News story said the FBI had no comment on CQ’s rankings, "since the agency does not put out the safest cities report nor does it endorse it." That story led us to spot a new FBI cautionary note in a January 2017 agency press release about the agency’s release of its UCR data for January-June 2016: "When the FBI publishes crime data via its UCR Program, some entities use the information to compile rankings of cities and counties. Such rankings, however, do not provide insight into the numerous variables that shape crime in a given town, city, county, state, tribal area or region. "These rankings," the FBI said, "lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that can create misleading perceptions that adversely affect communities and their residents." Crime experts and the latest FBI statistics For our check of the 2013 claim touting El Paso’s safety, criminologist Alfred Blumstein, now a professor emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University, told us by phone CQ Press’s approach--especially its weighting each type of crime the same--made its crime-rate rankings "highly suspect as true indicators of safety." By email, Mitchell Chamlin, a Texas State University criminal justice professor, said at the time that city-level crime rate comparisons weren’t particularly meaningful. "Crime is local," Chamlin wrote, and "most criminals work in a very small radius," typically smaller than a city. We then went a step further by looking at FBI statistics for 2011 to compare rates of violent crime, which includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population that were listed in the 2013 CQ Press report as having the "lowest crime rate" rankings. In 2011 among the selected cities, the FBI statistics suggested, El Paso had the fourth-lowest violent crime rate; the lowest murder rate; and the second-lowest burglary rate. First six months of 2016 After O’Rourke made his claim, we applied a similar filter to the UCR statistics covering January through June 2016, limiting our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population identified by CQ Press as having the lowest crime rate rankings for 2015 (though we substituted No. 11 Seattle for Boston, which evidently didn’t report crime data to the FBI for the six-month period.) Upshot: Among the cities across 10 types of crime reported to the FBI, El Paso had the lowest rates of violent crime; murder; robbery; burglary; and motor vehicle theft. El Paso had the second-lowest incidence of aggravated assault; property crime; arson; and larceny-theft. Finally, per our sort, El Paso had the third-lowest rate of rape. Our ruling O’Rourke said El Paso is the "safest city in the state of Texas, safest city in the United States." This declaration ties to disputed CQ Press rankings, rooted in FBI-published statistics, that appear annually despite the FBI’s advice against using its data to compare communities. The cited rankings also didn't consider every Texas burg nor did they account for differences in population density. We rate O’Rourke’s claim Half True.

pomt-14995	Pollsters say "don't actually believe our own data" and Gallup stopped primary polling "because they don't trust their methodology."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/12/steve-deace/conservative-steve-deace-says-pollsters-dont-trust/	In the Republican presidential nomination contest, polls have been the outsiders’ best friend. Billionaire Donald Trump and physician Ben Carson gained early momentum and critical debate exposure thanks almost entirely to their high rankings in public opinion surveys. What those poll numbers say about Trump and Carson’s chances in the Iowa caucuses and beyond is far murkier. Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace said the polls are meaningless. "The record of polling in Iowa is a joke," Deace said on MSNBC’s News Nation on Oct. 8, 2015. "You’ve got the pollsters now coming out in numerous articles in recent days saying ‘don’t actually believe our own data.’ You have Gallup yesterday made the announcement, they’re pulling out of polling in this primary. They may not even poll the general election because they don’t trust their methodology." A lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace’s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn’t trust its methodology. A cluster of articles Deace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently. Bloomberg wrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters’ questions. The best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That’s a significant cost factor. And then there’s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large. "As response rates have declined, the need to rely on risky mathematical maneuvers has increased," the Bloomberg article said. There was also a report from Politico that carried a warning from pollsters. They said they shouldn’t be the ones "to winnow the GOP field." "Don’t trust polls to detect often-tiny grades of opinion in a giant field," the Politico writer summarized. The point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls’ well-published margin of error. If just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem. But it’s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As the Politico article noted, it’s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls. What’s up with Gallup? So those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace’s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup’s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in another Politico article headlined, "Gallup gives up the horse race." "After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told Politico it isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle," Politico wrote. "And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year." Gallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player. Frank Newport, Gallup’s editor-in-chief, told Politico that the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House. While the article drew a connection between Gallup’s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn’t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story’s broader implication. "Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry," Newport said. "Our post-mortem work in 2012/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016." Taking Newport’s words at face value, worries about Gallup’s methodology did not drive its decision. Deace told us he had not seen Newport’s statement. Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in that context, political polling comes with a risk. "You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November," Franklin said. "If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company." Franklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking. Polling in changing times There’s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It’s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won’t know which ones work best until this election is over, he’s optimistic. "The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012," Forsberg said. "They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004." Polling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones. As for the hurdle of rising refusal rates, Franklin said the survey firms, including his, spend more time getting full interviews. "We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there’s plenty of evidence that we’re reaching enough," he said. Historical trends collected by the National Council on Public Polls, a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points. Jon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I’s and cross their T’s, and those that don’t. "Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate," Krosnick said. "If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point." Krosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate. All that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there’s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries. "We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago," Zukin wrote in an op-ed. A particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the "herding" phenomenon. That’s when polling firms fear to publish results that don’t track with other polls. "Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right," Silver wrote in 538. "In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset." Early polls in a class by themselves From what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn’t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses. Franklin at Marquette University told us for pollsters, that’s the wrong question. "This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game," he said. "It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who's playing well and who isn't. And we still have the second half to play." Franklin said, if you don’t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn’t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process. Our ruling Deace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that Gallup doesn’t trust its methodology. The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can’t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that’s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates. As for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn’t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm’s techniques. It’s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said.

pomt-03453	The IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/19/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-irs-scandal-clearly-showed-so/	There’s broad bipartisan agreement that Internal Revenue Service targeting of tea party and other conservative groups was wrong. But was it criminal? Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., thinks so. During a June 16, 2013, appearance on CBS’ Face the Nation, Rogers said the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior that at least we know was back at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave." While this sounds as if Rogers was accusing White House officials directly of perpetrating criminal activities, host Bob Schieffer pressed him on that claim twice, and both times Rogers denied that he was making that argument. Instead, Rogers told Schieffer that the administration has "admitted that people in the White House knew about this behavior." Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have concluded that Rogers’ overall claim is overblown. We wondered, though, whether Rogers was well-grounded on something more specific -- that the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior." Kelsey Knight, a spokeswoman for Rogers, elaborated on his comments in an interview, saying the congressman "believes the targeting of individuals for their political beliefs at the IRS broke the law. … The ongoing investigations will eventually determine who at IRS was actually guilty of criminal behavior." First, let’s recap what the IRS scandal is all about. As we’ve noted previously, the IRS apologized on May 10, 2013, for singling out tax-exemption applications from groups whose names included "tea party," "patriot" or "9/12." The organizations were seeking exemption from federal taxes either as charitable groups with IRS designation 501(c)3 or as social welfare groups, which are allowed to engage in limited political activity without disclosing donors, under IRS designation 501(c)4. Several factors offer complications for Rogers (and for us) in sorting out what went on inside the IRS. Congressional investigations are still under way, meaning that not all the facts are in evidence yet. In addition, Republicans and Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have been releasing pieces of evidence selectively, in ways that advance their political goals. That said, the inspector general’s report that ignited the scandal doesn’t say anything about criminal behavior. So we checked with experts in criminal and tax law to see if there was something we were missing. Is a criminal case the slam dunk Rogers said it was? The experts we interviewed agreed that there would be a substantial bar to clear before a prosecution could go forward, to say nothing of a guilty verdict being rendered. The experts raised two key issues: The need to prove intent "The key element in any criminal case, in addition to satisfying the statutory requirements, is to establish intent," said Stan Brand, a veteran white-collar lawyer in Washington. "That is typically the most difficult part of any criminal case, because it must be established directly through the acts or statements of the defendant or, more commonly, through circumstantial evidence and inference. … That won't be any easier in the IRS case than any other case." Brand said he hasn’t seen anything yet that is clear evidence of intentional criminal activity, though he added that he’s sure the FBI and Justice Department are looking. What law would have been broken? Finding the right criminal statute to use for prosecuting the targeting of political groups could be harder than it sounds. Elizabeth Kingsley, a Washington attorney who specializes in the tax treatment of exempt organizations, said it’s "a reach to even come up with a statute that applies, much less to find ‘clear’ criminal culpability. I suppose if the facts eventually came out to show that the special scrutiny of those groups was based on an intentional decision to subject certain applicants to harsher scrutiny because of an animus against their racial or religious identity, there might be a case to be made. But it would require evidence to demonstrate such an intent, and we have nothing like that so far." David Weisbach, a University of Chicago law professor who previously worked as associate tax legislative counsel at the Treasury Department, agreed. "I'd be shocked if anything that was done was criminal, because there is no explicit statute on point, and because it appears that the IRS staff actually had quite good reasons for selecting the applications as they did," he said. "Examining the political activity of these groups was their job." Brand said that criminal civil rights violations could come into play "if there was a plan or a plot to intentionally deprive these groups of their tax status based on their political ideas." But it would have to be proven that IRS officials targeted groups for the content of their political beliefs, rather than on the possibility that they would act on those beliefs. Another possibility is the Hatch Act, which limits federal employees from taking part in certain political activities. However, the political activities restricted by the Hatch Act involve partisan politics, and while the tea party groups in question were conservative, they were not officially Republican. Because the key question in the targeting of tea party groups revolves around whether they are primarily "social welfare" organizations, rather than partisan organizations, "it’s hard to see how any delay in processing their applications could be considered partisan political activity," Kingsley said. The laws that could most plausibly support Rogers’ claim are those that address perjury or making false statements to law enforcement, Brand said. But if those laws end up being broken, it would be as part of a cover-up rather than the targeting scandal itself, and in the interview with Schieffer, Rogers referred to criminal activity in the targeting itself. "Clearly, when the government in any way, shape, or form uses its power to intimidate citizens who are donating to whatever their political belief -- Republican or Democrat-- that's a criminal activity," Rogers told Schieffer. Our ruling Rogers said the IRS scandal "clearly showed some criminal behavior," but the experts we interviewed were skeptical that such a threshold has been met, at least for now. Proving a civil rights violation would be hard, requiring evidence of officials’ intent to deny someone’s civil rights. More plausibly, prosecutors could go after officials for false statements or perjury, though it would be a stretch to call that part of the original targeting scandal that Rogers referred to on Face the Nation. In all, experts said Rogers’ use of the adverb "clearly" went too far. If anything, they suggested, "murky" might be a more appropriate descriptor. Not all the evidence is in, but Rogers is pushing the envelope well beyond what is publicly known today. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-12082	"As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/30/matt-gaetz/gaetz-misleads-claim-about-immigrants-crime/	Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told his constituents he supports a crackdown on sanctuary cities because immigrants in the country illegally threaten public safety. "State and local governments that do not comply with our immigration laws are putting American citizens at risk. The facts are clear: the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that in 2014, 75 percent of all criminal defendants who were convicted and sentenced for federal drug offenses were illegal aliens," Gaetz said in an Aug. 18 email newsletter. "As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders." The topic of murders committed by immigrants living unlawfully in the country caught our attention. We found that there is no national dataset tracking this information. U.S. Sentencing Commission report In 2014 immigrants unauthorized to live in the country did account for "roughly 3.5 percent" of the population. In recent years the number of immigrants living in the United States illegally has been estimated at around 11 million. The nation’s total population in 2014 was just under 320 million. Was that 3.5 percent responsible for more than 10 percent of murders in 2014, as Gaetz said? There is no conclusive data supporting this claim. Gaetz’s office pointed us to a September 2015 FoxNews.com report by Malia Zimmerman, headlined, "Elusive crime wave data shows frightening toll of illegal immigrant criminals." "Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants," FoxNews.com reported, though it did not specify to which year those sentences correspond. FoxNews.com reported that there is no federal data presenting a comprehensive picture of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally, and that it reviewed "a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics." Some of the data examined came from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, said the FoxNews.com report. Largely due to a lack of available records, "it is difficult to arrive at any ‘absolute’ or ‘concrete’ rate for crimes committed," Devin Murphy, a legislative correspondent for Gaetz’s office, said via email. He said "more records would be useful in calculating specific crime rates." Gaetz’s newsletter cites U.S. Sentencing Commission findings for 2014, so we took a look at the commission’s data report for fiscal year 2014, which details information on federal sentences including citizenship of offenders per primary offense category. The commission reported that in fiscal year 2014, 75 people were sentenced for murder: 64 of them were U.S. citizens and 11 noncitizen. (The noncitizen category includes "resident alien," "illegal alien," "extradited alien," and "non-U.S. citizen, alien status unknown.") Another, more detailed table provided to PolitiFact by the commission showed that of the 75 people sentenced, 9 of them, or 12 percent, were an "illegal alien." But it’s important to note that murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects crime information voluntarily provided by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. It reported an estimated 14,249 murders in 2014. Information is available regarding the age, sex, race and ethnicity of the offenders, but not on their immigration status. A July 2017 Cato Institute post by immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed out flaws in the FoxNews.com article used by Gaetz’s office to back his claim. "Ms. Zimmerman’s claim that 12 percent of murder sentences were meted out to illegal immigrants in 2014 shows just how misleading it is to rely on partial federal data to make a point about nationwide crime," Nowrasteh wrote. The commission’s report "lists only 75 murderers sentenced to federal prison in 2014, a mere 0.5 percent of the 14,249 nationwide murders committed that year in the United States," he added. The commission’s data is "a very small subset," and most of the serious, violent crime convictions happen at the state level, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California-Irvine, who recently examined 51 studies on the relationship between immigration and crime, mainly finding no correlation. "It is misleading to make assumptions, to make inferences (based on the commission’s report) because it’s such unique data," Kubrin said. Our ruling Gaetz said, "As of 2014, illegal aliens made up roughly 3.5 percent of our population, and committed over 10 percent of all murders." The unauthorized population in 2014 was roughly 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, as Gaetz said, but the rest of his claim is dubious. There is no national, comprehensive report or database tracking the share of murders committed by unauthorized immigrants. A U.S. Sentencing Commission report for fiscal year 2014 attributed more than 10 percent of murders to immigrants living in the country illegally, but that’s for a small subset: federal sentences for 75 people, 9 of whom were classified as an "illegal alien." Murder convictions and sentences are mostly handed at the local and state level, not federal. Gaetz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14780	California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/dec/07/kevin-de-leon/senator-claims-california-grows-jobs-faster-rest-n/	Top California Democrats like State Senate leader Kevin de León often claim that the state’s economy is humming right along — and not weighed down by their ambitious new clean energy requirements. Critics, particularly the oil industry, consider the state’s clean energy push detrimental to California’s economy and job outlook. So, it’s not a surprise that De León, author of the state’s most recent clean energy law, touted California’s strong job growth during a recent speech abroad about climate change. De León, D-Los Angeles, spoke about California’s role as a leader in the fight against climate change to members of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He told them California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe," according to a November press release from the senator’s office. California’s employment picture has certainly improved from the Great Recession, when it lost more than a million jobs from 2007 to 2009. Economists credit a rebound in housing and construction jobs plus strong tech sector growth for the state’s healthier employment figures. But, we wondered, is the state seeing job growth that truly "outpaces the rest of the nation," as the senator claimed? Or did his statement exaggerate the state’s good job news? We set out on a fact check limited to this question. We did not evaluate the additional question of how the state’s clean energy rules have affected California’s job growth. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research Economists we spoke with said De León’s statement, on its face, is correct. They said they took his statement to mean California’s job growth rate was higher than the country’s overall job growth rate. And it is. In 2014, California added jobs at a 3 percent clip compared with the previous year. That was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s overall rate of 1.9 percent during the same period, according to data from Chapman University’s Center for Economic Research. "Overall, the statement is accurate," said Professor Esmael Adibi, the center’s director. "We are outperforming the U.S." And that’s not a new trend, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University. "The state has actually outperformed the country as a whole for 44 consecutive months, which amounts to almost four years," Reaser said. Still, there’s more to the nation’s job picture. Fourteen other states in 2014 had a higher job growth rate than the country overall, according to data provided by the economists. California’s accomplishment was hardly unique. Another interpretation of De León’s claim is that California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states in "the rest of the nation." Asked to clarify the senator’s statement, De León’s office pointed to recent news articles that describe California adding more total jobs than any other state, and adding jobs at a faster pace than the nation overall. Still, the phrase "rest of the nation" is open to different readings, Abibi said. "Is he talking about the U.S. as a whole or is he talking about Texas or North Dakota or Michigan?" the professor asked. That’s significant because five other states had a faster job growth rate than California’s 3 percent last year. They were North Dakota at 3.8 percent; Nevada at 3.5 percent; Colorado at 3.3 percent; Florida at 3.2 percent and Texas with 3.1 percent, according to state and federal data. Senator Kevin De León addresses members of the U.K. Parliament in London. Photo courtesy De León's office. Our ruling State Senator Kevin de León said earlier this month that California has "robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe." We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than "the rest of the nation." We did not evaluate the impact the state’s clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De León’s statement. Economists we spoke with agree that California’s job growth rate has been higher than the nation’s overall average — for several years. Last year, the state’s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that’s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat. And there is another way to read the senator’s statement. One could assume the senator meant California’s job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of "the rest of the nation," and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success.

pomt-02035	"We’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/03/david-frum/david-frum-us-executions-have-dropped-nearly-two-t/	The botched execution of an Oklahoma man has again put a focus on the death penalty in the United States. Bill Maher added his mix of humor and seriousness to the discussion on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher. "Why can’t we just kill people? If you want to kill them, and you want to do it humanely, you can definitely put them out. We’ve all been under," Maher said on his May 23, 2014, show. "Then when you’re under … guillotine, shoot them, leave them in a room with a toddler with a gun, anything. It’s just so easy to take human life. It’s ridiculous." David Frum of The Atlantic tried to bring the conversation back toward seriousness, saying "we’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation." Maher jumped right back in. "We're fifth in the world," Maher said. "Behind China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia." Here, we’re looking at Frum’s claim. (In another fact-check we took up Maher’s retort.) The best information to consider Frum’s claim comes from the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit organization set up to provide information and statistics about the death penalty. The center tracks the number of executions in the United States each year. The death penalty in the United States was suspended in 1972 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Furman vs. Georgia. The court in that case found that a lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The death penalty was reinstated four years later after the court approved more specific sentencing guidelines. Executions started slowly after the death penalty was reinstated then climbed steadily in the 1990s. The number of executions peaked in 1999 at 98 and has been generally declining since. In 2013, there were a total of 39 executions. (Death Penalty Information Center) Compared to the peak year of 1999, the number of executions in 2013 were down by 60 percent. That’s not exactly the figure Frum cited, but it’s close, and Frum hedged his statement by adding "nearly." As for the other part of Frum’s claim, he said the drop happened "over the past generation." That’s right in some instances -- namely from 1999 to 2013 -- but wrong in others. A generation is most often defined as a period of time between 20 and 30 years. From 1993-2013, a period of about 20 years, the number of executions have increased by one (or up 2.6 percent). From 1983-2013, about 30 years, the number of executions have increased by 34 (or up 680 percent). Still, the broader trend line appears clear, and that’s what Frum ultimately was getting at. "The overall trend has been consistently downward over the last 15 years," the Death Penalty Information Center said in a statement. What explains the drop? Part of it is that more states are abolishing the death penalty. Six states have abolished the death penalty since 2007 (New York, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, New Mexico and Illinois). Part of it is a drop off in states that use the death penalty most frequently. Texas executed 40 people in 2000 but has averaged less than 15 executions per year in the past three years. Richard Dieter, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, says the drop-off in Texas may be explained by a 2005 change in the law that gave juries the choice of sentencing murderers to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Before, according to the Los Angeles Times, jurors had to sentence a murderer to die to be assured he would never go free. In Florida, the number of executions has swung with the governor. Jeb Bush presided over 21 executions in eight years in office (1999-2007) while Charlie Crist saw five executions in his one four-year term (2007-11). Rick Scott has overseen 17 executions since taking office in January 2011. "Twenty years ago, use of the death penalty was increasing. Now it is declining by almost every measure," said Dieter, who authored a Death Penalty Information Center year-end report. "The recurrent problems of the death penalty have made its application rare, isolated, and often delayed for decades." Our ruling Frum said, "We’ve seen a remarkable reduction in the number of Americans being executed -- it’s down nearly two-thirds over the past generation." Statistics show that executions in the United States have been generally decreasing since 1999 and are down about 60 percent from 1999 to 2013. Frum could have been more specific on his timeframe, but his point is largely on the mark. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04299	An Obama campaign tactic for rallying voters is to "offer them cell phones."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/31/adam-putnam/putnam-obama-campaign-gives-free-cell-phones-suppo/	An A-team of Florida Republicans packed a Tampa stage Wednesday to welcome Mitt Romney and rally supporters in the final days of the presidential campaign. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio were in the lineup, as well as Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, who warmed up the crowd and encouraged voters to head to the polls early. "Early vote now so that you can wave signs on election day next Tuesday," Putnam said. This is a team sport. This is a team sport. It's fully interactive. We can't just show up and cheer and slap a bumper sticker on the back of our car and think we're done. We've got to drag people to the polls. That's what they're doing. You don't have to offer them cell phones like they're doing." That line about cell phones caught our attention. We decided to investigate. Is the Obama campaign offering cell phones to get voters to the polls? The ‘Obama phone’ myth Way back in 2009, a reader asked us to check out a chain email declaring, "TAX PAYER MONEY IS BEING REDISTRIBUTED TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS FOR FREE CELL PHONES." The email called the phones "Obama phones," suggesting the program was an Obama administration creation. The phone program, the email said, threatened "the very foundations that this country was built on," and "the age old concepts of God, family, and hard work." We learned that there is, in fact, a government program that provides discounted phone service to low-income people, depending on where participants live, through Federal Communications Commission programs. Specifically, a program called Lifeline provides discounts on basic monthly phone service, according to the FCC website. Eligible participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance, or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. Lifeline and programs like it have been around quite a while. Lifeline was created in 1985 and expanded in 2008 during the Bush administration to include cell phone service. An FCC spokeswoman told PolitiFact in 2009 that the 1996 Telecommunications Act required the FCC to create the Universal Service Fund, a pool of money subsidized by small charges on phone bills and redistributed to low-income service programs, as well as programs that bring telecommunications services to rural areas and schools. In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans. New life in the campaign Debunking aside, the "Obama phones" myth re-emerged during the presidential race. In September, video of an unidentified woman protesting at a Romney rally in Cleveland made its way onto some conservative websites, including the Drudge Report. The woman claimed to have received a free "Obama phone." "Everybody in Cleveland -- low, minority -- got Obama phones," she tells an interviewer. "Keep Obama in president (sic). He gave us a phone. He’s gonna do more." The interviewer asks how Obama gave her a phone. Her response: "You sign up if you on food stamps, you on Social Security, you got low income, you disability." Radio host Rush Limbaugh reacted by saying, "She may not know who George Washington is or Abraham Lincoln, but she knows how to get an Obama phone." The Obama campaign also responded, posting a story on its Truth Team website swatting down the rumor and explaining the history of the phone program. The "he gave us a phone" video has become an internet meme, yielding remixes and parodies galore. And earlier this month the group Tea Party Victory Fund released a political ad in Ohio featuring the woman’s rant. Putnam’s response We reached out to Putnam’s spokesman at the Florida Department of Agriculture, Sterling Ivey, for backup to the claim. Shortly after our inquiry, Ivey pointed us to Putnam’s Facebook page, where this note was posted: "About those cell phones: I'd heard about the YouTube video, wasn't aware it was disclaimed. Won't happen again," Putnam wrote Wednesday afternoon. Ivey added: "I think it’s one of those myths that’s obviously grown a life of its own. He wasn’t aware there was a disproving of the statements in the video." Our ruling Putnam told Romney supporters that the Obama campaign is offering cell phones to get its voters to the polls. Internet chatter claiming that Obama gave cell phones to welfare recipients contained a tiny grain of truth: The federal government does have a program to subsidize phone service for low-income people. That program, though, existed long before Obama became president. Putnam then squeezed all reality out of the story, twisting it into an allegation of dirty campaigning. He has since acknowledged the statement was wrong -- but not before announcing it at a high-profile presidential campaign rally. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09884	"Doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, (and) AARP" say that health reform "makes sense to do."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/27/barack-obama/obama-says-there-widespread-support-health-care-re/	In his recent speech, President Barack Obama said the time is ripe for health care reform because most health care professionals support a new plan. "The default position is inertia," he said during his July 22, 2009, speech on health care when asked why he was so eager to pass health care reform before the end of the summer. "Because doing something always creates some people who are unhappy... And the fact that we have made so much progress where we've got doctors, nurses, hospitals, even the pharmaceutical industry, AARP, saying that this makes sense to do, I think means that the stars are aligned and we need to take advantage of that." Obama was talking about some key industry endorsements he picked up for a health care overhaul. In early May, the hospitals, insurers and the drug industry pledged to save $2 trillion in health care spending over 10 years. That victory was followed by a July 8 announcement that hospitals would contribute $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings to cover health care cost reform. So, at first blush it seems that Obama is right that the stars are aligned for health care reform. However, we found that some storm clouds are overshadowing Obama’s starry sky. First, it's important to note that there’s a big difference between supporting a health care overhaul generally and supporting the legislation being considered by the House and the Senate. Nearly all industry sectors believe our health care system needs an overhaul. But they disagree on what to change. Those divisions are best illustrated by industry support or opposition to the House and Senate health care bills. Among many other things, both bills would create a government-run insurance option and would require that most employers extend some sort of health insurance to their employees. People would be required to have some form of coverage, and insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of a person’s medical history. The House bill would tax the wealthiest people to help pay for the legislation, while the Senate hasn't unveiled how it will pay for the overhaul. The American Medical Association — a coalition of doctors and medical societies — endorsed the House bill, because the "legislation includes a broad range of provisions that are key to effective, comprehensive health system reform." However, several of AMA's members, including the Texas Medical Association, have not endorsed the bill because it includes a government-run health insurance option. Another sticking point is an administration proposal that would create an independent group of medical experts to look for inefficiencies in the Medicare system to save money. The American Hospital Association says the plan will hit rural and teaching hospitals hardest because they get extra Medicare payments to help cover their relatively high cost of doing business. AARP supports the House bill, but believes the Senate bill still needs some work. Specifically, the organization, which represents people over 50, is concerned the bill would prevent some less costly generic drugs from entering the market fast enough. The leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, PhRMA, does not support the House bill, but says the Senate bill "marks an important step toward achieving comprehensive health care reform." And the American Nurses Asssociation supports the House bill, but has no clear position on the Senate bill. Those are a lot of details to keep track of, so we've provided you with a handy guide here . But back to Obama's claim. He's correct that most in the health care industry support some sort of reform, but when we're talking about the overhauls that have been put to paper — specifically, the House and Senate bills — there is quite a bit of disagreement among hospitals, nurses, Medicare patients, doctors and the drug industry over which plan is best; industry support isn't as rock-solid as Obama would make it seem. As a result, we give him a Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-27T12:40:17	2009-07-22	['None']
pomt-10088	"Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/01/john-mccain/its-not-welfare/	(Published Oct. 21, 2008) A new Web ad from John McCain's campaign features the ubiquitous Joe the Plumber and attacks Barack Obama’s tax plan as "welfare." "Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none," the announcer says. In the background is the phrase "$100-billion to those that pay no taxes." There are a number of misleading things packed into a tight space here. McCain's claim that Obama's plan will translate to higher taxes for seniors and working families is grossly misleading. As we have pointed out many times , that’s only true if a senior or a family is making more than $250,000 a year, or $200,000 for a single person. Otherwise, it’s generally not the case. Here we will focus on the claim from the ad — repeated by McCain in recent stump speeches — that Obama’s tax plan amounts to welfare. First, McCain is targeting Obama’s plan to enact a number of refundable tax credits. Refundable means the government sends a check if the taxes owed are less than zero. Among the refundable tax credits proposed by Obama: • Under the Making Work Pay plan, a tax credit for wage earners of up to $500. • A mortgage credit equal to 10 percent of mortgage interest for nonitemizers, up to a maximum credit of $800. • A refundable higher education tax credit for the first $4,000 of qualifying higher education expenses. Obama also has proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit for some; as well as the child and dependent care credit. The McCain campaign cites a report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center as evidence that Obama's tax plan would amount to more government giveaways. The Tax Policy Center analyzed Obama’s tax proposals (as described by his economic advisers) and concluded that in 2009, his plan would, in fact, result in $100-billion in government outlays to people who have no income tax liability. That figure would gradually inch up in ensuing years, to $111-billion in 2018. A couple of major caveats are in order. The government already outlays nearly $53-billion to 57-million people (38 percent of all tax filers) who have a zero or negative income tax under current law. A negative income tax means that refundable tax credits amounted to more than the person’s income tax liability, meaning they got a check from the government. The Tax Policy Center estimates another 15-million people would fall into the "zero or negative income tax" category under Obama’s tax plan. Obama’s plan, according to the Tax Policy Center, would add an additional $48-billion in government outlay to those who pay no federal income tax. We think the ad is misleading in that it suggests Obama proposes an additional $100-billion for those who pay no federal income taxes. "There clearly are aspects of the Obama plan that would give to people who pay no federal income tax," said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. But there’s another big hole in the ad’s logic. Obama’s proposed tax credit for wage earners is designed to offset payroll taxes. Those are the taxes withheld from your paycheck for Social Security and Medicare, 6.75 percent of your earnings. All workers pay payroll taxes, even people who pay no income tax. So for McCain to say that Obama’s tax credits would go to people who "pay no taxes" is inaccurate. There are some under Obama’s plan whose tax credits would actually come to more than their income tax liability and their payroll tax liability, but that’s a very small percentage of people, said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. And there’s some hypocrisy here: McCain has proposed a refundable tax credit of his own. McCain proposes a $5,000 tax credit for people to buy health insurance. (We should note that the refundable portion of McCain's health care tax credit must go to a special health spending account so that it only pays for health-related expenses.) Inasmuch as the plan is being sold as a way to help make health care affordable to those at the bottom of the income scale, it too would result in payments to those who pay no income tax. "It absolutely is the pot calling the kettle black," Williams said. We also think it's misleading to call Obama’s plan "welfare." Welfare is a loaded word that connotes government aid to those who aren’t working. Obama’s tax credit for wage earners is just that, for wage earners. We also note that the earned-income tax credit has historically enjoyed strong support from Republicans as well. It was designed, in a way, to replace welfare payments to those who don’t work with government subsidies to low-income people who do work. McCain is not proposing elimination, or reduction, of the existing earned income and child care credits. The existing system results in $53-billion to those who pay no income taxes. Is that support for welfare? McCain is technically accurate when he says that under Obama’s plan, refundable tax credits would result in more people getting a check from Uncle Sam, rather than writing one. But we think it’s misleading to call that welfare. So let's review again the McCain ad's claim in its totality. "Obama raises taxes on seniors (and) hard-working families to give welfare to those who pay none." The claim that Obama will raise taxes on seniors and hardworking families? Misleading. Using the term "welfare" to describe refundable tax credits? Not by most people's definition. That the plan would give payments to people who pay no taxes? Only if you don't consider payroll taxes as taxes. That all adds up to False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-12-01T00:00:00	2008-10-16	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-01724	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/07/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/group-says-sheriff-david-clarke-said-calling-911-n/	A new TV ad by a liberal group uses Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s own words to suggest he’s encouraging gun violence by discouraging use of the 911 emergency response system. "I don’t dial 911," Clarke says in a clip featured in the ad. "I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet.’" The ad ends with another excerpt from that interview: "Point that barrel (at) center mass and pull the trigger." At the top of the spot, a narrator says: "Emergency responders. They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option." Does the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke’s views? Specifically, has Clarke advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option?" A familiar controversy Clarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014. The new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke’s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: "With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?" That prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: "Sheriff David Clarke’s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes." After Clarke’s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there’s an emergency, "I want people to call 911" but Sheriff Clarke is "discouraging people from calling 911, it’s just wrong." About six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview. In that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had "contorted" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911. The sheriff explained that it’s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm. At the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens. He spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home. Twice he said the "advice" he would give people was based on what he himself would do: "Use cover, because you don’t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger." He does not mention calling 911 in that sequence. Then he concludes: "You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that’s why I said it’s not your best option." So the ad, notably, gets the "not your best option" context right. The other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation. Clarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: "We don’t dial 911." "I don’t call 911," Clarke explained. "I will afterwards, to say ‘Come get this dead guy out of my house, he’s bleeding out and he’s messing up my carpet. And that’s not to sound, you know … that’s just the reality. I’m not going to fool around with that. But that’s the mindset I have but I’ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature..." The sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he’d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn’t tell them what to do, he said. "I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do," Clarke said. "If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don’t tell them not to." But he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away. "I don’t think that’s going to be very effective in some of these situations," Clarke said. "So I want people to think about what’s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I’m not running out of my house unless it’s on fire. That’s my house, and I’m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche." Ad vs. reality So how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke’s statements? The ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke’s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke’s own words -- of a home invasion situation. Neither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive). The other Clarke quote in the ad -- "point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger" -- is in fact Clarke’s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn’t always possible and by itself isn’t effective because of long wait times for police. When we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad. Clarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn’t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms. "My position is clear," Clarke said. Our rating A Greater Wisconsin Committee ad said Sheriff David Clarke advised citizens to "point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger" because "911 is not our best option." Clarke did just that in an interview, and made similar comments in an earlier radio spot and in comments to PolitiFact Wisconsin. We rate the claim True.

pomt-08646	"She created the Waste, Fraud and Mismanagement Hotline.... (that) has saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/16/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-she-created-fraud-hotline-has-sav/	Democrat Julie Lassa says she wants to go to Congress to "clean up Washington" and argues she has a record of fighting wasteful government spending from her 12 years in the state Legislature. Lassa’s website invites visitors to save taxpayer dollars by calling the state fraud hotline with reports of abuse -- and touts her role in its creation. Lassa, a Stevens Point Democrat, is running to succeed Democratic U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, elected to the northwest Wisconsin district in 1969. Lassa has been criticized by Republicans as a "Madison insider." Lassa brags about the hotline to tout her legislative accomplishments and underscore her claim that she saves taxpayers money. On the website, Lassa states: "Julie’s Hotline has saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars." So, do her claims ring true? Lassa can claim considerable credit for the hotline. She’s listed as an author of Senate Bill 86 -- along with nine other senators and 11 sponsors in the Assembly. Lassa’s name is first on the list of senators, which indicates she took the lead role in that chamber. The other sponsors (and anyone else who voted for the bill) might have opinions about whether it is "Julie’s hotline." We’ll chalk that up to political puffery but note she’s not the one answering the phone. Now what about the money-saving claim? The campaign said it could not provide a dollar breakdown on the hotline savings and referred us to a Legislative Audit Bureau report on the hotline issued in June. The Fraud, Waste and Mismanagement Hotline (877-372-8317) was created in 2007 and began ringing in the office of the Legislative Audit Bureau in April 2008. A secure e-mail system was added a year later. In 2009, the hotline received 79 reports -- 53 of which came over the phone. In all, the hotline fielded 154 calls between the time it was established and the end of 2009, according to the audit bureau. Some of those calls prompted responses from state bureaucrats and lawmakers. A June 24, 2010 report issued by State Auditor Janice Mueller’s office discusses the 79 reports made during 2009. Some didn’t pan out, many couldn’t be quantified. The one that stirred the most action was about the thickness of concrete used in state road projects. That complaint said a contractor had falsified pavement thickness and smoothness measurements. A similar complaint had been filed in 2004 and investigated by the Department of Justice. That probe was closed in 2008 after the department found "insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges," the audit bureau said. After the report came into the hotline, the audit bureau looked at whether the highway construction program had adequate monitoring safeguards. That led to two legislative hearings and further review from the auditor’s office. Among the findings from the further review: The DOT hired consultants for work that could have been done for $1.2 million less by state workers. The consultants were hired because of a lack of staff. Mueller said in an interview that the call to the hotline "led to significant changes to the concrete program" that will ensure roads last longer. But she said it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on the matter. In any case, any savings from the changes will be in the future. Another hotline call identified problems with overtime payments to state workers. One had his overtime cut from 500 to 60 hours after his bosses took a closer look at his work. Such scrutiny appears to have stemmed a trend of increasing overtime payments, Mueller said. Again, however, it wasn’t possible to put a dollar figure on any savings. So we have a two-part claim. One part is clear, the other part is less so. Julie Lassa did lead the effort to create the hotline, which has generated calls that led to changes. For Lassa’s second statement to be accurate, the hotline needs to have saved taxpayers at least $200,000. There’s no accounting of the actual savings, so we’re left to connect the dots. It seems plausible that the changes in the highway concrete program could one day reach -- or exceed -- that level. The savings in overtime seem likely to be smaller, although still possibly substantial. Regardless, any savings from the calls to the hotline will come down the road. We rate Lassa’s statement Half True.	None	Julie Lassa	None	None	None	2010-09-16T09:00:00	2010-09-15	['Wisconsin']
pomt-09086	"Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/during-primary-angle-said-social-security-cant-be-/	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is facing a tough re-election campaign back home in Nevada. His opponent is Republican Sharron Angle, a former state legislator who also has the support of Tea Party activists. Soon after Angle secured the Republican nomination, the Reid campaign released an ad attacking her positions on Social Security and prison programs. "Social Security. It means independence, a secure income," the ad's narrator says. "But shockingly, Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security." There's a brief clip of Angle saying, "We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out." "She'd cut benefits for everyone coming into the system," the narrator says. "That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?" We addressed the Scientology angle in a separate report. Here, we're looking at whether Angle "wants to wipe out Social Security." First, we should note the ad's video of Angle is edited from a longer statement she made during a May 19 primary debate with other Republican candidates. "We need to phase Medicare and Social Security out in favor of something privatized," Angle said. "We know that the government never gives ... " At this point the moderator interrupted, saying, "Well, don't fix it? You're saying don't do any of these things?" Angle replied, "I'm saying it can't be fixed. It's broken." We also asked the Reid campaign to back up the claims, and it provided us with several news accounts describing Angle as wanting to end Social Security, the government program that sends senior citizens modest monthly checks after they retire. The most on-point story was one from the Associated Press, dated June 1, 2010, that began, "Sharron Angle wants to wipe out Social Security, shutter the Education Department and return to the days almost a century ago when the federal income tax was unconstitutional. ... "Angle calls Social Security 'a broken system without much to recommend it.' She hasn't offered a detailed plan but says seniors now collecting benefits would not be cut off. Workers over time would be shifted to private retirement accounts, an idea that is similar to what former President George W. Bush proposed six years ago only to see it flop." We checked Angle's campaign website and found the following about Angle's position on Social Security: "Free market alternatives, which offer retirement choices to employees and employers, must be developed and offered to those still in their wage earning years, as the Social Security system is transitioned out. Young workers must be encouraged to investigate personal retirement account options." Angle has been asked several times in recent weeks about her views on Social Security, especially about diverting payroll taxes that pay for the program into private investment accounts. Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political reporter, asked her about it on his show, Face to Face. "Privatize social security? People will go crazy about that kind of stuff, won't they?" Ralston asked. "You know, Jon, we all know that Social Security has been broken for years," Angle replied. "The government has been raiding the lockbox and putting in IOUs. We really need to do something that says, going forward -- not right now, because we have some senior citizens that have made a contract with us, we need to be in good faith and complete our contract with them. But going forward, people that are still in the work force right now making their living, they should have a choice between giving that money to the government to take out of that lockbox or keeping the money in a lockbox of their own." Fox News commentator Sean Hannity also asked Angle about the ad on June 14. "Look, Harry Reid is attacking you in this latest ad that he's got out there, saying that you want to phase out Medicare and Social Security. What is your reaction to what he said?" he asked. "Well, it's nonsense. I want to save Medicare and Social Security. I'd like to put some of that money back in the lockbox that he has raided and put an IOU in. He's (had) 20 years to fix Social Security and Medicare. And what we have is an empty lockbox. And what we need is to make our senior citizens feel secure once more with their own Social Security and Medicare. But going forward we need to personalize that program in a way that the government can't go in and raid it any more." Reading all of her public comments, we conclude that Angle supports privatizing Social Security, similar to the plan President George W. Bush put forward in 2005. Bush wanted to allow workers to divert part of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts, typically invested in stocks and bonds. The idea was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference and it would keep the system solvent. Opponents said it was a sneaky way to start dismantling Social Security. But we still have questions about Angle's position on Social Security. Her comments from earlier in the campaign indicate that she thinks Social Security should eventually be ended. Her comments to Hannity and that of her spokesperson imply that private accounts might be optional, as Bush suggested. Reid's ad says Angle wants to "wipe out Social Security" and "cut benefits for everyone coming into the system." During the primary, Angle clearly indicated that she thought Social Security should be phased out, saying, "It can't be fixed. It's broken." Lately, her comments have been less clear, as if she is leaning toward an optional ongoing program. But that was not her position during the primary. Then, she said the program should gradually phase out. So we rate Reid's statement Half True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-06-24T18:26:09	2010-06-12	['None']
pomt-01507	Says President Barack Obama is "sending a much larger (force) " to deal with Ebola "than ISIS is getting."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/23/brit-hume/hume-obama-put-more-force-combatting-ebola-isis/	Before President Barack Obama launched a wave of bombers, fighter planes, drones and cruise missiles against Islamic State at its key bases in Syria, some commentators had disparaged the administration’s willingness to take on the extremist group. On Fox News Sunday on Sept. 21, Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said Obama is "not putting the full effort into" defeating the group also called ISIS or ISIL. "Consider the difference between the president's response to ISIS and his response to the Ebola outbreak," Hume said. "He's sending a large force, much larger than ISIS is getting, to deal with this Ebola outbreak." Hume’s comment came in the context of a discussion over the approximately 1,600 U.S. military advisers and trainers deployed to Iraq to reverse the territorial gains ISIS made there. Via Twitter, we asked Hume to flesh out his claim that Obama is sending "a much larger" force to deal with Ebola "than ISIS is getting." Hume said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "told Congress (the) U.S. has 1,600 troops in Iraq. Obama announced 3,000 to fight Ebola in Africa." The White House announced Sept. 16 that 3,000 troops would help with logistics and setting up medical facilities to contain the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in five West African nations. Prior to the Sept. 22 attacks on targets in Syria, the Pentagon said about 1,600 American troops were in Iraq. The problem is, Hume's claim applied to Obama's overall military strategy to combat ISIS, which involves far more than the 1,600 military advisers and troops he sent to Iraq. "Boots on the ground is a terrible metric," said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that supports larger defense budgets. Gunzinger is a retired Air Force colonel and served in the Pentagon during the administration of President George W. Bush. Gunzinger factors in the airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq. Before Sept. 22, there had been over 170 strikes by American fighter jets, bombers and drones. "A single aircraft carrier has a crew and air wing that can run from 5,000 to 6,000 people," Gunzinger said. "I think it's accurate to say that the level of effort for air and ground operations in Iraq ... far exceeds the level of effort now underway for (the Defense Department)'s humanitarian operations in Africa." A senior Defense Department spokesman also noted the number of soldiers needed to launch airstrikes and pointed to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s inventory of military assets in the region. In a 2013 speech in Bahrain, Hagel said there are more than 35,000 military personnel in and around the Persian Gulf, including a carrier strike group and airbases. Those bases support a range of aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, drones and F-22s. We asked Hume about the airstrikes. He said if one were to count the aircraft carrier crew, one would need to include the personnel needed to protect the 3,000 troops in Africa. However, it is possible that the 3,000 includes that protective force. More broadly, we found a 2011 list of active duty military stationed in Africa, posted by CNN. It showed fewer than 700 troops. U.S. Africa Command currently reports that it has about 2,000 assigned personnel, including military, government civilians and contractors. None of these figures seem to reach the level of troops used against ISIS as of Sunday, Sept. 21. Our ruling Hume said the president is sending a much larger force to deal with Ebola than ISIS was getting. Hume’s statement only holds water so long as you limit the tally to the additional ground forces assigned to each mission. But that framework ignores the airstrikes, the main tool the president had used against ISIS as of Sept. 21, before the strikes were expanded to ISIS targets in Syria. If ISIS was "getting" something, what it got came from forces already in the region, and it seems to make little difference if an ISIS position was destroyed by a soldier newly arrived in the theater or one who had been there a while. At the very least, those strikes relied on carrier-based war planes. According to a former Air Force colonel and the Pentagon, the number of soldiers needed to launch those attacks is larger than the 3,000 troops deployed to fight the Ebola outbreak. We rate the claim False.	None	Brit Hume	None	None	None	2014-09-23T15:34:20	2014-09-21	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-10032	"The president's plan, even after the end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up to 50,000 U.S. troops."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/john-mccain/mccain-says-obama-will-leave-troops-iraqwishful-th/	On the day President Obama unveiled his strategy for pulling out of Iraq, Sen. John McCain offered tepid support from the Senate floor. "I am cautiously optimistic that the plan as laid out by the president can lead to success," McCain said on Feb. 27. "The American people should be clear: The president's plan, even after the end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up to 50,000 U.S. troops." If true, that would be an important vindication for McCain, who argued during the campaign that the United States should station peacetime troops in Iraq for the long term as it has in other theaters. "Maybe a hundred, make it 100 (years)," is how McCain put it at a campaign appearance in January 2008. "We've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed." But did Obama really say he would leave in place 50,000 U.S. troops? In his speech at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Obama said he would "remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months" and "retain a transitional force ... likely (to) be made up of 35-50,000 U.S. troops." We suppose this is the basis of McCain's claim (though his office did not respond to our inquiry). But Obama went on to offer more detail: "Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments," he said. "And under the Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011." So McCain's claim is true only if Obama's "withdrawal timeline" ends at the start of the transitional period beginning in September 2010. That is, McCain was accurate only if he was talking exclusively about the withdrawal of combat troops. Clearly, though, Obama laid out a more complete timeline that extends through the end of 2011, when all U.S. troops are to be out of Iraq. And that timeline effectively rebukes McCain's argument for a long-term troop presence. In a background conversation with reporters, a senior Obama administration official said his aides had rejected the idea of a long-term peacetime presence like that in Germany and South Korea. “The path we're on here, the path is not towards any sort of Korea model,” the New York Times quoted the official as saying. “The path is towards reducing, in a fairly substantial way, U.S. forces in 2010 and then down to what's currently anticipated, down to zero, by the end of 2011." (We prefer not to quote anonymous officials, but feel comfortable doing so here because the statement merely reinforces what Obama said in his speech.) So it was inaccurate for McCain to suggest otherwise. McCain may simply have been speaking imprecisely, rather than trying to claim a policy victory he has not won. Still, we thought it important to note that on the question of a long-term troop presence in Iraq — one of the most fundamental areas of disagreement about the war among policymakers — Obama has thus far rejected McCain's vision, despite McCain's claim to the contrary. We find McCain's claim to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2009-02-27T16:22:58	2009-02-27	['United_States']
pomt-13301	"You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-deleted-33000-em/	The FBI concluded that Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her decision to conduct State Department business exclusively over a private email server, but Donald Trump pledged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the matter if he becomes president. At the second debate between the two presidential nominees, Trump criticized Clinton for turning over half her emails held on her server to the State Department and deleting the rest. He said Clinton should be "ashamed" of herself for deleting 33,000 emails. "There has never been anything like this," Trump said at the Oct. 9 event in St. Louis. "You get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails." Clinton and her campaign don’t dispute that she deleted these 33,000 emails. They argue that these were personal in nature, rather than work-related, and therefore were not necessary to turn over. However, they have denied that they deleted the emails after receiving a congressional subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. But an August 2016 FBI report on its investigation shows that Trump’s claim has some merit. Let’s take a look at the timeline of relevant events, according to the FBI report. (The most pertinent information is on pages 15-19 of this document.) Feb. 1, 2013: Clinton serves her last day as secretary of state. July 23, 2014: The State Department reaches an agreement with the Benghazi committee about producing records for its investigation into the 2012 attack on a U.S. embassy in the Libyan city. Oct. 28, 2014: The State Department sends an official letter to Clinton’s staff requesting "emails related to their government work." Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, and aide Cheryl Mills oversaw the review of Clinton’s email archives to produce work-related documents to the department. Dec. 5, 2014: Clinton’s team provides 55,000 pages of emails, or about 30,000 individual emails, to the State Department. Mills tells an employee at Platte River Networks, which managed the server, that Clinton does not need to retain any emails older than 60 days. March 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal email account while secretary of state. March 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring Clinton to turn over all emails from her private server related to the incident in Libya. Between March 25-31, 2015: The Platte River Networks employee has what he calls an "oh s---" moment, realizing he did not delete Clinton’s email archive, per Mills’ December 2014 request. The employee deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit. March 27, 2015: Clinton’s lawyers send a letter to the Benghazi committee saying that the State Department already has the relevant emails, as they were included in the Dec. 5, 2014, turnover. Trump’s timeline is correct. The congressional subpoena came on March 4, 2015, and an employee deleted the emails sometime after March 25, 2015, three weeks later. However, the implication — that Clinton deleted emails relevant to the subpoena in order to avoid scrutiny — is unprovable if not flat wrong. The FBI’s investigation did find several thousand emails among those deleted that were work-related and should have been turned over to the State Department. However, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 2016 statement that the FBI investigation "found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them." Comey added in a later congressional hearing that the FBI learned no one on Clinton’s staff specifically asked the employee to delete the emails following the New York Times story and subpoena. Rather, the employee made that decision on his own. Clinton told the FBI that she did was not involved in deciding whether individual emails should be sent to State Department, nor "did she instruct anyone to delete her emails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information." Our ruling Trump said, "You (Hillary Clinton) get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena you delete 33,000 emails." Clinton’s staff received a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails March 4. An employee managing her server deleted 33,000 of Clinton’s emails three weeks later. The FBI found no evidence that the emails were deleted deliberately to avoid the subpoena or other requests. Clinton’s team requested for the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena came. They also argued that all the emails that would be relevant to the subpoena had already been turned over to the State Department. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-09941	There are billions of barrels of oil beneath our oceans and in Alaska, and there is ample oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West, but Democrats "say all this American energy is off limits."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/04/john-barrasso/sen-john-barrasso-claims-democrats-against-drillin/	Oil exploration is the subject of a perennial debate in Washington. As gas prices rise during the hotter months, so does the passion to drill for oil in the United States. And once again, Senate Republicans are contending that Democrats oppose domestic drilling. "Even if we double our nation's wind and solar energy, and then double it again, it won't be enough to meet our energy needs," said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, in the GOP's weekly radio address on May 26. "There are billions of barrels of oil in the outer continental shelf and there's even more in Alaska. There's enough oil shale in the Rocky Mountain West alone to power America for the next 100 years. The Democrats say all this American energy is off limits." We've previously checked claims about the extent of drilling , so in this item we'll be examining whether it is correct to say that Democrats, generally speaking, are against oil drilling in the ocean, in Alaska and in the Western United States. Barrasso's words echo a partisan battle from last summer, when gas prices reached $4 a gallon. House Republicans staged a chamber floor sit-in as a way to pressure Democrats into a debate over offshore drilling, which has been off limits in certain parts of the country. Democrats softened their stance at the end of 2008, when they agreed to let the prohibition expire. It's not the first time Democrats have wavered on energy issues. Around the time that Democrats and Republicans were battling it out over drilling, then-Senator Barack Obama backtracked on his opposition to offshore drilling as well. "My attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise," Obama told the St. Petersburg Times . "If it is part of an overarching package then I am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem." Once in the White House, Obama put the brakes on some Bush-era oil drilling plans, including 77 oil and gas leases in Utah. But the Obama administration nevertheless maintains that drilling will be part of the president's larger plan to expand energy production. And contrary to Barrasso's claim, Democrats have voted to loosen the offshore drilling rules. For example, in 2008, 224 of the 231 House Democrats voted for a bill to fund the government until March 2009 that did not include the drilling moritorium, a ban that has been renewed in annual spending bills since 1982. Only one Senate Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, voted against the measure. In fact, some Democrats have been advocates for even more domestic drilling. A year ago, Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Kent Conrad — a Republican and a Democrat, respectively — created a bipartisan coalition to advance energy production in the United States. Included in that plan was language that would allow drilling off the Gulf of Mexico, as well as off the coasts of Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia so long as their state legislatures agreed. The group included Democrats Evan Bayh, Amy Klobuchar, Blanche Lincoln, Mark Pryor, Ben Nelson, Tom Carper and Ken Salazar. Also among supporters was Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu, a longtime supporter of the oil industry, who said she supported the plan because it would allow the country to "begin to drill for oil and gas on vast tracts of American land using American workers and producing American oil and gas." So, Barrasso is wrong to say that Democrats do not support offshore drilling. Plenty of them have in the past, and still do. In Alaska, the issue is the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, a tract of land that could produce upwards of 16 billion barrels oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Environmentalists fought development in that area, saying oil production would ruin the pristine habitat. Obama has long said he is against drilling in ANWR, and that stance has not changed since he has been in the White House. Democratic lawmakers feel the same, as a 2008 Senate vote on a GOP proposal to open up the refuge to drilling illustrates: Every Democrat except Landrieu voted against the plan. On this point, Barrasso is not so far off. As for oil shale, Democrats have taken a wait-and-see approach. In a 2008 op-ed, then Sen. Ken Salazar summed up an opinion held by many of his fellow Democrats, saying that technology was not nearly advanced enough to exploit the oily rock that lies under Colorado, Utah and other Western states, but that the idea shouldn't be ruled out. "Let's put the horse back in front of the cart and all start pulling in the same direction," wrote Salazar, who is now Obama's Interior Department secretary. "A reckless approach that heightens the risk of an oil shale bust would only set us back." And remember those Bush-era oil shale leases we mentioned earlier? After Obama canceled the former administration's effort to sell off land for oil development, the Interior Department announced that it would issue a new round of leases after getting public comment on the issue. So to review our findings: On offshore drilling, Barrasso is incorrect. Plenty of Democrats have supported finding more oil in our oceans. When it comes to drilling in Alaska, Barrasso is on firmer ground, since it is opposed by all but Landrieu. But on the last point — that Democrats don't support oil shale production — Democrats are cautious but not fully against it. So, all in all, Democrats may not be chanting "drill, baby, drill," but they aren't ruling out the possibility either. Barrasso gets a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05487	"Only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/19/jon-obrien/catholics-choice-president-says-only-14-percent-ca/	On April 11, 2012, the Rhode Island House Judiciary Committee took testimony on several bills focusing on the abortion issue, including one that would require a doctor to show each woman seeking an abortion an ultrasound image of her fetus before the procedure (although the woman wouldn't be required to view it). Jon O'Brien, president of Catholics for Choice, was one of the people who presented written testimony to the committee, which held that bill, and others, for further study. One of the statistics he cited caught our eye: "Only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal." We wondered if the support was really that low. We've looked at public opinion on the abortion question before. On February 12, 2012, we found that in most surveys, more Americans regard themselves as "pro-choice" than "pro-life." But the gap is narrow and has gotten smaller over the years. O'Brien was focusing exclusively on Catholics and only on whether they agree with the Vatican's stance, that abortion should be illegal under any circumstance, not whether they consider themselves "pro-life." The "Respect for Human Life" section of the Catechism of the Catholic Church says, "Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law." When we called O’Brien’s office to ask for his source, Catholics for Choice directed us to its 2009 survey of 923 Catholics who were registered voters, a study conducted by Belden Russonello & Stewart. Only 14 percent said abortion should be illegal in all instances. Another 37 percent said it should be legal in just a few cases, 27 percent said it should be legal in most cases and 21 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Among the 356 who said they attended Mass frequently, 31 percent said abortion should never be legal. The rate was 6 percent among the 426 who occasionally attend Mass and 3 percent among the 138 who said they never attend. We came across a 2004 Quinnipiac University poll which found that 17 percent of Catholics said abortion should be illegal in all cases while 16 percent said it should be legal in all cases. Quinnipiac asked the same questions in 2009 and found little change among Catholics; 16 percent wanted abortion to be illegal in all instances while 13 percent said it should be legal in all cases. The Pew Research Center has also looked at the question. Its director of survey research, Scott Keeter, sent us the latest survey, of 2,410 adults -- including 532 Catholics -- conducted from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, 2011. While 16 percent of all respondents said abortion should be illegal in all cases (with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points), 19 percent of Catholics (with a margin of error of 5 points) felt the same way. And the Knights of Columbus released their own survey, done by Maris in December 2011, in which 14 percent of Catholics said abortion should always be illegal. The same percentage said abortion should be available at any time during a pregnancy. Again, in all the surveys we saw, Catholics split along the same lines as non-Catholics and devout Catholics were more likely to agree with the Vatican stance on the legality of abortion. Here's the summary: Catholics say abortion should be . . . Quinnipiac 2004 Quinnipiac 2009 Catholics for Choice 2009 Pew 2011 Knights of Columbus 2011 Always illegal 17% 16% 14% 19% 14% Mostly illegal 31% 28% 37% 26% N.A. Mostly legal 30% 37% 27% 33% N.A. Always legal 16% 13% 21% 18% 14% Our ruling Jon O'Brien of Catholics for Choice said that "only 14 percent of Catholics agree with the Vatican's position that abortion should be illegal." Two polls, one commissioned by his organization and one commissioned by the Knights of Columbus, support that precise number. Other, independent, polls show a bit more support among Catholics for the church's official position, but not a lot, unless the question is posed to the most devout. O'Brien offered a very specific number, without qualifiers. He is very close, especially when you consider that the margin of error grows when such polls pull out the subset of respondents who are Catholic. But because there is some variation, we rate his statement Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-08914	Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal "explicitly voted to fund abortions ..."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/28/erick-erickson/redstatecom-blogger-said-nathan-deal-voted-fund-ab/	The bickering over which Republican candidate for governor is a stronger foe of abortion just won't stop. Last week, Georgia Right to Life accused Karen Handel of supporting abortion if a fetus tests positive for Down syndrome. We gave that claim our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. Now Handel's opponent, Nathan Deal, stands accused of voting to fund abortions while he was a U.S. congressman in 1993. The Deal-Handel runoff is slated for Aug. 10. The winner will face former governor and Democrat Roy Barnes in November. Erick Erickson, an influential blogger and editor of RedState.com, one of the most popular conservative sites on the Web, was the first to make the claim. It appeared Thursday on RedState.com and Erickson's PeachPundit.com, which focuses on state issues. The Macon city councilman supports former Secretary of State Handel's bid. "In Congress, Nathan Deal Voted for Henry Waxman sponsored legislation to give $500 million to Planned Parenthood to pay for actual abortions," he wrote in identical items on RedState.com and PeachPundit posted after 8 p.m. Deal? The candidate who won the endorsement of Georgia Right to Life? He voted to fund abortion with our tax dollars? We fired off an e-mail to Erickson, who replied that the issue has "nothing to do with Nathan Deal who I don't doubt is pro-life." It's more about GRTL's conduct, he said. So we took a look at his blog posts. The earliest item we located was "Georgia Right To Life Supports Candidate Who Voted For Major Abortion Funding," which was posted on PeachPundit.com at 8:14 p.m. An identical one appeared on RedState.com at 8:24 p.m. "Hypocrisy, thy name is Georgia Right to Life," the post began. It then stated a few paragraphs later that Deal voted for the Waxman legislation. Waxman is a Democratic congressman who represents portions of the Los Angeles area. Planned Parenthood runs family planning clinics, some of which perform abortions. Monday, Erickson wrote a 5 a.m. post that repeated the claim. "Deal explicitly voted to fund abortions," it said. Deal voted for the Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives but not the Senate. It never became law. It was an authorization bill, which is a kind of legislation that establishes or re-establishes a government agency or program. It also recommends how much money should be spent on it. This bill would have re-established the Title X program of the Public Health Service Act, which has funded family planning services such as providing birth control since 1970. The beneficiaries are mostly poor women. A portion of those funds go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Title X was authorized in another bill that passed. Amounts set by authorization bills are not binding. The feds don't cut any checks until another type of legislation, an appropriations bill, passes the House and Senate. So the 1993 bill didn't really fund anything at all, much less abortions. Furthermore, the bill had nothing to do with "actual abortions." Title X explicitly states that "none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." This has been the rule since the program began. If a clinic that receives Title X funding also performs abortions, it must make sure none of that federal money goes to those services. For instance, if women getting abortions share a waiting room with those who receive federally funded family planning services, the clinic can't bill the government for the entire cost of running the waiting room. It must subtract the proportion that goes to pay for patients waiting for abortion services. Whether the 1993 bill was anti-abortion is debatable, said Mary Harned, staff counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. That year, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order rescinding what was called the "gag rule," which prohibited clinics from discussing the option of abortion with patients. This bill would have made it more difficult for a subsequent administration to reinstate the rule. Deal received 90 percent and 94 percent ratings from the anti-abortion group National Right to Life during the latter half of the 1990s, which means he supported its agenda almost all the time. It's likely that Deal would not have voted for a similar bill later in his career in Congress, a campaign spokesman said. He has since come to believe that if the federal government provides any funding for Planned Parenthood, it frees up their funds for pro-abortion efforts. During his last two terms in Congress, Deal received 100 percent ratings from National Right to Life. Erickson's claim crumbles in the face of the facts. The Family Planning Amendments Act of 1993 didn't fund anything. What it would have done was re-authorize a federal family planning program that is explicitly barred from funding abortions. Funding for actual abortions was never up for debate, and the bill never passed. Erickson earns a False.

pomt-00593	The USA Freedom Act undercuts privacy because "the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/04/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-freedom-act-means-less-privacy-phon/	Soon, the government will no longer be able to accumulate Americans’ phone records in bulk. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says this doesn’t settle any concerns over privacy. On June 2, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which altered parts of the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law passed soon after 9/11. The most significant aspect of the Freedom Act is that it effectively ends the National Security Agency’s bulk phone records collection program, made public by Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013. Graham, also a presidential candidate, was not present for the final vote on the bill. But in a CNN interview he gave from Manchester, N.H. he said he opposes the Freedom Act and would have preferred to keep the Patriot Act as is. "The (metadata) provisions I don't like at all," Graham said of the Freedom Act in a June 2 interview with Jake Tapper. "Basically, you've undercut privacy now. All of the records will be in the hands of the phone company with hundreds of people available to look at the records versus 20 or 30 people in the government. So I think the (metadata) program has been undermined in terms of the (USA) Freedom Act, and quite frankly, we've told the enemy so much about it, I'm not sure it works anymore." We took a look into Graham’s claim that because of the Freedom Act, hundreds of phone company employees will now have access to the phone records, as opposed to just a couple dozen government employees currently. But here’s the rub: The phone companies have always held this data, and the new law doesn’t change that. As it always was Prior to the Freedom Act, major cell phone providers like Verizon, AT&T and Sprint would steadily hand over all of their phone records to the NSA, which maintains a massive database. The records include information like the location of a call, phone numbers involved and the length of the call, but not the content or audio. Intelligence workers can then run a phone number with terrorist ties through the database to find out who they called and when. Even without the content, phone records metadata can reveal significant information about a person. Government officials have said there are tight restrictions on who can access the database, with Justice Department oversight. Officially, only 22 NSA analysts are allowed to approve a database query, and only 33 can actually access the database. This is the "20 or 30 people in the government" Graham references. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology privacy advocacy group, told us that some people dispute these figures, but they are the best figures we have.) The Freedom Act changes things by keeping these records in the hands of the phone companies. If the government wants to look at a suspected terrorist’s call data, they must get a court warrant first. So in six months, when agencies have implemented the new law, will hundreds of phone companies employees have access to this data who didn’t before? Well, no. The Freedom Act doesn’t change much for phone companies in terms of how they maintain their records, so there is no reason to believe the law would dramatically increase the number of employees with access to the data. "Cellular service providers have always had access to cellular metadata," said Stephen Wicker, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University. "The expiration of various provisions of the Patriot Act has simply eliminated the authority under which the government requested the data from the service providers." Phone companies hold onto these records, in some cases for several years, for business purposes. Per FCC regulations, phone service companies can only access these records with the customer’s permission or if required by law, such as providing information to aid a criminal investigation. We weren’t able to pin down the number of employees who can lawfully access the records. We reached out to Verizon, AT&T and Sprint, and none were able to give us a head count. But with about 175,000 employees at Verizon alone, it very well might be in the hundreds. Phone companies have customer service operators who can access an individual record to provide clients information about their account, and they have teams of lawyers who handle records requests for law enforcement. And an engineer might access the anonymous metadata for planning cell tower placement and optimizing coverage. A spokesman for Verizon, the largest wireless communications service provider, said the company will not increase the number of employees with access to the records. "Verizon takes seriously its commitment to protecting its customers’ privacy, and we have strict protocols that limit access to customer data unless there is a specific business purpose to do so," said Verizon spokesman Ed McFadden. "No additional Verizon employees will need access to those records as a result of the change in law." Graham’s office told us that while phone companies will have the same access to all the data now as they did before, there are other privacy concerns, such as the fact that phone companies will now know things like which phone numbers the NSA is interested in. The Freedom Act does not create any new database for phone companies or require them to keep any information they don’t already keep, though it does require the companies to standardize their records for ease of cross-referencing between carriers, said Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, who called Graham’s claim "bizarre." One might find cause for concern in the possibility that the new system would allow phone company employees to access other companies’ metadata, said Timothy Edgar, a fellow at Brown University’s Watson Institute and a former director of privacy and civil liberties at the White House under President Barack Obama. If the NSA wants to see all the calls connected to a phone number associated with terrorism, that might include calls to numbers belonging to other service providers. But the ideal system would have security measures that would ensure that employees wouldn’t be able to access other companies’ information while still providing the NSA with a full picture, he added. "I see very little prospect that the NSA queries of phone records held under the USA Freedom Act would result in more people having access to phone records than under the NSA bulk collection program," Edgar said. Our ruling Graham said that because of the USA Freedom Act, "the phone records will be in the hands of the phone companies with hundreds of people available to look at the records, versus 20 or 30 people in the government." The premise of Graham’s statement is incorrect. Many phone service company employees already have access to their company’s phone records, and the law doesn’t increase that number. Currently, the phone companies keep their own records, and the NSA collects these records in bulk. The new law eliminates the NSA bulk collection program, but it does not affect how the companies themselves maintain their records, other than some standardization measures. The law does not cause the phone records to change hands, nor does it create new databases or record-keeping systems. We rate Graham’s claim False.

pomt-09303	In 2004, "20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. ... Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/21/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-federal-dole-statistics-omit-important-/	In a recent speech, Paul Ryan, top Republican on the House Budget Committee, made the case that President Barack Obama's policies are only making people more reliant on federal assistance. He used recent passage of the health care overhaul to make his case to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs on March 31, 2010. "A growing centralized bureaucracy will provide for everyone's needs, care for everyone's health, direct everyone's career, arrange everyone's important private affairs, and work for everyone's pleasure," the Wisconsin congressman said. "The only hitch is, government must be the sole supplier of everyone's happiness ... the shepherd over this flock of sheep." Even before Obama entered office, citizens were getting too much help from the government, Ryan contends. According to a 2007 report by the Tax Foundation, he said, in 2004, "20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. In other words, one out of five families in America is already government dependent. Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent of their income from federal programs, so another one in five has become government reliant for their livelihood." Ryan went on to say that more families are supporting themselves "plus - through government - supplying or supplementing the incomes of... other households. As a permanent arrangement, this is individually unfair, politically inequitable, and economically dangerous." On Ryan's latter point, we checked a similar claim made by Sen. John McCain during the presidential campaign. He said that "50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes," a statement we found to be Mostly True. Ryan adds a new dimension to McCain's previous claim, that many people are making much of their income off the government, and we wondered if he's correct. The Tax Foundation report in question looks at data collected between 1991 and 2004. It concluded that in 2004, the federal government's "effective spending rate," or the percentage of household income received from the government, on the poorest households that Ryan refers to in his statement was about 74.5 percent. The federal government's effective spending rate on the second poorest group of households was 38.7 percent. Those figures include benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, housing services, Social Security and welfare programs. We ran Ryan's quote by one of the authors of the report, Gerald Prante, who made two important points. First, he noted that the effective spending rates are an average. So, for instance, some households in the bottom 20 percent are getting more than 75 percent of their income from the government, but some are getting less, he explained. So, it's incorrect to say that each family in that bottom 20 percent is making 75 percent of their income from the government. The same holds true for the second quintile that Ryan also references. More importantly, Prante pointed out that the figure Ryan cited also includes federal spending on public goods -- resources that benefit everyone including national defense, natural resources, and so on. "While technically defense spending could be counted as adding to one's income, broadly defined, the hint that this is all transfer spending is incorrect," he wrote to us in an e-mail. "Part of that 75% is defense spending 'received' by low-income people." In fact, another table in the report shows that, excluding effective federal spending rates on public goods, the poorest households get about 56 percent of their income from the government and households in the second lowest income bracket get about 27 percent of their income from the government. In an e-mail, Angela Kuck, Ryan's Budget Committee's spokeswoman also mentioned that the income from the government drops when you subtract spending for national defense and other costs that all U.S. citizens share. Ryan left out this important detail. Still, although the numbers he cites are arguably inflated, that doesn't negate his underlying point -- that many people are getting a significant amount of their income from the government. But there is another weakness in Ryan's statistics. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, pointed out that the study includes elderly people, who draw heavily on government support in the form of Medicare and Social Security. "Do we want to include the elderly in this picture? Is Social Security a pure transfer? It's not like it's free money," because people spend their whole life paying taxes into those programs, Williams said. The report is pretty up front about that fact. High spending rates in the lowest income brackets are "largely driven by spending on government transfer payments to elderly households — many of whom reside in the lower income quintiles — and other government aid to low income households. Nevertheless, when spending on Medicare and Social Security are removed, lower income households still benefit more from the government than higher income households." So, where does that leave Ryan's claim? It is true that many people get assistance from the government, and many of them are in the lowest income brackets, but Ryan has cherry-picked numbers from the report and omitted crucial information about what the figures represent. The percentage of households getting 75 percent of their income from the federal government is an average; some get more and some get less. Also, a significant chunk of that federal spending is on public goods that benefit every member of society. And a notable number of people who get the most assistance are the elderly receiving benefits they paid for earlier in life. As a result, we find Ryan's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10106	On supporting the Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v. Wade	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/22/john-mccain/mccain-abortion-record-is-consistent/	Back during the Republican primaries, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney accused John McCain of flip-flopping on abortion. Romney was actually defending his own changes of position by arguing that other politicians change position, too. "(McCain) said he was opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade. Now he's for overturning Roe v. Wade," Romney said in April 2007. The charge stems from remarks McCain made on the campaign trail when he was running for president in 1999. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it that year, McCain said, "I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations." Anti-abortion Republicans immediately criticized the statement, and McCain aides started backpedaling, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase “even in the long term.” McCain said in an interview a few months later, “I clearly misspoke there. I’m a person who’s made mistakes in this campaign, and I’ll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.” In South Carolina in 2007, McCain said, “I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.” His Web site also reiterates that stance. "John McCain believes Roe vs. Wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned, and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench," the Web site states. "Constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of Roe vs. Wade, returning the abortion question to the individual states." We find McCain's brief remark of support falls well short of a full-fledged change in position. His voting record on abortion appears to be solidly anti-abortion, though he differs with some anti-abortion advocacy groups on the issues of campaign finance reform and stem cell research, which he supports. On the Flip-O-Meter scale, we rate McCain's position on Roe v. Wade as a No Flip.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-22T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']
pomt-02132	"Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/may/08/blog-posting/florida-democrats-just-voted-impose-sharia-law-wom/	In the final days of Florida’s legislative session, some conservative blogs claimed that they had unearthed the "real" war on women -- a war being waged by Democrats. "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women," read one headline April 30, 2014, on WesternJournalism.com, a blogging platform for "conservative, libertarian, free market and pro-family writers." The story explained: "Anyone who isn’t certain that Democrats are devoted to destroying America need only take a look at their despicable conduct in the Florida Senate. In a vote that never should have had to be taken, every single Democrat voted to force Sharia law on the people of Florida. By doing so, they placed women and children in very real danger. The vote was 24 votes for America and 14 votes for al-Qaida and the Taliban cast by loathsome Democrats." The article said that elements of Sharia law include women being barred from voting, forced marriages for young girls, stoning to death of adulterous women and a requirement that women wear burqas -- the full-body clothing required of women in some very traditional Islamic societies -- when in public. While we were distracted by the close of the legislative session and a hotly contested governor’s race, we somehow missed Democrats voting in favor of burqas and stoning. But readers have made clear to us that they want to know: Did Florida Democrats vote to impose Sharia law on women? What the bill was about It's important to note that claims that "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women" are wrong on many levels -- the first of which is that Democratic lawmakers didn't vote affirmatively for doing any of those things. They voted against a bill that would have barred the use of foreign laws in some contexts, something far more limited. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. At root of the Florida issue is a dispute between a Tampa Islamic center and some of its ousted trustees. In making a ruling on the case in March 2011, a circuit court judge cited Islamic law, sparking outcry from conservatives. That month, two Republican state lawmakers, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, announced they would push for a bill to ban foreign law in Florida courts. After several failed efforts, the bill that passed this year -- Senate Bill 386, "Application of Foreign Law in Courts" -- was watered down compared to previous versions. The bill doesn’t specifically mention Sharia law, and it doesn’t outright ban the use of Sharia law, said Eduardo Palmer, a Coral Gables lawyer who serves on the legislative committee of the Florida Bar’s international law section. But much of the discussion centered on Sharia law. The bill only applies to family-law cases, including divorce, child support and child custody. It doesn’t apply to other areas of law, such as corporate matters. The bill states "A court may not enforce: (a) A choice of law provision in a contract selecting the law of a foreign country which contravenes the strong public policy of this state or that is unjust or unreasonable. ... The purpose of this section is to codify existing case law, and that intent should guide the interpretation of this section." The law allows a judge to agree to apply foreign law as long as it doesn’t contradict public policy in the U.S. For example, if a couple signed a prenuptial agreement in Argentina and later gets a divorce in Florida, a Miami judge could decide to apply Argentina’s law in the divorce case here, Palmer said. But if a foreign law violated our public policy in the United States about child labor rules, for example, then a judge could reject it. "That is the universal standard that most civilized countries adhere to," Palmer said. In reality, the bill doesn’t change existing law, which already allowed judges such discretion. An earlier version would have been much more aggressive -- it would have raised the standards before a judge could have allowed the use of foreign law. A compromise essentially codified existing law. The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which tracks and counters anti-Islamic attacks, and Florida’s Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights anti-Semitism, both lobbied against the bill. Legislators who voted against the bill argued that it was unnecessary and was tantamount to an attack on Muslims. Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, told the House "This bill, this proposal, stems directly from a hatred of Muslims. It's caught on across the country and many other state legislatures have dealt with this, and I find it reprehensible." Waldman called the bill "a solution in search of a problem." A Florida Senate staff analysis in April stated there were six states that currently had laws restricting foreign law in state courts: Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. (An amendment approved by Oklahoma voters that expressly banned Sharia law was ruled unconstitutional, prompting Legislatures to later go with the more generic "foreign law.") The Senate approved the bill 24-14, with all the votes in opposition coming from Democrats. The House approved the bill 78-40, with a majority of Democrats voting "no." (House Democrats who voted "yes" included Daphne Campbell of Miami, Betty Reed of Tampa and Hazelle Rogers of Lauderdale Lakes.) As of May 6, Scott had not signed it into law yet and a spokesman said his office would review the bill. How common and controversial is the use of foreign law in Florida courts? International law experts told us it’s not unusual for foreign law to get used in Florida courts. "Foreign law is applied all the time, in various ways, and it is almost never controversial," said C. Ryan Reetz, a Miami lawyer and chair of the Florida Bar’s international section. For example, parties in international contracts frequently agree to apply a specific foreign country’s law to govern their agreements. "In addition, there is an entire body of law called 'conflict of laws' or 'choice of laws' that governs when the law of a different state or foreign country will be applied to one or more issues in the case," Reetz said. "As in all other states, the Florida courts have developed a series of conflict of laws rules that address this question. This body of law dates back to the founding of our country, and it has been especially well-documented over the last 100 years." In contracts, parties can choose to apply the law of any jurisdiction and the court will accept those laws as long as it doesn’t conflict with our Constitution, said Cyra Akila Choudhury, Florida International University law professor who wrote a paper about states passing anti-Sharia laws. "The Hillsborough case that is referred to was a contract case in which both parties chose shari'ah as the law," she said. "And the court had to give it credence as the freely chosen legal rules by which the contract was to be interpreted. It was no different than if they had chosen German law, or Klingon law." The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida opposed the bill, although spokesman Baylor Johnson said the final version "has relatively little impact on existing law." "Just like some folks think that tinfoil hats will protect you from the imaginary threat of aliens reading your thoughts, the ‘foreign law’ bill won’t protect against the imaginary threat of ‘Sharia law’ taking over Florida, because that threat isn’t real," Johnson said. Our ruling Claims like this one recently circulated on the internet: "Florida Democrats just voted to impose Sharia law on women." Senate Democrats did vote against a bill that prohibits judges from applying foreign law in family-law cases if it contradicts United States public policy. In reality, though, the bill would have essentially codified existing practice. The bill didn’t single out Sharia law, and the United States Constiution still applies. It’s ridiculous -- beyond ridiculous, really -- to suggest that Senate Democrats forced on women such elements of Sharia law as burqa-wearing and stoning to death.

pomt-07475	"A DWI costs $17,000."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/15/texas-department-transportation/txdot-billboard-says-dwi-costs-you-17000/	Along Austin’s Barton Springs Road, home to a stretch of restaurants and drinking establishments, we spotted this head-wrencher on a billboard March 16: "A DWI costs $17,000." Really? A web site listed on the ad, whosdrivingtonight.com, led us to an online video depicting in Twitter and Facebook posts and text messages a Central Texas woman’s Sept. 17 arrest for driving while intoxicated. The video suggests the incident resulted in 12 hours in jail, two years’ probation, 100 hours of community service, drug and alcohol education classes and the loss of her driver’s license. The person, identified as Jessica, also loses her significant other and then her job after her boss requests a meeting about recent absences. Entries from a checkbook register show a pile-up of costs including vehicle towing, bail bonds, attorney fees and court costs. Near the video’s end, the account balance is shown as negative $17,422.60. Take-home message: "Designate a driver." Chasing back-up online, we found an Aug. 16, 2010, press release from the Texas Department of Transportation stating: "Convicted first-time DWI offenders can pay a fine of up to $2,000, lose their driver’s license for up to a year, and serve 180 days in jail. Safety officials say other costs associated with an impaired driving arrest and conviction can add up to more than $17,000 for bail, legal fees, court appearances, court-ordered classes, vehicle insurance increases, and other expenses." The release continues: "Of course, the consequences of driving under the influence can be much worse. In 2009, the latest year of compiled statistics, there were 27,108 alcohol-related crashes in Texas that resulted in 955 deaths and 17,542 injuries (preliminary data)." There’s no discounting the seriousness of drunken driving and its consequences. Still, we wondered how the state reached the $17,000 figure. Tracie Mendez, TxDOT’s driver behavior program manager, guided us to Austin-based Sherry Matthews Advocacy Marketing, which forwarded the summary of a 2006 study it commissioned from an Austin firm, NuStats, on TxDOT’s behalf. Cost estimates were reached, the summary says, based on June 2006 interviews of 30 people. They included a representative of the Texas Department of Public Safety and five DWI offenders plus prosecutors, county clerks and defense attorneys in 15 of the state’s most populous counties including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis, Williamson and Hays.. The summary notes that because individual counties set their own court costs and other fees, "these costs vary throughout the state." Across Texas, the summary states, the "total costs of a DWI arrest and conviction range from $5,000 to $24,000 for a first-time offense." In the Austin area, offenders can pay $6,000 to $21,000 in fines, fees and other costs. Nowhere does the summary specify an average statewide cost--and it cautions against overreaching conclusions. A footnote states: "Due to the qualitative nature of this study, the interpretation of the results is subject to the limitations of the study parameters. While the findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the costs associated with a first-offense arrest and conviction for DWI, the results are not quantifiable." Further, the figures "are not meant to be interpreted as complete and exact." In interviews and e-mails, we fielded different explanations of the $17,000 figure from Matthews’ representatives and one executive, Janet Lea, confirmed that the the online video didn’t reflect an actual event; Jessica is not a real person. Lea also said Clay Abbott of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association had expressed comfort with the $17,000 figure. Abbott, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer, told us he’s a paid consultant to TxDOT and helped the Matthews agency brainstorm and analyze the research. He said his association duties entail training prosecutors and police officers on DWI issues. Abbott confirmed that he endorsed the $17,000 figure, though he also said the high-end attorney fees that showed up in the study struck him as too high. Abbott said he’d be more comfortable with an ad saying a DWI costs up to $24,000, the highest cost figure identified. Yet, he said, "I know attorneys here in town who are really good who would charge a whole lot less ... and not decrease the effectiveness of your counsel." Robert Nash, spokesman for the Matthews' firm, said by e-mail the billboard figure was based on an average of the highest costs for a DWI reported in each of the six studied regions. The actual average approaches $19,200. But "we decided to reduce the amount to $17,000 since not everyone will pay the maximum," Nash said. Mia Zmud, NuStats’ research director, said by e-mail that the research consisted of "structured in-depth interviews" and was not a survey. "As you point out, because of the qualitative nature of the research methodology conducted for this study, the report does not offer a definitive amount," Zmud said. "However, given that the research was conducted 5 years ago, and the costs have likely gone up, not down," $17,000 is a "plausible figure." Separately, we averaged the low-end costs for the regions, getting $6,750. When we averaged the high-end and low-end averages, we got $12,958. Informed of these calculations, Nash said: "We chose to use a number closer to the higher end -- more persuasive." Nash continued: "Our campaign materials refer to the cost of a DWI without specifically calling it out as a first offense. If someone is arrested and convicted for a second or even third time, the fine alone increases substantially. Not factored in our $17,000 are the auxiliary costs of loss of job or time off from work, loss of driver’s license/transportation, the scram device, the big hike in auto insurance rates for teens" and so on. He said too that the $17,000 figure also didn’t include lost income, counseling charges and alternate transportation modes. "However you choose to look at it, a DWI conviction is expensive, whether we believe it’s $17,000, or you prefer another price. If only one person pays $17,000 for a DWI, saying DWI costs $17,000 is a true statement," Nash said. Separately, we shared the study summary with Austin lawyer Sam Bassett, who said by e-mail that he typically charges $5,000 if a DWI case doesn’t go to a jury and up to $10,000 if it does. Abbott told us fines, set at a judge’s discretion, run from several hundred dollars to $2,000, as they did in 2006. We also asked Michael Mahometa, a University of Texas statistician, to analyze the study results’ summary. Mahometa said the sample size was too small for anyone to declare statewide cost figures. "The report was never devised to find how much, on average, are the costs of DWI," he said. Mahometa said an alternative methodology would have been to subtract the $4,792 standard deviation among the regions’ high-end cost totals from the high-end cost average of $19,167, getting $14,375. Yet, he warned by e-mail, a "better measure would be the average for each region," information not in the study summary. Another wrinkle: Since the study was "a snapshot of 'clean' DWIs - no collision, and no injuries... actual cost (if there was a collision or injury) would actually be higher than the $17,000," Mahometa said. So, how to park this puppy? Our conclusion is the research on which the billboard was based doesn’t justify the flat statement that a DWI costs $17,000. Still, it’s undisputed that some DWI cases can cost defendants a bundle--presumably including costs sometimes adding up to $17,000. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/02/vincent-buddy-cianci/cianci-says-when-he-was-mayor-providence-was-named/	During Tuesday’s debate among the three candidates for mayor of Providence, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. responded to criticism about his past criminal record, saying, "I can tell you, I’ve made mistakes." He then pivoted, pointing to positive achievements during his two stints in City Hall, the most recent of which ended in 2002 after a conviction for federal racketeering conspiracy. "But there were no mistakes in the area of developing the City of Providence, creating jobs, when I was mayor," Cianci, an independent, said in the forum sponsored by The Providence Journal and WPRI-TV. "Providence was one of the five renaissance cities of America, according to USA Today in those days. Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America." While such ratings are notable mostly for their public relations value, it’s still quite a collection of accolades for Rhode Island’s capital. We decided to check if they were all true. Let’s go down the list, starting with USA Today. We found a 1996 story from The Journal on USA Today’s selection of Providence as one of America’s "renaissance cities." The Dec. 31, 1996, edition of USA Today profiled Providence as part of a series on cities that had revitalized themselves through "bold and creative approaches," according to The Journal story. The USA Today story chronicled the city’s efforts to preserve its historic landmarks and launch new development initiatives, including the creation of Waterplace Park. The newspaper credited Cianci for Providence’s renewal, according to The Journal. What about Money Magazine and its annual list of the best places to live in America? In 2000, Portland, Ore., was rated the best in the nation, but Providence was one of four regional winners, according to The Journal. The city was named best place to live in the East. It’s worth noting that Cianci wasn’t always happy with Money’s "best places to live" list. After Providence was ranked a lowly 136th out of 300 cities in 1995, Cianci complained in an Op-Ed in The Journal that Money "failed to take into account Providence's resurgence, renewal, ambiance and amenities." (Providence dropped to 198th on the list in 1996 and 240th in 1997. The format for the rankings subsequently changed.) On to the "safest city" claim. This is based on a 1994 story in Parade magazine, according to a Journal story from that year. For the Parade story, John Tepper Marlin, author of the 1992 book "The Livable Cities Almanac," looked at statistics for murder rates, robberies, auto fatalities, overall death rates, air pollution and infant mortality rates. He concluded that Honolulu, Hawaii, was number one and that Providence was number two -- or safest in the continental United States. At the time, critics of the survey pointed out that it looked at only a limited number of factors, not all crime-related. But Cianci was undeterred. "This is really and truly something we as a community can be proud of, and we can brag about it," Cianci said at the time. And he still is. Our ruling In the debate with Democrat Jorge Elorza and Republican Daniel Harrop, Cianci said that Providence was described as a renaissance city during his most recent stint in office and that it was also rated the safest city in America and one of the best places to live. The details are a bit off on a couple of those claims -- where they were made, the actual ranking -- but Cianci is pretty much on the mark. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04285	Says Jim Renacci has "consistently voted" for loopholes that "encourage outsourcing of our jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/02/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-claims-jim-renacci-consistently-suppo/	From President Barack Obama on down to congressional candidates, Democrats this election season are decrying tax loopholes they say benefit companies that move jobs overseas. They cast themselves as protectors of the worker and Republicans as enablers of outsourcing. Of course in politics it’s never quite so simple. Take U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton. The Democrat from Copley Township faces U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in one of only two battles of House incumbents this November. They are fighting for Ohio’s 16th District, which encompasses parts of western Cuyahoga County and parts of five other counties to the south. At a debate Oct. 10, 2012, at the City Club of Cleveland, Sutton moved quickly to tag Renacci with the outsourcer label. Asked about the role of government in creating jobs, Sutton talked of sponsoring legislation to promote the use of U.S. goods in infrastructure projects. Then she shifted into attack mode. "We can also close those loopholes that my opponent has consistently voted for that encourage outsourcing of our jobs and stop ... continuing to support bad trade deals, as my opponent has voted for three bad trade deals that are not going to serve Ohio well in the future," she said. Renacci took exception to the loophole part of the claim. "I’d love for her to tell me one of those loopholes she’s talking about," he said a minute later after answering another question from moderator Mike McIntyre of The Plain Dealer. "I don’t know what those deductions are to send jobs overseas, those loopholes. I’d love to hear it someday." PolitiFact Ohio was curious, too. By way of background, corporate tax rates overseas are typically lower than those in the United States. U.S.-based multinational companies must also pay domestic taxes on foreign profits, but not until they return -- or repatriate -- those earnings to their home country. And many companies, through keen accounting and reinvestment abroad, make sure that never happens. The practice is known as deferral. We found a good primer on this subject posted by Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, a blog from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Let’s also quickly address terminology. A recent item from our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin was helpful here. They note that, as defined by the National Academy of Public Administration, outsourcing is the contracting out of services domestically or internationally. When a company shifts "service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates," that’s called off shoring. What Sutton described seems to fit more under the off shoring, but "outsourcing" is recognized as a catch-all. With that out of the way, let’s examine Renacci’s record. As Exhibit A, Sutton campaign spokesman Anthony DeAngelo offered the Republican budget proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, whom GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has tapped as his running mate. Ryan’s budget sought in part to move toward what’s known as a territorial tax system. Such a system would lift U.S. taxes on foreign profits, meaning that a multinational corporation would not have to pay taxes on overseas earnings it repatriates. Renacci voted in favor of the Republican budget and against the Democratic alternative, offered as an amendment to Ryan’s proposal. The Democratic plan failed in the Republican-controlled House. Ryan’s budget was later blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate. DeAngelo also pointed to Renacci’s vote in favor of the Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012. This also would have moved the U.S. toward territorial taxation. The bill passed the House in August on a largely party-line vote but has not been taken up by the Senate. Proponents of territorial taxation, including Renacci, argue that it would level the playing field with other countries and encourage repatriation. Opponents worry that the system will make it even more enticing for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. Gleckman legitimized these fears, noting that "such a shift might encourage some domestic companies to move more of their operations -- and shift both jobs and more reported income -- to low tax countries." PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on a similar claim by AFSCME. The large public-employees union said in a television ad that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." AFSCME pointed to Thompson’s stated support of the Ryan budget as back-up. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the statement Half True, stressing the following points: Researchers differ on whether U.S. employment would decline under this "territorial" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break. And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home. Renacci has proposed a plan similar to Thompson’s. But before we get to that, let’s first let’s look at other votes the Sutton campaign cites in defense of the congresswoman’s claim. In September 2011, Renacci supported the Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act. The bill, according to the New York Times, stemmed from the National Labor Relations Board’s efforts to block Boeing from opening a South Carolina plant. Republicans produced legislation that would have prevented the board from taking such action. Democrats called it the "Outsourcers Bill of Rights" and argued it would make it easier to shift jobs overseas. And in April, Renacci voted against a package of Democratic amendments to the Small Business Tax Cut Act. One amendment sought to ban tax deductions for companies that have more jobs overseas than in the U.S. This "motion to recommit" failed on a near party-line vote. DeAngelo cited other votes, but some were procedural -- not an up or down vote on an actual bill -- and others didn’t directly address the off-shoring issue Sutton raised at the City Club debate. PolitiFact Ohio found the Ryan budget, the Fairer Tax Code Act, the labor bill and the package of amendments to be the most relevant when evaluating Sutton’s statement at the City Club. As a side note, we have noted before that legislators often face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation. Finally, it’s important to consider a piece of information that even DeAngelo acknowledged: Renacci last November introduced the Returning Investment to America Act. The proposal, backed by two Democratic co-sponsors, aims to incentivize the repatriation of profits made by U.S. companies overseas. Renacci’s bill would relax taxes on these earnings when companies bring them back to the U.S. -- if the companies pour the money into expanded domestic operations or payroll. "American companies have roughly $1.4 trillion in foreign earnings sitting overseas, not being invested in the U.S. economy," one of the Democratic co-sponsors, U.S. Rep. John Carney of Delaware, said for Renacci’s news release. "With high unemployment and a struggling economy, this bipartisan legislation incentivizes companies to bring that money back to the U.S. to reinvest and hire new workers. There are strict mechanisms in place to ensure that only money being used to increase payroll or purchase new assets is eligible for the lower tax rate." In other words, the bill would do the opposite of what Sutton has accused Renacci of supporting. The legislation was sent to the House Ways & Means Committee but never made it to a vote. So where does this leave the congresswoman’s statement? Sutton said that Renacci "consistently voted" for loopholes that "encourage outsourcing of our jobs." The claim is partially accurate, but Sutton’s leaves out important details that would provide key context. Yes, Renacci supports territorial taxation. But researchers are divided on the net effect this would have on U.S. jobs. And Renacci has demonstrated an interest in incentivizing repatriation, introducing legislation of his own legislation toward that end in 2011. This clashes with Sutton’s characterization that he consistently encourages outsourcing. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.

pomt-13094	Roy Blunt "voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress.	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/06/jason-kander/kander-ad-accusing-blunt-voting-raise-his-pay-misl/	Jason Kander, a Democrat running against Republican Roy Blunt for one of Missouri’s U.S. Senate seats, says his opponent "voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress. What are the facts behind this claim? Kander provides sources in this document on his website and even provides quotations from the Congressional Research Service. But providing a source doesn’t necessarily make a claim factual. So we took a deeper look into the legislation itself, and how congressional pay raises occur. In 1989, Congress approved an annual cost-of-living adjustment to member’s pay as part of an ethics reform bill. The yearly adjustment percentage is based on private-sector wage changes and is applied automatically unless denied by a congressional statute. This created a system in which members of Congress can receive pay raises without explicitly voting for them on the record. What Blunt did was vote against measures to stop the yearly pay adjustment from occurring. Each of the times Blunt is alleged to have increased his pay came between 1997 and 2010, when Blunt was still a member of the House of Representatives for Missouri’s 7th District. Here’s how it breaks down year by year. 1997 Blunt’s first year in Washington was preceded by five consecutive years of Congress voting to not adjust their pay, but that streak would not continue. The Senate and House versions of the 1998 Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill (S. 1023 and H.R. 2378, respectively) differed on the inclusion of a pay freeze, with the Senate version supporting no raise. The two chambers agreed to a conference to iron out the differences, with the House voting 229-199 to "order the previous question," which is legalese for ending debate and bringing the measure to an immediate vote. The vote, which Blunt supported, meant that no pay freeze could be added to the bill and sent H.R. 2378 to conference without instructions to stop the automatic pay increase. This led to the Senate wording being dropped from the final bill, which was signed into law on Oct. 10, 1997. Members of Congress’ pay increased 2.3 percent to $136,700. On Oct. 2, 1997, Blunt told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch "I believe keeping the current salary of Congress equal with the rate of inflation is the right thing, and a necessary thing to do to be able to attract people to seek congressional office in the future." 1999 through 2007 From 1999 through 2007, similar actions to those in 1997 were taken in the House to order the previous question before an amendment to stop the pay increase could be proposed. For some of these years, the Congressional Research Service said "it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Members would have voted to deny a pay increase if they had been given an opportunity," as amendments other than the pay freeze were suggested before the House voted to order the previous question. Some years, however, Representatives made clear their intention to introduce a pay freeze before the vote to order the previous question was taken. Every year from 1999 through 2007, Blunt voted in favor of ordering the previous question. As a result of the automatic increases, the pay of members of Congress increased from $136,700 in 1999 to $169,300 at the start of 2008. 2009 On Feb. 25, 2009, the House voted to add a provision to an omnibus appropriations act that would prohibit the automatic pay adjustment for 2010. Blunt was one of only 24 members of the House to oppose this, with 398 members voting in favor of it. Blunt also voted against the omnibus appropriations act as a whole, but this time was joined by 178 members of the House, with 245 members voting in favor of it. As a result, congressional salaries, including Blunt’s, did not increase. 2010 Well into the recession, bills were being proposed to stop pay adjustments for 2011, instead of just tacking the legislation on as an amendment to a larger bill. Blunt voted in favor of one of these bills, which passed the House 402-15 and went on to become law. So Blunt actually voted against the automatic pay increase in 2010. The vote Kander claims is a vote to increase Blunt’s pay this year comes from the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, which froze the pay of some federal civilian employees for two years. While this isn’t a direct vote on his own pay, the 1989 ethics reform bill, which began the automatic pay increases for members of Congress, specifies that their pay cannot be increased by a higher percentage in a year than that of general schedule employees. So a vote against this could be seen as a vote to protect Congressional pay increases, though it may be even more of a stretch than Kander’s prior claims. While Blunt actually voted in favor of this bill when it was passed in the House 415-3, Kander points to Blunt’s vote against the conference bill, which resolved the differences between the House’s and Senate’s versions of the bill as a vote to increase his own pay. This final version of the bill passed the house 193-165 on Dec. 21, 2010. Our ruling Kander said "Blunt voted to raise his own pay 12 times" while in Congress. This is a misleading attack. Blunt did not literally vote to increase his pay 12 times. He voted in support of measures that could have blocked or limited automatic cost-of-living increases from taking effect. Even all of those cases aren’t clear-cut, as sometimes Blunt sided with efforts to stop the automatic pay increase. Kander’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dbb9976c-3393-4a9a-aade-aed04f05f843	None	Jason Kander	None	None	None	2016-11-06T00:49:07	2016-08-10	['United_States_Congress', 'Roy_Blunt']
pomt-01539	Says U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo "supported raising flood insurance rates."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/16/joe-garcia/joe-garcia-says-carlos-curbelo-supports-raising-fl/	As thousands of Floridians faced the threat of a massive flood insurance hike in 2014, a deluge of protests from homeowners led Congress to delay some of the heftiest increases. Now U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, says in a Sept. 5 Web ad that his Republican opponent Carlos Curbelo "supported raising flood insurance rates." That’s a serious charge in Garcia’s district, which includes many homeowners in flood-prone Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. A few days later, the Garcia campaign unveiled a TV ad that makes a similar charge that Curbelo would let rates "skyrocket." We dove right in to search for the facts: Has Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates? Federal and state flood insurance laws in 2014 Congress and the Florida Legislature have taken action on flood insurance during the past few years. But Curbelo, a Miami-Dade school board member, hasn’t participated in those votes. Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that he does not want to get rid of the National Flood Insurance Program but does agree with a new Florida law that made it easier for private companies to step in. The Garcia campaign argues that Curbelo’s comments during two GOP primary debates show he supports raising flood insurance rates. Curbelo’s statements relate to federal and state bills about flood insurance -- we’ll recap both pieces of legislation. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 overhauled the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures more than five million properties nationwide, including about two million in Florida. The bill sought to avoid insolvency for the program -- as of July 2013, it owed about $24 billion. For some policyholders, the bill translated to skyrocketing rates. Residents, well, flooded Congress with complaints, and lawmakers reversed much of their earlier reforms. In March 2014, Obama signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, which lowered the rate increases on some policies and prevented some future increases. The Florida Legislature sought its own solution in 2014. Some private companies were already offering flood insurance, but SB 542 made it easier for them to offer more flexible and potentially cheaper plans. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill in June, but no new companies have started selling policies, and the vast majority remain through the federal program. Experts predict slow growth in the private sector as it will take time for companies to figure out where they can profitably write policies. "It will take a decade well past this November for the private market to emerge slowly," said Jay Neal, president of the Florida Association for Insurance Reform. The two main companies offering private flood insurance in Florida are currently offering cheaper rates than the federal program, said Richard Koon, Florida’s deputy insurance commissioner. But the situation remains in flux -- the national program is expected to revise rates, and some companies might want to see if Congress will make future changes. Curbelo’s debate statements about flood insurance Flood insurance laws emerged as topics in GOP primary debates in Congressional District 26. Here was part of Curbelo’s statement in the June debate: "Our rates here in this district are going up because of things that are happening in other parts of the country. So like with everything else I am for a market-driven solution. We should allow the private sector to step in. Florida already started doing that because Congress failed to address this issue with its supposed fix that Mr. Garcia is going around town talking about. They failed so the state of Florida stepped in and has encouraged private companies to fill this need. So we should continue allowing that process to grow. And again -- when the market fails and only when the market fails -- the federal government should step in to help." During a debate moderated by CBS4’s Jim DeFede, Curbelo (and all the participating candidates) said they would have voted in favor of the Biggert-Waters fix passed by Congress that capped certain annual increases at 18 percent. Curbelo: "I would have voted yes recognizing that it is a bandaid and that it does not solve the long term-problem." DeFede: "I thought though you had given some comments you didn’t think it was Congress’ place to interfere win the market which is essentially what this is doing by capping the increases." Curbelo: "My position is Congress should not interfere with the market unless the market fails. If the market fails, that’s when government intervention is acceptable." A couple minutes later, Curbelo added some criticisms of the federal program: "Florida is a major donor state. We make investments in infrastructure, we prepare for storms in this state and we don’t get a whole lot of credit for it. Florida shouldn’t be treated unfairly under NFIP and that should have been one of the reforms that Congress passed." (A study concluded that several states, including Florida, pay more into the program than they receive in claims.) Curbelo clearly talked about allowing private companies to provide flood insurance. So how does Garcia reach the conclusion that that would raise rates? Garcia points to news articles that explain that historically the federal program kept rates artificially low for homeowners, while private insurance was prohibitively expensive. But some of the articles also showed that it remains to be seen what will happen in the future as private companies enter the market. The Palm Beach Post wrote in March 2014 that supporters of the state bill "portray it as the start of a new era of more flexible, affordable private options." Evan Hecht, CEO of a Gainesville business representing Lloyd's of London syndicates, told the Wall Street Journal that "the proposed (federal) legislation appears to allow potentially millions of people to continue to pay below-market rates, which the private sector wouldn't want to compete with." But the article also paraphrased Paresh Patel, the chief executive of HCI Group in Tampa as saying "that by carefully selecting homes to cover and pairing the protection with a homeowners' policy, HCI could charge less than the new rates and still make a profit." Our ruling Garcia’s ad says that "Curbelo supported raising flood insurance rates." It’s a stretch to imagine a candidate campaigning in Miami and the coastal Keys who would tell voters that he wants to raise their flood insurance bill -- and in reality, Curbelo hasn’t done that. For starters, Curbelo hasn’t taken a vote on federal or state flood insurance. The Garcia campaign says that if Curbelo supports private companies providing flood insurance, that means he supports higher rates. That’s a huge distortion. Curbelo says he supports private companies and in hopes that competition will lower rates. Pushing competitively priced private insurance is not pushing for higher premiums. We rate the statement False.	None	Joe Garcia	None	None	None	2014-09-16T11:48:36	2014-09-05	['None']
pomt-08825	A bill to aid state and local governments "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-state-local-aid-bill-fully-paid-/	On Aug. 10, 2010, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., released a victory-lap press release after her chamber passed a bill to provide $26 billion in aid to states and localities. Pelosi and fellow Democrats touted the bill as a way to save the jobs of 319,000 state and local employees, including teachers and health care workers. Republicans blasted it as more unaffordable stimulus spending and a giveaway to unionized government workers. Ultimately, the bill passed on a near-party-line vote, 247-161, and was quickly signed into law by President Barack Obama. In the news release, Pelosi emphasized that the bill was fiscally responsible. In a series of bullet points, the release said that the bill "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." It added that the bill "reduces the deficit by $1.4 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office." We wondered about Pelosi's statement that the bill is "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." So we turned to the official arbiter of the costs of congressional legislation, the Congressional Budget Office. In its cost estimate, CBO backs up the assertion that the bill is "fully paid-for." Specifically, between 2010 and 2019, the bill is estimated to actually reduce the deficit by $3 million. When you add in an additional year -- making the budget window 2010 to 2020 -- the bill would reduce the deficit by $1.371 billion or, rounded up, the $1.4 billion that the Speaker's release refers to. Case closed? Not quite. The release said the bill "is fully paid-for by closing costly corporate tax loopholes that allow corporations to ship American jobs overseas." That's not the case. According to CBO's analysis, the corporate tax changes in the bill that Pelosi is referring to will amount to $9.8 billion between 2010 and 2020. These are a mix of tax policies that only a CPA could understand, from "rules to prevent splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate" (worth almost $4.3 billion in newly captured revenue) to "denial of foreign tax credit with respect to foreign income not subject to United States taxation by reason of covered asset acquisitions" (worth more than $3.6 billion), to "limitation on the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to section 956 inclusions" (worth $704 million). But that $9.8 billion in corporate tax cuts won't cover the full $26 billion cost of the bill. The bulk of the money comes from something Pelosi's office chose not to mention in the press release -- almost $12 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as the food stamp program) beginning in 2014. Another $1.1 billion would come from cuts to advanced refundability of the earned income tax credit starting in 2011. The earned income credit is a tax credit that benefits the working poor. Several billion dollars more would come from a variety of spending cuts known as rescissions. Some of Pelosi's fellow Democrats complained about the cuts on the day of the vote, even though they ultimately chose to support the bill anyway. "I am outraged by a reduction in Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that is used to pay for this measure," said Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. "Those who receive the meager SNAP benefits are the most poor and the most vulnerable in our society." Said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. "Although this legislation is critically needed, I am greatly disappointed that the Senate included as a 'pay-for,' a provision reducing (stimulus)-enacted increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, beginning in 2014. SNAP provides vital, short-term support to individuals during their greatest time of need, ensuring that there is food on the table for themselves and their children." In the meantime, because few lawmakers like to vote for cuts to programs that serve poor families, some suggest that the food stamp cuts will be rescinded before they take effect. Indeed, Pelosi, in a fact sheet about the bill, said that "House Democrats will work to restore this funding before the cuts are implemented in 2014." The fact sheet did not indicate how that will be paid for. "Of course, no one believes these cuts will be allowed to take place," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "This is fantasy land." So Pelosi's news release is highly misleading because it leaves out the fact that almost half the money paying for the bill comes from cuts to a program very popular with Democrats. It's worth noting that Pelosi has taken reporters' questions about the food stamp cuts, and in a floor speech before the vote, Pelosi said in part, "While I don’t support all of the provisions, I am not happy about the taking money from our energy sector or from food stamps, but I hope that we can, Mr. Chairman, make that up in another way." In addition, the fact sheet sent to reporters by Pelosi's office cited the food stamp cuts. So while Pelosi's release was correct in saying the bill was "fully paid-for," it was incorrect to simply say that came from "costly corporate tax loopholes" (though it wouldn't have had much Democratic appeal if she'd added "and cuts to food stamps.") In reality, not even a majority of the money is from corporate tax provisions. If Pelosi had said this during a fast-paced television interview, we'd be willing to cut her some slack, but this description came from a press release written by her office, so they had ample time and space to explain all of the bill's provisions, as they had in fact done in other contexts. So we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06350	"Every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/	With Republicans in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats don’t have the clout they used to. Hampered in their ability to pass legislation, Ohio Democrats like Betty Sutton of Copley Township are using the bully pulpit of the House of Representatives floor to make points. On Oct. 25, 2011, Sutton and a few of her Democratic colleagues spent a half-hour there sounding off on the topic of job creation and the American dream. Sutton took aim at companies that have moved jobs overseas, and the policies that she says encouraged that action. "Many big companies have not created jobs in the U.S. Instead, they’ve taken many of their jobs to countries with the cheapest labor, the least regulations and few employee rights. This flies in the face of the Republicans’ concern that taxes on the rich means fewer jobs," she said. "On that point, every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories," she said. "Yet here on this House floor, those on the other side of the aisle are content in trying to protect the loopholes that ship jobs overseas." Democrats in Washington frequently discuss the nation’s overseas job losses, but PolitiFact Ohio hadn’t before heard a daily factory closure number. So we checked into it. Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo told PolitiFact that her office used databases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to compute the statistic. The data shows there were 398,887 private manufacturing establishments of all sizes in the United States during the first quarter of 2001. By the end of 2010, the number declined to 342,647, a loss of 56,190 facilities. Over 10 years, that works out to an average yearly loss of 5,619 factories. Dividing that by the 365 days in a year produces a 15.39 average daily number of factories lost. "The congresswoman has always had a very strong focus on revitalizing our manufacturing base and bringing new jobs to Ohio," DeAngelo said. "Because when you look at problems from the deficit on down, a lot of those problems can be remedied, in large part by rebuilding and revitalizing our manufacturing base." Bureau of Labor statistics spokesman Gary Steinberg said Sutton used the correct data to come up with her figure, though her statement would have been more precise if she specified the time period over which the shutdowns occurred. For example, the bureau’s statistics show the nation lost 8,660 factories in 2010, which works out to more than 23 each day that year. The rate was similar in 2009. In 2007 and 2008, roughly 1,500 factories shut down annually, which works out to just four daily closures. DeAngelo said Sutton used the 10-year statistic because it was the most comprehensive number she could find. And while it might have been better if she cited that time period in her speech, her numbers on factory closures add up. "It was a good, comprehensive figure that really showed the depth of our manufacturing crisis in this country and the simple fact that we are losing so many factories and so many jobs every single day over a long period of time," DeAngelo said. It’s worth noting that manufacturing is just one segment of the economy, and that other sectors are adding jobs. For example, the Bureau of Labor statistics employment situation summary for September 2011 showed gains in the health care and professional and business services sectors. Still, a BLS publication called Monthly Labor Review found that manufacturing was one of the hardest hit employment sectors during the last recession, with losses concentrated in the transportation equipment, fabricated metal, machinery, wood product and furniture industries. On the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton’s claim rates True.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2011-11-07T06:00:00	2011-10-25	['United_States']
pomt-04498	Says Romney wants to add $2 trillion to the defense budget that the military hasn’t asked for.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-spend-2-trilllion-military/	With the country facing tough choices on spending and taxes, the defense budget, the largest single area of discretionary spending, plays a special role. In the first of three debates, President Barack Obama tried to pressure Mitt Romney on his defense plans, but the Massachusetts governor did not allow himself to be drawn in. Obama made at least four references to Romney’s goal to greatly ramp up military spending. Each time, he did it in the context of tax policy. "Gov. Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut," Obama said. "On top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for." Romney was happy to rebut the president’s claim about a $5 trillion tax cut but on the military, he said relatively little and he never challenged the president’s number. "We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.," Romney said. "I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military." With both candidates seeking to rein in deficit spending, we thought we should examine whether the governor does want to add $2 trillion in defense spending. Romney lays out his national security policy on his website. There, he warns that restoring the military "will not be a cost-free process," and says he will "begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP." What’s 4 percent worth? The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate. Does Romney mean it The Romney campaign has an interesting response to questions about proposing this increase at a time when the government has a hard time paying its bills. The staff emphasize that it might take some time to get to the 4 percent mark. While the campaign website describes the goal as "a floor", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it "a target" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse "Obama-era defense cuts." In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’ This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that. What the Pentagon is asking for The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military. "We are developing today the Joint Force the Nation will need in 2020," Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. "We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere." Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face. "The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.," Panetta told the budget committee. "We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in." Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said "the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts." The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public. Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military and by and large, the commanders support the plan. "It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this," Bensahel said. Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits. Our ruling The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for. Independent analysts confirm that number, and Romney did not deny it. Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02301	The Koch brothers are "the richest people in the world. Individually, they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/02/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-koch-brothers-are-richest-family-w/	For weeks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been using floor speeches to target Charles and David Koch, the industrialist brothers with libertarian political views who have spent generously -- and gotten others to spend generously -- to support conservative candidates and issues. In an April 2, 2014, floor speech, Reid criticized a House budget proposal drawn up by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., saying it reflected the principles of the Koch brothers and would lower taxes on the wealthy. "Is $80 billion of personal wealth for the Koch brothers enough?" Reid asked. "I think most everyone would say yes, it's enough. But not the Koch brothers. They want more. They're the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world." We wondered: Is that correct? Reid’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this story, but we were able to find some answers. It’s tricky to say definitively who is richer than who, because of privacy issues and fluctuations in market values. But the longstanding yardstick for measuring the world’s richest people comes from Forbes magazine, which publishes both the Forbes 400 (a list of the 400 richest Americans) and the World’s Billionaires (which tracks more than 1,600 billionaires across the globe). Currently, Charles and David Koch, when measured as individuals, are tied for sixth place on the international list, with $40.7 billion each. Combined, their net worth is $81.4 billion, which is higher than the highest-ranking individual on the list -- Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at $77.8 billion. (A third brother, William, has long been estranged from Charles and David, and media accounts about the brothers’ giving patterns generally do not consider him to be part of the "Koch brothers." William is worth an additional $4 billion.) So are Charles and David Koch No. 1 in the world? They’re close--but not quite. Reid ignored one other family that, collectively, has greater net worth than the Kochs: the Waltons, the heirs to the Walmart fortune. Here’s the rundown, in descending order of their ranking on the Forbes international list: 9. Christy Walton and family: $38 billion 10. Jim Walton: $35.6 billion 11. Alice Walton: $35.1 billion 12. S. Robson Walton: $35.1 billion 305. Ann Walton Kroenke: $5.0 billion 367. Nancy Walton Laurie: $4.2 billion Together, the six Waltons have a net worth of $153 billion -- a little less than double the holdings of Charles and David Koch. So if Reid is going to put together the Koch brothers, it makes sense to combine the wealth of the Walton family as well. And the Walton family’s wealth is bigger. Our ruling Reid said the Koch brothers are "the richest people in the world. Individually they're only fifth. Put them together they're the richest in the world."

pomt-05220	Says "As Mayor of Wilsonville, I drove TriMet out of town and replaced their bloated transit system with our own local bus line that offers better service and has saved our businesses millions of dollars."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/07/john-ludlow/did-john-ludlow-mayor-wilsonville-drive-trimet-out/	Taxpayer spending on transit, urban renewal and public safety are just some of the big issues dominating the race between Charlotte Lehan and John Ludlow for Clackamas County chair. Ludlow styles himself as the spending watchdog and crowed recently about how, when he was mayor of Wilsonville, the city dumped TriMet in favor of its own bus system. (TriMet, by the way, is unpopular in some circles.) "As Mayor of Wilsonville," writes Ludlow in a statement posted to his campaign website, "I drove TriMet out of town and replaced their bloated transit system with our own local bus line that offers better service and has saved our businesses millions of dollars." There are many tantalizing strings to follow. Is TriMet a bloated transit system? Is Wilsonville’s local bus system -- called SMART for South Metro Area Regional Transit -- really a money saver? But in the end, what we really wanted to know was this: Did Ludlow run TriMet out of town and replace it with what would become SMART? To answer this, we did some time-traveling into our news archives. We uncovered news stories documenting that in October 1988, the Wilsonville City Council voted unanimously to support a withdrawal resolution from TriMet. The resolution was backed by businesses that argued the city could pay less and get more with its own transit system. In November, the TriMet Board agreed to the withdrawal. And in January 1989, Ludlow was sworn in as mayor, replacing Bill Stark. Ludlow, in other words, was not mayor when the city council voted to dump TriMet. Nor was he on council when TriMet agreed to drop Wilsonville. So how does Ludlow get to claim that as mayor he drove TriMet out of Wilsonville? "It was signed into law when I was mayor," he told PolitiFact Oregon. In fact, he said he recalled presentations in chambers to develop a replacement bus system. "That definitely happened under my reign." We’re certain that as mayor Ludlow oversaw the selection and implementation of a new transit system. SMART’s timeline shows that in 1989, the city signed a contract with Buck Ambulance Service and door-to-door service launched that year. But the critical action took place before Ludlow took office. Businesses weren’t happy paying TriMet for service they deemed inadequate, so they checked state law to figure out how they could go their own way. Ben Altman, a private planning consultant who was on the board of the Wilsonville Chamber of Commerce in 1988, said businesses raised money for a public survey and feasibility study. "We had to do a budget analysis and show how the city could do it as well, or better than, TriMet," he said. The resolution was adopted 5-0 on Oct. 3, 1988. Ludlow was a member of the commerce chamber, but he doesn’t recall spearheading the petition effort. And in any case, that’s not what he said. He said that as mayor, he drove TriMet out of town. We find there’s some truth to Ludlow’s statement: He was mayor when the city officially separated from TriMet and he was mayor when the city sought to find a replacement transit system. But he was not mayor when the city council voted to withdraw from TriMet service, which we find to be the critical moment in the history of Wilsonville and TriMet. We rule Ludlow’s statement Mostly False.	None	John Ludlow	None	None	None	2012-06-07T17:19:52	2012-06-07	['None']
pomt-01999	"Cantor's campaign spent more at steakhouses than Brat spent on his entire campaign."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/11/chuck-todd/rare-feat-cantor-spent-more-steakhouses-opponent-d/	This might not quite be the stat heard round the world, but politicos could not resist passing along one factoid that seemed to capture the improbability of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s, R-Va., stunning defeat in his primary race against Dave Brat. "Cantor's campaign spent more at steak houses than Brat spent on his entire campaign," said Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown. Talk about a claim made for headlines and Twitter. "Eric Cantor: Burned at the steakhouse," said Rolling Stone magazine. "High steaks politics" and "Where’s the beef" popped up in the twittersphere. There’s no disputing the accuracy of the comparison, which first showed up in the New York Times. According to campaign finance data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, Cantor spent $168,000 on fundraising events at three Virginia restaurants -- Bobby Van’s Grill, Bobby Van's Steakhouse, and Blt Steak. Brat spent a little less than $123,000 across the board for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports, which cover spending up until May 21, 2014. Overall, Cantor outspent Brat more than 40 to 1, according to available records, and still lost by 10 percentage points. There’s good reason for the collective astonishment -- this is a rare event. "I can't think of any (case) in which the incumbent's spending advantage was so huge and he still lost," said Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego. Another political scientist, John Sides at George Washington University, has a database with about 9,100 House general election contests. Sides tracks which candidate won and which spent the most money. Being outspent was a clear disadvantage. "In only 10 percent of races did the candidate who got outspent actually win," Sides said. Now, this concerns general elections, not primary contests like the one Cantor lost, but Sides said the pattern wouldn’t change much. Money is a very tangible perk that comes with incumbency. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the odds of a challenger beating an incumbent going back to 1998. In the best year, 2006, challengers who spent $1 million or less, like Brat, had a 1 percent chance of winning. In every other election, their odds were much worse. Our ruling Todd said that Cantor spent more at steakhouses than Brat did in his entire campaign. The latest campaign finance reports back that up. Cantor spent $168,000 on steakhouse dinners to Brat’s $123,000 spent in the overall campaign. We rate the claim True.	None	Chuck Todd	None	None	None	2014-06-11T16:49:42	2014-06-11	['None']
pomt-05179	Say "this biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/14/chris-garrett-bill-kennemer/do-liquor-sales-account-1-billion-state-budget/	In a recent commentary in The Oregonian, two Oregon House members -- a Democrat and Republican -- crossed the aisle to talk about how they’re watching Washington state’s switch to privatizing alcohol sales. In the piece, Reps. Bill Kennemer, R-Oregon City, and Chris Garrett, D-Lake Oswego, say they’ll look at a number of areas as the state examines possible changes to Oregon’s system. Revenue, they note, is a big piece off all of this. "Oregon’s system produces revenue that funds alcohol treatment and other services. This biennium, liquor sales account for nearly $1 billion in the state budget. Regardless of feelings about the state being in the alcohol business, real money is at stake. The impact of regulatory changes on an already strained budget, including funding for our schools and public safety agencies, cannot be ignored." Oregon’s general fund -- the money that legislators most often refer to as "the budget" -- is about $15 billion in all, so that $1 billion figure caught us by surprise. We wanted to know whether it was true. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission is in charge of liquor sales in the state and keeps a close eye on the distribution of revenues. According to its figures, the commission brought in some $460 million in sales, license fees and taxes for the 2010-11 fiscal year. That’s just a single year, though, so the Commission pulls in more than $900 million in a biennium -- nearly the $1 billion that the two representatives mentioned. But here’s the rub: not much of that money goes back into the state budget. More than half of what the Commission brings in goes back into agency expenditures, liquor agent compensation and inventory purchases. The rest gets split among the state, counties and cities and a couple other areas. So, for the 2009-2011 biennium, the state general fund received just under $200 million in liquor sales revenues. We called the representatives to see what had happened with their commentary. Rep. Kennemer was immediately apologetic. "I am embarrassed and sorry," he said. The $1 billion figure came from total revenues, "unfortunately we didn't get the rest of the verbiage corrected." Rep. Garrett offered similar reasoning. "It's a billion-dollar business." It’s true that the representatives had a basis for the $1 billion figure, but to say that liquor sales account for that much of the state budget is inaccurate -- and the representatives realized that when we checked in. We rate this claim False.	None	Chris Garrett and Bill Kennemer	None	None	None	2012-06-14T16:29:39	2012-06-13	['None']
pomt-00687	After laying off 30,000 people, Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, "I would have done them all faster."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/05/anonymous-cyber-squatter/cyber-squatter-accuses-carly-fiorina-30000-layoffs/	Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she’d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her. Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina’s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way: "Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. "So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. "It was this many:" At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins. After much scrolling, the page concludes: "That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently? " ‘I would have done them all faster.’ "—Carly Fiorina" Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn’t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it’s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster. First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders. We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer. We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. "When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from." Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com. But did Fiorina say that she wishes she’d done those 30,000 layoffs "faster"? This is more problematic. It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company’s senior executives after the merger. Here’s an excerpt: "Fiorina summarily fired — within hours — the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn’t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with ‘respect, candor, and compassion.’ But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly ‘dropped the ball.’ She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. … "Under Fiorina (HP) has lost — via firings, resignations, and retirements — a noticeable number of its top people. Here’s one indicator of what some people call the ‘brain drain’: Of the 11 ‘direct reports’ that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC. "Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there’s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she’s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, ‘I would have done them all faster. Every person that I’ve asked to leave, whether it’s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.’ " This puts Fiorina’s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she’s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives. Our ruling The cyber-squatter site claims that after laying off "30,000 people," Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, "I would have done them all faster." While the number is accurate -- acknowledged in a 2006 interview by Fiorina -- the comment that "I would have done them all faster" is pulled out of context. In fact, Fiorina was more specifically referring to her decisions to force out a small number of top-level executives, not tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees. The claim is partially accurate, but takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	Anonymous cyber-squatter	None	None	None	2015-05-05T11:44:19	2015-05-04	['None']
pomt-04503	"Under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-small-business-deba/	Donald Trump is a tycoon who owns luxury high-rises, builds fancy golf courses and stars in a reality TV show. Is it also possible that The Donald is actually a small businessman? President Barack Obama says that's how Mitt Romney would treat him. During the first presidential debate in Denver, Obama attacked Mitt Romney over what constitutes a small business. "Now, Gov. Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth," Obama said. "So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue … the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families." Obama continued, "We do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Now, under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Gov. Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they’re the job creators. They’d be burdened. But under Gov. Romney’s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump doesn’t like to think of himself as small anything, but that’s how you define small businesses if you’re getting business income." The Obama campaign has often tried to remind voters of Romney's relationship with Trump, who has been the most prominent person to question where Obama was born. In TV ads, the Obama campaign has frequently shown a photo of Romney in front of a Trump jet. But was Obama correct when he said that "under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business"? To explore what it means to be a "small business," we'll first discuss whether Trump's companies meet the definition set by the Small Business Administration. Then we'll examine whether Trump would be eligible for a small business tax cut under Romney’s plan. Does Trump qualify as a small businessman? The definition of "small business" is more complicated than you might think. The most common rule of thumb is 500 employees -- a threshold used "for research purposes" by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, an independent advocate for small business within the federal agency. But for loans and other programs, the SBA uses a more complicated standard. The company has to be independently owned and operated and "not dominant in its field." Depending on the industry, the threshold can be either an average number of employees for the past 12 months or a three-year average of revenues. For instance, a manufacturing firm could be considered "small" if it has anywhere from 500 to 1500 employees, depending on the type of product manufactured. Service providers would qualify as small if their annual receipts are lower than $2.5 million to $21.5 million, again depending on the particular service being provided. For retailing, the annual receipts threshold ranges from $5 million to $21 million. So how do Trump’s companies measure up? The Trump Organization didn’t return our queries, but we were able to find a few data points on employment at Trump’s companies. The Trump Organization, the developer’s flagship company, had 22,450 employees in 2007. Several other resort and casino holdings have thousands of employees each, though it’s unclear whether there is overlap among all of these entities. And while there have been disputes over the years about just how much money Trump brings in, it's likely he would exceed any SBA revenue standard. Now, it's possible that some Trump businesses could still qualify as small by the SBA's definition. According to news reports, Trump has some holdings that are much smaller than 500 employees and have relatively modest revenues. In a story about a tax cut proposal from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., the Huffington Post wrote that Cantor’s cut could benefit "Donald Trump's Trump Tower Sales & Leasing, which has 20 employees and annual sales of about $960,000." CNN reported that "Trump also runs a number of other companies that employ fewer than 500" people. According to the SBA, however, a small business affiliated with a large business would not be eligible for an SBA-backed loan. Comparing the Obama and Romney tax plans for small businesses However, even if Trump managed to meet the technical definition of a small business, it’s not accurate to say that Romney’s tax proposal would treat him as a small business. This highlights a fundamental difference in the candidates’ approaches to tax policy. Obama has targeted small businesses by offering at least 16 tax cuts based on a company’s size, frequently limiting the taxes to companies much smaller than the SBA's 500-employee standard. Romney, by contrast, has sought to help small businesses through lower marginal tax rates for individuals. Romney calls lower rates "incentives for job-creating businesses." It's true that conservatives often contend that tax hikes on high earners would hurt small businesses -- not a surprising strategy, since "entrepreneurs" are a more sympathetic group to most people than "the rich." The Obama campaign backs up the president's Trump claim by arguing that hedge fund partners can count as small businesspeople, and that high-powered tax planning can structure very large enterprises in such a way that they’re considered small businesses. We've concluded in a previous fact check that the connection between high earners and small businesses is exaggerated. Still, Obama’s attack during the debate was a bit of a red herring. He implies that a "definition" in Romney's plan would give unique treatment to Trump -- or any "small business" -- when the plan simply reduces rates on all individuals, regardless of whether they own a small business. Other Republicans have advocated targeted small-business tax cuts -- such as the proposal earlier this year by Cantor that "every small business that employs fewer than 500 people" would get a 20 percent tax cut -- but Romney’s main tax proposal is to make a "permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal rates." If Romney harbors any plans for targeted tax cuts for small businesses, he hasn’t revealed them. Why does this matter? Because if Trump ends up getting a cut from Romney, it would be because he’s a taxpayer, not because Romney "defines" him as a small businessman. Our ruling Obama said that "under Gov. Romney's definition ... Donald Trump is a small business." But any tax cuts Trump would get from Romney would have nothing to do with whether he’s a small business or not.

pomt-05936	"I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-ive-never-voted-democrat-when-the/	During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Mitt Romney had to fend off challenges to his record as a conservative, including a series of charges from Newt Gingrich. In the course of arguing his closeness to Ronald Reagan, Gingrich said, "I think it's reasonable to say, and I think (Gov. Romney) said it fairly, I am vastly closer to Reagan. In that period, the governor was an independent business person. In '92 he was donating to the Democrats for Congress and voted for Paul Tsongas in the Democratic primary." Romney countered, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot. And -- and in my state of Massachusetts, you could register as an independent and go vote in (whichever) primary happens to be very interesting. And any chance I got to vote against Bill Clinton or Ted Kennedy, I took. … I have always voted for a Republican any time there was a Republican on the ballot." Is Romney right? Media reports dating back to 1994 -- when Romney first ran as a Republican for Senate -- said that he had acknowledged voting for former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primary in Massachusetts. "An Independent until last December, he publicizes his brief stint as a Democrat to support ex-senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary," wrote David Broder in the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 1994. " ‘I'm not a partisan politician,’ he said. ‘My hope is that after this election, it will be the moderates of both parties who will control the Senate, not the Jesse Helmses.’ " Three days later, the Los Angeles Times’ Ron Brownstein wrote, "When Romney decided to run, Republicans exchanged quizzical looks: ‘We didn't know a single Republican when we jumped in in December,’ his wife, Ann, says. As a registered independent, Romney had voted in the Democratic presidential primary in 1992 to support Paul E. Tsongas (though he backed George Bush in the general election, he says). He briefly considered running for the Senate seat as an independent as well, his wife says, before rejecting the idea as impractical." Romney has faced some difficulty during his two presidential runs explaining his vote for Tsongas. His answer has been that he voted in Democratic primaries -- which are often the only competitive primaries in strongly Democratic Massachusetts -- for strategic reasons On the Feb. 18, 2007, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Romney was asked, "Let me talk about your political journey. You were an independent, registered independent in the 1980s. You voted for Paul Tsongas, a Democrat, in the 1992 primaries. Now you've described yourself as a Reagan Republican." Romney responded, "Kind of a mischaracterization. In Massachusetts, if you register as an independent, you can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. When there was no real contest in the Republican primary, I'd vote in the Democrat primary, vote for the person who I thought would be the weakest opponent for Republican. In the general election..." Stephanopoulos interjected, "So that was a way of supporting President (George H.W. ) Bush, is that what you're saying?" Romney answered, "Look, I've taken every occasion to vote against Ted Kennedy, he's a good friend, but Ted Kennedy, and Tip O'Neill, they're my congressman and senator. I go in their primary, just like a lot of other folks, and voted against the person who I thought was the strongest Democrat. Now, that happens in America today. But let me tell you, in the general election, I don't recall ever once voting for anyone other than a Republican. So, yeah, as an independent, I'll go in and play in their primary, but I'm a Republican and have been through my life. I was with Young Republicans when I was in college back at Stanford. But a registered independent, so I could vote in either primary." This explanation sounds a lot like what Romney said in the Jacksonville debate. But in the debate, he went further and said, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot." On the same day as the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary -- March 10, 1992 -- the Republicans held a presidential primary as well. The incumbent president, George H.W. Bush, won with 66 percent over challenger Patrick Buchanan, with 28 percent. (For the record, Tsongas won 67 percent, crushing once and future California Gov. Jerry Brown with 15 percent and future President Bill Clinton with just 11 percent.) For someone in Romney’s shoes, voting in the Democratic primary did make sense strategically. By the time of the Massachusetts primary, the renomination contest for Bush was all but over, whereas the Democratic contest still had some life in it. Deciding this question requires weighing two distinct interpretations of what Romney did. When Romney walked into the polling place and was handed a Democratic ballot, it’s true that there was no Republican on it. The Republican ballot was separate. So, by this interpretation, Romney is correct that there was no "Republican on the ballot" that day. But there’s another way of looking at it. Romney, as an independent, was eligible to choose which party’s primary he voted in, and he made an affirmative choice to vote in the Democratic primary, not the Republican primary. We checked with the Secretary of the Commonwealth in Massachusetts, the office responsible for running elections in the state. A spokesman confirmed that in 1992 (as is the case today) an independent would have been able to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary on Election Day. So it was within Romney’s power to choose to vote in the Republican primary for either Bush or Buchanan, rather than voting in the Democratic primary for Tsongas. That’s a choice that more than 241,000 Massachusetts Republicans and independents made that day, but Romney didn’t. (A postscript: Tsongas, who died in 1997, didn’t return the favor to Romney. Two years later, when Romney was challenging Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Kennedy got Tsongas to denounce television ads Romney was running against the incumbent. Tsongas’ criticism was effective in "blunting their impact," the Boston Globe reported.) Our ruling In the Jacksonville debate, Romney said, "I've never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot." Romney has been open about the strategy behind his decision, and we expect many voters would have done the same thing. We see two contrary interpretations as having merit. Romney has a point that the ballot he was handed didn’t include any Republicans. On the other hand, Romney had a right to request a GOP ballot that day and opted not to. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-27T16:39:41	2012-01-26	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12252	"Midtown crime is up by 30 percent the last quarter."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/11/rick-baker/did-crime-go-30-percent-midtown-last-quarter/	As Mayor Rick Kriseman boasts about low crime in St. Petersburg, his opponent, former Mayor Rick Baker is firing back with statistics of his own. During an interview with WFLA-Ch. 8, Baker criticized Kriseman’s efforts in Midtown, the area just south of downtown St. Petersburg. A large portion of undecided voters live in Midtown, making it a battleground in the St. Petersburg mayor’s race. The nonpartisan election will be held Aug. 29, 2017. "Let’s get back to the Midtown area, which you brought up before. You’ve also criticized Kriseman for not doing enough for residents there. He says that crime is down by 6 percent and officers are more engaged in the community," WFLA-Ch. 8 anchor Paul Mueller said June 25. "So, with that being said, what else would you do if elected?" "Well the Midtown crime is up by 30 percent the last quarter, so I don't know what statistics he’s looking at," Baker responded. His claim about crime going up made us wonder — what statistic is he looking at? As it turns out, Baker’s claim relies on shaky data. Police department stopped validating location of crimes by neighborhood at the end of 2015 PolitiFact Florida reached out to the St. Petersburg Police Department for a quarterly breakdown of crime in Midtown. The department said they stopped validating the location of crimes by neighborhoods when the police department replaced its crime recording application in 2016. The old system was around 20 years old and failing. While the police department does record the location of calls for service, it does not include the specific neighborhood location on the validated data sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, because the FDLE does not record the data by specific address. Still, the department was able to provide a breakdown of crime in Midtown from 2001 to 2015 when it used the old system. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The number of crimes in Midtown dropped significantly from 2009 to the end of 2015. But the police department was not able to provide crime data for 2016 and 2017 in Midtown, making it hard to assess the accuracy of Baker’s claim. When we told Baker campaign spokesperson Brigitta Shouppe about this, she provided PolitiFact Florida with a breakdown of crime data throughout the city by the first quarters of every year. The breakdown included Midtown. It showed that crime in Midtown went up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2017 (January to March) in comparison to the first quarter of 2016 (January to March). The data includes homicides, forcible sex, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and automobile theft. The 30 percent increase means the number of incidents increased from 544 to 706, according to Baker’s data. The police department could not verify the 2016 and 2017 breakdown provided by Baker. It said the data presented was based on a "working document," and was not ready for release due to the unsubstantiated numbers. Baker was vague about where the data came from, saying only that the police department provided it and that it came without disclaimers. We checked in with community advocates to see if they had noticed recent crime spikes. They told us that crime in Midtown is an ongoing issue of concern, but they had noticed no recent changes. Baker’s evidence relies on uncertain data There are a few problems with Baker’s numbers. First off, experts agreed that if the police department can’t verify the numbers presented by Baker, the data should be treated with caution. And, regardless of whether the data is accurate, experts said there are better practices to understand trends in crime. "Generally speaking, most criminologists would agree that to understand what is driving crime, we need to examine long-term trends," said Lyndsay Boggess, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. "The social and economic conditions that lead to crime are complex and multi-faceted and slow to change." Crime rates fluctuate so even if the increase is accurate in one three-month period, it’s not necessarily a cause for alarm. For example, in the previous quarterly comparison provided by Baker from 2015 to 2016, the Midtown neighborhood saw a 20 percent decrease in crime. If you go back even further, after a decade or so, every year with a first quarter increase in crime was followed by a decrease during the same months in the following year. "The fact that the fluctuations across the years is fairly significant makes me wonder about the accuracy of the data," said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. So, we can’t say for certain whether Baker’s claim is accurate. The police department makes crime data accessible online that shows crimes counts for the city broken down by months, not just the first quarters of every month. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com What about overall crime in the city? During the New Channel 8 interview, the anchor mentioned that Kriseman said that crime had dropped 6 percent. The Kriseman campaign said that figure was in reference to the overall crime in St. Petersburg, not just Midtown. Kriseman’s figure is accurate if you look at the number of crimes that have occurred from 2013 to 2016. According to Uniform Crime Reporting statistics published by the FBI, there were 15,560 total crimes in 2013 (the last year of former Mayor Bill Foster’s term) and at the end of 2016 there were 14,531 total crimes. That’s a little more than a 6 percent drop. But like experts said, it’s better to look at rates, and the FBI breaks those down by violent crime (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.) See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com As you can see, for the most part, property crime and violent crime rates trends have been down since the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Our ruling Baker said that crime in Midtown is up 30 percent in the last quarter. Baker says he got the statistics from the police, but he’s leaving out critical context. Most importantly, the St. Petersburg Police Department stopped validating data with neighborhood location at the end of 2015. The quarter-to-quarter comparison provided by Baker’s team relies on uncertain data and looks at a small time frame. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11230	Says he was "instrumental to passing two (recent) pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for firefighters across the state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/07/mahlon-mitchell/gubernatorial-candidate-mitchell-claims-credit-fir/	The longest paragraph in Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell’s online biography touts his role passing two niche laws affecting Wisconsin firefighters. The reference from his campaign website has also made it into at least one news account as the Madison firefighter seeks the state’s highest office. "Recently, Mahlon was instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state," the biography says, going on to describe the laws on health insurance and infectious diseases. So Mitchell’s claim is not just that he was involved, but that he was "instrumental" in "recent" legislation. Is he right? "Recently" claim a stretch Mitchell, the president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin union, is part of a large Democratic field seeking to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He is making his second run for statewide office, having lost a 2012 bid for lieutenant governor to Rebecca Kleefisch. The laws he references created additional benefits for Wisconsin firefighters or their families in two specific scenarios. 2009 Wisconsin Act 284 established a presumption that firefighters, law enforcement officers and emergency responders who are killed or disabled by an infectious disease contracted the disease through their employment, giving them access to related benefits. 2009 Wisconsin Act 285 required municipalities to pay health insurance premiums for the surviving spouses and dependent children of firefighters who die in the line of duty if they were paying premiums for the firefighter. You’ll notice the year built into the titles of the laws isn’t exactly, well, recent. The laws both were drafted in 2009 and took effect in May 2010. Was Mitchell a key force behind laws? Mitchell’s "instrumental" claim is a bit subjective, but leaning on the dictionary definition we’ll take that to mean Mitchell is claiming a key role in getting the laws passed. A lot goes into making a bill into a law — cue Schoolhouse Rock — but it seems fair to say a key person would be centrally involved with proposing the law, writing the law or pushing for its passage, through things like lobbying or testifying on behalf of the bill. Mitchell was a member of the union’s board when the laws were passed, in charge of outreach and public relations, according to his campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Allen. She said Mitchell attended committee hearings and floor debates in support of the bill and arranged for other firefighters to do the same. And he was part of the group that organized the bill signing. But Mitchell did not testify on behalf of the bills — that was left to other union representatives. And he did not formally lobby for the bills, either, since he was not a registered lobbyist until February 2011. As to the how the laws came to be, drafting records for the health insurance bill show it was introduced by state Sen. David Hansen (D-Green Bay) after the widow of former Green Bay firefighter Arnie Wolff wrote to him about her family’s financial struggles. The bill was drafted by the Legislative Reference Bureau at Hansen’s request and modeled after similar legislation in Illinois. Drafting records for the infectious diseases bill don’t specify the origin of the idea (and Mitchell didn’t claim he proposed it), but show it was drafted by the reference bureau at the request of then-state Sen. Jim Sullivan (D-Wauwatosa) based on a bill in Virginia. The union president who preceded Mitchell, Mike Woodzicka, said the union worked with legislators on the language of the bills, so Mitchell and other board members would have been part of email exchanges on that topic. Jay Wadd, a spokesman for Hansen, said he assumes such a step would have been part of the process on their bill, though he doesn’t have specific records of it given the time that has passed. Our rating Mitchell claims he was recently "instrumental to passing two pieces of legislation that were a huge victory for fire fighters across the state." But it’s a stretch to say the action was recent, and that Mitchell’s role was instrumental. Mitchell’s union supported the bills, and he was involved with supporting them, but there’s no evidence the bills wouldn’t have become law without his involvement. We rate Mitchell’s claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mahlon Mitchell	None	None	None	2018-05-07T06:00:00	2018-04-30	['None']
pomt-08651	Roy Barnes is like Barack Obama because they're both doing a lot of apologizing.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/15/republican-governors-association/barnes-and-obama-sorry-gop-says/	Republicans criticize President Barack Obama for what they call "apologizing" for the United States' actions to countries across the globe. Now they're trying to say that former Gov. Roy Barnes, who is running to reclaim his old seat, is like Obama because he's apologizing, too. The Republican Governors Association makes the accusation in a recent TV commercial. "Our president has traveled the globe apologizing for America," the announcer says. "Our former governor Roy Barnes is traveling the state apologizing for his first term in office." The ad concludes: "Roy Barnes and Barack Obama need to know: Georgians don’t want apologies. They want results." Is Barnes an apologist like our president? Republicans have been playing Six Degrees of Obama with Democrats for much of this midterm election season. They're betting that the closer they link their opposition to the unpopular president the better. Barnes has tried to outmaneuver their attempts for months. In August, he ducked a fundraiser Obama held in Atlanta. Barnes' campaign manager said the former governor wasn't invited, a claim AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants On Fire. As proof of the RGA's accusations, its spokesman Mike Schrimpf pointed us to the group's anti-Barnes website, http://roybama.com. It lists what the RGA considers to be apologies by Obama and Barnes. First, a bit about Obama and apologies. PolitiFact National published an item on similar accusations against the president in a book by former Massachusetts governor and 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney said Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ..." PolitiFact National reviewed seven Obama speeches cited by Romney and ran them by several experts with different points of view. They also looked at previous presidential apologies. They found Romney's statement False. One of the experts PolitiFact National consulted was Nile Gardiner, who co-wrote the list of Obama apologies cited by the http://roybama.com website. Yet PolitiFact National found Romney's notion of what counts as an Obama apology, which aligns with Gardiner's viewpoint, to be invalid. "If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. ... But in our review of his words, we came up short," the item concluded. "Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch." So Obama is not apologizing for America. But what about Barnes? Is he apologizing for his first term in office? The RGA cites three examples, all from videos Barnes' campaign posted on its YouTube page. We'll take them one at a time. "Roy Apologizes" This campaign video, targeted at teachers, is titled "Roy Apologizes." "I apologize. But it was never my intent, and it is not my intent now, not to treasure teachers and learning," he says in the video. He adds that he didn't listen enough to teachers. That's an apology. "Providence" In this TV commercial, which ran during the primaries, Barnes says that "as governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize." Apology? Yes. "Listening" In this video released more than a year ago, Barnes says he has been driving across the state listening to Georgians. He doesn't utter the word "apology." He doesn't say he's sorry, either. Instead, Barnes says he "learned some lessons" since he lost the 2002 gubernatorial election to Sonny Perdue. Barnes says he needs to listen. "Listening is not something I did too much of when I was a governor before. I tried to do too much, too fast. I’ve learned some lessons. I learned I should explain myself more," he says. Apology? This is a tougher call. Barnes acknowledges mistakes and says he is changing his ways. But he never outright says he is apologizing. Overall, though, there's no doubt Barnes is giving a mea culpa. The Barnes campaign said that's what he's doing, and politicians need to look back and assess their actions more often. "Growing up in Sunday school, Roy learned that if you feel you should apologize, you should," spokesman Emil Runge said. And that can be a smart strategy, University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. Former President Bill Clinton used that approach when he lost his bid for re-election after his first term as governor of Arkansas. He spent much of his next campaign apologizing and reclaimed his seat. So the RGA's analogy has some truth to it. Barnes is apologizing for his first term, and he's proud of it. But that doesn't make him like Obama, since the president has not apologized for America's actions. We give the RGA's statement a Half True.

pomt-06462	"The city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/19/dave-yost/dave-yost-says-sb-5-would-save-columbus-41m-year-p/	People on both sides of Senate Bill 5, the controversial overhaul of Ohio’s collective-bargaining law, are fond of general statements that amplify their positions but are hard to quantify. SB 5, supporters say, will save public dollars. But, opponents warn, it will threaten public safety. Rare is the specific number in this polarizing debate. So Ohio Auditor Dave Yost triggered PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity this month when he penned a guest column for The Plain Dealer. Yost, a Republican, wrote in favor of Issue 2, this fall’s ballot referendum on SB 5. A "yes" vote would uphold the GOP-backed law. A "no" vote would repeal the changes. In building his case, Yost noted that SB 5 would require government employees to contribute at least 10 percent of their salaries toward their pensions. The new rules ban "pension pickups" -- a perk in some contracts that calls for the public employer to cover a portion of those costs. Under SB 5, Yost argued, "the city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions. That’s 500 cops and firefighters." The dollar amount is what caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. How Columbus might use the money is purely speculative. We wanted to know if such savings would even exist, especially since more general statements are sometimes made without taking into consideration the fact that many public employees already are contributing significantly toward their pensions. Yost did not cite the source of his $41 million figure in the column. So we dialed up his assistant public affairs director and press secretary, Carrie Bartunek. She referred us to story The Columbus Dispatch published March 6, several weeks before state legislators and Gov. John Kasich approved a final version of the plan. That story showed results of The Dispatch’s analysis on the impact of SB 5. Based on a survey, reporters concluded that, had SB 5 been in effect, central Ohio’s largest government entities would together have saved a $74 million in 2010. Columbus accounted for the biggest chunk in The Dispatch analysis: $50 million. What’s more: "The newspaper’s survey found that most of Columbus’ annual savings -- $41.2 million -- would come from ending the city’s practice of paying much of the employees’ share for pensions." Yost appeared to be right on the nose. But as much as we love it when public officials have faith in what they read in daily newspapers, PolitiFact Ohio decided to double-check The Dispatch’s numbers. That led us to Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman, a Democrat and a fiery opponent of SB 5. Would The Dispatch’s figures hold up under his scrutiny? The $41 million "was accurate at the time the article was published (in March 2011)," Coleman spokesman Dan Williamson said. "We currently have $36.5 million budgeted for the pickup in 2011." Columbus picks up a portion of employee pension contributions under contracts with six unions. Topping the list are workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. They receive a 9 percent pickup, according to numbers Williamson shared. Workers in three other unions get an 8 percent pickup, one union gets 6.5 percent and another 5.5 percent. So what explains the year-over-year decrease in funds budgeted for pension pickups? "In 2009, Mayor Coleman initiated a 10-year reform plan to gradually increase the amount employees pay into their health care and pensions," Williamson explained via email. Bartunek said Yost used the most recent numbers to convey his point. "We’re talking in real time," she told PolitiFact Ohio. "People know that number won’t be the same in five years." Her point is not an invalid one. Contracts are subject to change and expiration, and if Columbus officials can’t negotiate terms more favorable to city coffers, Coleman’s downward projections might not hold. Coleman acknowledges in his 2011 budget that there are assumptions made based on the city’s goals. But whether it’s $41 million, $36.5 million or some other figure, an annual pension pickup savings of $41 million is obviously no lock for Columbus taxpayers. Yost understood such caveats, "but when you’re writing a 500-word column, you’re not going to put all those pieces in," Bartunek said. "There would have to be a lot of qualifiers." So what does that mean for Yost’s claim? His statement is accurate. Columbus would have saved about $41 million had SB 5 been the law in 2010. But for PolitiFact, words matter. Yost’s description was that the city would save $41 million annually. Yost would have been more precise, and only slightly less compelling, had he simply noted that Columbus would have saved $41 million last year. That, in fact, is how The Dispatch referred to the savings. And readers also would have been fully informed had he acknowledged Coleman’s efforts to reduce pickups; Yost’s implication was that without SB 5, the savings would not materialize otherwise. Those are needed points of clarification and additional information. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Yost’s claim Mostly True.	None	Dave Yost	None	None	None	2011-10-19T06:00:00	2011-10-02	['None']
pomt-06090	Congress gave an unelected board "the power to deny care to seniors."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/06/tom-price/price-worries-about-health-care-laws-impact-senior/	For critics of the controversial federal health care law, there are few elements of it that are discussed with as much disdain as the Independent Payment Advisory Board. Rush Limbaugh, for example, has called the 15-member board "death panels." U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, explained some of his concerns about the board in a Dec. 8 letter he sent to constituents of the northwest metro Atlanta district he represents. Several people who received the letter asked us about the veracity of one particular sentence concerning the board. "[T]hey put in place an unaccountable, unelected board of 15 bureaucrats, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board [IPAB], and gave them the power to deny care to seniors," wrote Price, a doctor, underlining that specific part of the letter. So can this board deny care to seniors, as Price wrote? First, what is this board and what can it do? It was created to reduce Medicare spending, if spending surpasses the targeted rate, which is the average of consumer and medical care inflation. Medical inflation has been higher than general inflation 24 of the past 25 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS). Board members are chosen by the president, with advice from the U.S. Senate. Board proposals to reduce spending must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by Sept. 1 of each year and to the president and Congress by Jan. 15 of the following year. The Senate can vote by a three-fifths majority to reject the board’s recommendations, but it then must come up with Medicare spending cuts. Board members should include doctors, employers, health economist researchers and third-party payers and can serve six-year terms. The HHS secretary, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator and the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration are nonvoting members of the board. The board would be required to submit its first proposal to the president and Congress in January 2014 if per capita spending exceeds projections. "[T]he Board is directed to consider, among other things, Medicare solvency, quality and access to care, the effects of changes in payments to providers, and those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid," according to the CRS. The health care law has goals of maintaining or enhancing beneficiary access to quality care. It prohibits IPAB from reducing payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities, long-term care hospitals and hospices until 2020, noted an April report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that researches health policy. The Kaiser report says there could be changes in "Medicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services and durable medical equipment." Another Georgia congressman, Rep. Phil Gingrey, claimed a few months ago that "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy." Those bureaucrats were, yes, IPAB. We reviewed that claim and rated Gingrey’s statement as False. Section 3403 of the health care law noted that IPAB may not submit "any recommendation to ration health care." Price believes costs will exceed projections, which will require cuts to Medicare. The congressman told us that IPAB decisions will likely result in changes such as withholding payment to doctors for certain services, specifically under a formula the federal government uses for Medicare physician payment known as the sustainable growth rate. Some doctors, the congressman believes, will see fewer Medicare patients. Lack of access is equivalent to a denial of care, Price argues. "It’s a cause-and-effect relationship," Price said. The Kaiser report backs up Price’s argument. "If IPAB recommends policies that squeeze Medicare payment rates without equal pressure being placed on private payment rates, there is some concern that Medicare beneficiaries would be at greater risk of having access problems, as providers become more inclined to serve other patients," it says. Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the nation’s private insurance companies, told us that seniors could be impacted by cuts to Medicare Advantage, a health choice program for recipients. Some argue otherwise, and note that Medicare Advantage users will pay slightly less this year for care. Our conclusion Price gets it partially right. The IPAB can push for changes that impact some areas of health care, and that could have an indirect result on care for seniors. The board, however, cannot propose changes that impact the most widely used forms of care -- such as inpatient hospital services, long-term care and hospice -- for Medicare beneficiaries. The IPAB can impact changes to some programs, but not specific care to specific seniors as Price’s statement implies. Price’s concerns have merit, but his statement about the IPAB having the power "to deny care to seniors" needs much more context to be completely accurate. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07129	Democratic tax hikes led $70 billion of wealth to leave New Jersey between 2004 and 2008, and mainly relocate to Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/17/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-blames-democratic-tax-fee-hikes/	When Democratic governors were raising taxes and fees between 2004 and 2008, New Jerseyans took $70 billion of their wealth to other states, Gov. Chris Christie said recently at Princeton University. Christie made that argument during his May 20 speech about the fiscal climate facing New Jersey. When government continues to increase the cost of living and residents subsequently can’t plan their own budgets, "that’s when folks decide just to get up and leave," he said. The governor went on to say that "between 2004 and 2008, at the height of these tax increases and tax expansions and fee expansions in the state government under Jim McGreevey, Dick Codey and Jon Corzine, $70 billion of wealth left the state of New Jersey. "That’s departed wealth, not diminished wealth because of the financial crisis. Departed wealth and departed predominantly to four states – Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania," Christie continued. "What do all four of those states have in common? They all have lower taxes than New Jersey. All of them." PolitiFact New Jersey dug into Christie’s argument that tax hikes led to that migration of wealth, but first, let’s look at the source of the governor’s numbers. The $70 billion figure comes from a January 2010 report on migrating households by a research center at Boston College. From 2004 to 2008, about $117 billion of wealth came into New Jersey and about $187 billion left the state, causing a net reduction of about $70 billion. So that number is right. Christie is slightly off when it comes to the top four destination states of that departed wealth, according to the report. Based on the percentage of departing households, the top four states were Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and North Carolina. Based on the percentage of wealth, the top four states were Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and California. Between those two measures, the governor is leaving out New York and California. Christie, however, is right that New Jersey’s tax burden exceeds other states. New Jersey ranked the highest among states as of 2009 for the percentage of per-capita income spent on state and local taxes, according to the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a pro-business research group. And from 2004 to 2008, New Jersey’s state-local tax burden increased every year. Now, here’s the tougher question -- did New Jersey’s tax increases really chase away that $70 billion of wealth? We asked Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts in two emails to provide evidence, but he never did. "The Governor’s remarks concerning the study and his argument made concerning the impact of tax policies speak for themselves," Roberts wrote to us. The Boston College study provides a mix of reasons for migration, based on federal data. Based on that analysis, family- and job-related matters topped the reasons for leaving New Jersey from 2004 to 2008. PolitiFact New Jersey also reached out to three experts and consulted four other studies on migration, and a varied picture emerged of the impact of higher taxes. A 2007 report from the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University said high taxes were among the reasons driving people from New Jersey. According to a 2008 report out of Princeton University, New Jerseyans move to states with lower property taxes and lower costs of living. "Our conclusion is that migration out of New Jersey is based on the very high cost of housing in the state (of which property taxes are an element)," Stanford University professor Cristobal Young, one of the authors of that 2008 report, wrote in an email. "Retirement-based migration is also important, as shown by the large flows of people to Florida." Those studies support the argument that high taxes contribute to migration, but other research suggests the impact has been minimal. A recent study -- by Young and a Princeton graduate student -- reached that conclusion in regard to a 2004 tax increase on high income earners. Joel Slemrod, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, who also found a minimal effect of taxes on migration in his own study, said the financial environment is just one aspect of many that people consider in where to live. Another factor is the quality of services in a given location, Slemrod said. "You have to look at both sides of the government ledger," Slemrod said. According to University of Massachusetts, Amherst professor Jeffrey Thompson, higher taxes don’t push people out of a state, because of the value placed on the services and the small nature of the tax increases when compared with moving costs. But higher taxes also can keep people from moving into a state, Thompson said. If states use the additional tax revenue to create jobs and reduce crime, they can overcome the unattractiveness of the higher taxes, Thompson said. Going back to Christie’s statement, let’s review: The governor blamed Democratic tax hikes for chasing away $70 billion of wealth from 2004 to 2008. Christie was not completely accurate about the destination states for the departed wealth, leaving out New York and California. Several experts agree higher taxes play a role in migration, but the governor’s spokesman couldn’t provide any specific evidence of that, and some research has found the impact to be minimal. The Boston College study -- the basis for Christie’s $70 billion figure -- also listed family- and job-related reasons as the main factors chasing people from New Jersey. We rate Christie’s statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10457	"McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/28/democratic-national-committee/selectively-choosing-his-votes/	It would take a real hypocrite to announce that as president you would launch an initiative to end malaria when, as a senator, you repeatedly voted against malaria prevention efforts. That's the trap the Democratic National Committee said they caught Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain in last month after McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, announced his plan to eradicate malaria. In a news release dated March 26, the DNC claimed to fact-check McCain's malaria pledge by contrasting McCain's "rhetoric" with the "reality" that "McCain has voted repeatedly at least six times against funding for global HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB fund, once as one of only 14 senators." The release proceeds to list six instances between 2001 and 2003 in which McCain voted against bills or amendments that would have boosted funding for malaria prevention. An open and shut case of hypocrisy? Not quite, as it turns out. Indeed, McCain did vote against the bills cited by the DNC. But in each case, other factors cloud the issue and, in the end, McCain mostly supported less generous alternative measures favored by his party. In the 2001 vote cited by the DNC, for example, an amendment by Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold would have boosted funding for AIDS and malaria prevention in Africa but at the same time cut funding for Defense Department military procurement to pay for it. Many Democratic senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, also voted against it. In both of the 2002 votes cited, McCain voted against an emergency supplemental spending bill to combat terrorism on the grounds that it included too many provisions — malaria funding included — that had nothing to do with terrorism. In the second of those votes, McCain was one of only 14 senators to oppose a less generous GOP alternative. And in the case of the 2003 votes cited by the DNC, Republicans said they preferred alternative legislation for a number of reasons, arguing that Democratic amendments didn't include language to encourage donations from other countries, would have exceeded budget restrictions, and might overwhelm the bureaucracy with so much money that it wouldn't be able to disburse it wisely. With the exception of the 2001 vote and one of the 2002 votes, the remaining four votes split mostly along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the GOP concerns were outweighed by the magnitude of the AIDS crisis in Africa. In the end, compromises were reached on funding measures that were somewhat less generous, which McCain supported. As a result, the DNC's charge of hypocrisy is only Half True.

pomt-11124	Says Marsha Blackburn "voted against military pay raise."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/05/tennessee-democratic-party/tennessee-democrats-slam-blackburn-military-pay-vo/	When President Donald Trump went to Nashville to boost the Senate chances of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., he praised her for being a reliable soldier for the Republican agenda. "We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half," Trump said. But on one key vote, Blackburn broke with many of her Republican colleagues, and the Tennessee Democrats are chiding her for it. Blackburn was one of 90 Republicans to vote against a sweeping $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that funded agencies across the government. Inside its many pages was a 2.4 percent pay hike for the military. In an email to the media May 30, party spokesman Mark Brown had the subject line "Blackburn voted against military pay raise." The rest of the email was a copy and paste of an op-ed in the Tennessean from an Army veteran who criticized Blackburn for her vote. "This is a congresswoman that constantly touts her support for the military and veterans, so her vote against something that would improve our quality of life is both puzzling and troubling," the veteran wrote. We decided to give Blackburn’s voting record a closer look. The vote Blackburn made no secret that she opposed the spending bill. At the time of the vote, she released a statement decrying its impact on deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the appropriations bill would put the country deeper in debt by many billions of dollars. "Marsha has a record of supporting our military and veterans," campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler told us. "Congressman Blackburn voted against the bloated spending package — that included a smaller military pay raise than the one she supported (2.6 percent) — because of its reckless spending." As with any all-encompassing legislation, lawmakers will find some elements they support and others they oppose. Whichever way they vote, it is difficult to tie their decision to a specific section. Past votes In her 15 years in Congress, Blackburn has voted for appropriations bills that increased military pay at least four times, in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. The military pay hikes in those appropriations bills ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There are a number of authorization bills with pay increases that Blackburn has also supported. We counted 14 over the years, including the most recent one that passed in November 2017 with a 2.4 percent pay hike. Authorization bills don’t carry the same weight as appropriations measures, because they don’t actually give agencies the green light to spend money. Despite her opposition to the latest spending bill, Blackburn welcomed Trump’s support, and several of the victories he described at the rally, such as hikes in military spending, came out of the appropriations bill she voted against. And when the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel took to Twitter to praise Trump for the military pay raises, Blackburn’s campaign retweeted the message. Our ruling The Tennessee Democratic Party said that Blackburn voted against a military pay increase. Blackburn did vote no on a $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that increased pay for members of the armed forces by 2.4 percent. However, over many years, Blackburn has a consistent track record of voting in favor of pay raises for the military. To tie her recent vote to a single part of a massive spending measure leaves out a great deal of context. In this case, the legislation was estimated to add billions to annual deficits.

pomt-12747	Says Travis County’s sheriff refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373.	false	/texas/statements/2017/mar/01/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-falsely-says-travis-county-not-enforci/	Greg Abbott, who shut off about $1.5 million in grants to Travis County out of concern that the county’s Democratic officials unduly shield unauthorized immigrants, subsequently accused the local sheriff of breaking a federal law. The Republican governor said in a Feb. 6, 2017, tweet: "Sheriff violates oath by refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 & not giving ICE info about drugs cartels & armed robbers." ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that focuses on battling the illegal movement of people and trade. Abbott didn’t offer factual back-up for his charge. Separately, Wes Priddy of the sheriff’s department told us by phone there’s been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. "I don’t know where the governor is getting his information or his point of view. I suspect it’s just conjecture," Priddy said. Let’s recap the federal provisions singled out by Abbott before getting to the policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez and whether she’s not enforcing the law. Federal law Abbott did not single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing "detainer" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates so agents can consider them for deportation. Instead, the governor’s tweet refers to a 216-word law that’s focused on easing the flow of information between federal immigration authorities and local law agencies. Titled "Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service," the 1990s law bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities "information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual." Also, the law bars any person or agency from restricting another government entity from sending, requesting, receiving or maintaining information about any individual’s immigration status or exchanging such information with a government entity. Travis County policy We don’t know why Abbott concluded Hernandez isn’t enforcing those provisions. He didn’t say and an aide, Matt Hirsch, didn’t reply to our inquiry. But Abbott posted his tweet about three hours after a commentary piece by Hernandez was posted by the Austin American-Statesman. In the commentary, Hernandez, a Democrat elected sheriff in November 2016, defended her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours—with the exception of inmates charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Other inmates, she said, would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez wrote: "Our policies at the Travis County sheriff’s office are centered on all legal statutes and principles that are applicable to all. We proudly stand by our Constitution and our laws and plan to continue doing so. We will also continue to legally comply with" ICE, she wrote. A few days later, Hernandez posted a statement on the office’s website saying in part: "I am following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated." Travis County official We asked Priddy, who oversees the county’s correctional complex, if the new policy restricts the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott. Priddy told us there’s been no change in the flow of each inmate’s vital information to other law enforcement agencies including ICE. That is, Priddy said, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted and that information along with the person’s name and date of birth is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then, he said, to federal agencies including ICE, whose officers can then determine if a suspect merits their attention. According to the DPS, its Automated Fingerprint Information System stores the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals. Also, Priddy said, ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation. "If so, we share and allow," Priddy said, though he said ICE officers don’t have unfettered access to inmates in the jail’s intake area, which they once did. "We are complying" with 8 USC 1373, Priddy said, adding: "We are allowing ICE the opportunity to interview inmates; we are providing them information on their requests, just as we are with any other agency." We noticed, though, the sheriff’s policy includes a provision that seemingly could fetter information flow. It states that sheriff’s office "officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate’s release date or address to ICE." Asked about that, Priddy said by email: "The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone’s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency’s request." ICE focuses on detainers Next, we asked an ICE spokeswoman, Nina Pruneda, to evaluate Abbott’s claim. Prunedo, by email, sent an agency statement that didn’t touch on any law explicitly: "ICE would welcome any changes to current policy that would allow local authorities to more fully cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs," ICE said. "When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission," ICE said. Immigration experts We also asked immigration experts from different vantage points about the accuracy of Abbott’s claim. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggested the sheriff’s policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person’s release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. By email, Vaughan pointed out a 2016 Justice Department memo that led us to an explanation of 8 USC 1373 by the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee. That 1996 explanation says the panel’s intent was to "give state and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts and activities of illegal aliens." (After 9/11, Congress dissolved the Immigration and Naturalization Service with ICE assuming some of its duties.) "This section," the committee said, "is designed to prevent any state or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision or decision of any federal or state court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between state and local officials and the INS." We also heard back from Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which has as its mission working with and educating immigrants, community organizations and the legal sector to continue to build a democratic society that values diversity and the rights of all people. Generally, Graber commented by email, the sheriff’s policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn’t extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with the law highlighted by Abbott, she said. Sheriff revised policy Graber also underscored a section of the sheriff’s policy that wasn’t initially there, we noticed. The added section, point No. 10 in the policy, tracks with 8 USC 1373, stating: "This policy in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual’s immigration or citizenship status, and nothing in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or restrict TCSO personnel from exchanging information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of any individual with ICE." We asked the sheriff’s office why the section was added. By email, spokeswoman Kristen Dark replied that the provision was added Jan. 31, 2017 "in the interest of clarity." Simultaneously, Dark wrote, another part of the policy was expanded, in part with: "Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts’ website." Those sentences were inserted in front of an existing declaration about department personnel not using resources to help enforce federal immigration laws. Our ruling Abbott said Sheriff Hernandez refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373. Given the sheriff’s policy against automatically granting federal requests to detain immigrant-inmates or using personnel to enforce immigration laws, we can see how someone might speculate about the sheriff not enforcing, or complying with, the cited law about easing the flow of information about immigration or citizenship statuses. But Abbott didn't back up his claim, which also wasn’t explicitly borne out by ICE. Notably too, the sheriff's policy was expanded before Abbott leveled his claim to specify that it shouldn't be read as slowing or stopping any information flow between office personnel and ICE regarding the legal status of individuals. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-12737	Says White House adviser Steve Bannon said, "Nobody can blame you for beating your wife if it’s out of love."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/02/blog-posting/trump-adviser-steve-bannon-did-not-say-its-ok-beat/	Like a virus, an old fake news story that claims White House adviser Steve Bannon is an advocate of domestic abuse has made the leap from one site full of contrived articles to another. A Nov. 14, 2016, post on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) starts with a headline that reads, "Stephen Bannon: ‘Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love’." It was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of its crusade to winnow fake news from users’ social media feeds. The story has been popular on Facebook, which notes the USPOLN.com story link has been shared more than 58,000 times in the past four months. The story, which is not real, makes up quotes about Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News who became White House chief strategist for President Donald Trump. The post includes a reference to real charges Bannon faced in 1996, when his then-wife Mary Louise Piccard accused him of domestic abuse. Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness. Those charges were dropped in August 1996 when Piccard did not appear in court. The couple divorced in 1997. The post cites a Politico interview (which is fake), quoting Bannon as saying that marriage is great because "you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship." The quote isn’t worded the same way as the headline. "And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love," Bannon is quoted as saying. "As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties." Again, Bannon did not say these things. They’re made up. USPOLN.com, which we’ve written about before, identifies itself as "a US Political News and hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The domain is registered to an address in Kosovo. The site didn’t respond to our attempts to contact them via email. But the story actually comes from yet another joke site, in an Aug. 26, 2016, post on Politicops.com. That site is related to the site Newslo.com, which refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The same story also appears on other sites in the Newslo family, like Politicalo.com and Politicot.com. The articles were posted the day after stories recounting Bannon’s 1996 ran in outlets like Politico and the New York Times. Newslo.com stories take a small bite of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. The Bannon story originated on a site known for generating fake stories. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-04985	Says Jim Frishe wanted to "tax us for doing our taxes" through an accountant.	true	/florida/statements/2012/jul/20/accountability-government/attack-ad-says-jim-frishe-raised-taxes-accountants/	St. Petersburg Rep. Jim Frishe got his start in the Florida House in the 1980s, when the Republican served six years and took a vote to raise taxes. The widely unpopular "services tax" of 1987 was repealed months later amid a public uproar. But a group supporting his GOP opponent in the Senate District 22 primary isn’t letting Frishe, or voters, forget that initial vote. A television commercial riffs Frishe’s own slogan -- "This Republican has walked the walk for over 40 years" -- by saying he’s trampled voters with new taxes. Man: "Jim Frishe says he’s walked the walk in politics for 40 years. The truth is, he’s walked all over us with taxes." Woman: "Yeah, Frishe voted to raise our taxes on everything from dry-cleaning to pest control. Forty years is enough." Second woman: "Frishe voted to increase fees on car tags and fishing permits." Second man: "Frishe even wanted to tax accountants." Third woman: "You mean he wants to tax us for doing our taxes?" Third man: "Forty years of this is enough." Fourth woman: "More than enough." The ad is sponsored by Accountability in Government, an electioneering group that supports St. Petersburg Republican Rep. Jeff Brandes for the seat. We tried to contact the group’s chairman but did not hear back. The group sponsors a website, 40yearsisenough.com, that contains a lengthy document of news clips summarizing the tax controversy and newspaper editorials against Frishe. (As an aside, we want to first address the "Forty years is enough" rhetoric. It’s taken from Frishe’s own ads, where he talks about being active within the Republican Party and for Ronald Reagan. To be clear, he has served six terms in the Legislature. Six years from 1984 to 1990, and six more from 2006-2012.) Of all the tax claims, we were most intrigued by the exchange about taxing accountant services. Did Frishe really want to "tax us for doing our taxes?" The tone of the ad might suggest the taxes Frishe supported stuck. The truth is, some did and some didn’t, and some votes referenced in the ad happened more than 20 years apart. This vote on taxing accountant services, among many other services, happened 25 years ago. Tampa Republican Bob Martinez was governor and Democrats controlled the Legislature. Frishe was in the Republican minority. There was a push that year to broaden the state’s tax base, Frishe explained. There was no recession that year; rather, Florida’s economy was booming. Still, the state needed money to fix roads and pay for an influx of new public school students. To do that, the Legislature passed a 5 percent sales tax on many personal and professional services, including accountants’ fees, agricultural services, house-building, architect and engineering fees, pest control, cleaning services, computer and data processing, advertising, legal fees, magazine and newspaper subscriptions and newspaper rack sales, pet-grooming and cleaning services. The April vote on SB 777 was 83-31, with some Pinellas County Republicans, including Frishe, former Rep. and Sen. Dennis Jones, and current lobbyist Pete Dunbar, joining the Democrats to pass it despite the objections of many conservatives. Lawmakers said it was the biggest tax increase in state history and expected it to raise $761.1 million for the state in its first year and $1.2 billion the year after that. Martinez swiftly signed it into law. "There is no joy and glee in taxation, but there is a sense that this House and this Senate have taken the first step forward for protecting Florida's future," said House Speaker Jon Mills, D-Gainesville, according to a Tampa Bay Times account (then the St. Petersburg Times). Someone had to be the "adult in the room," Frishe said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, taking a jab against Brandes, 36, whom Frishe indirectly mocks in another commercial as "a young wannabe politician, beating his chest, claiming to be a Reagan Republican." A lobbying fight to repeal the tax emerged that summer, with the Florida Association of Broadcasters railing against it loudly. Martinez summoned lawmakers for a special session on the issue, and lawmakers repealed the services sales tax on Dec. 10, 1987, and replaced it with a one percent increase on the state sales tax on goods. Frishe voted against the measure. In the House Journal, which is an official record of the proceedings, Frishe explained his vote by saying that he supported repealing the tax on services, but he opposed raising the sales tax on goods. "I favor repealing the sales tax on services as it passed in the 1987 Regular Session," Frishe wrote. "I have voted 'No' on CS/CS/SB 5-D and CS/SB 6-D because it raises the state sales tax from 5 cents to 6 cents. This merely continues to raise the needed revenue for our state from the same shrinking base and remains as regressive as it was at 5 cents. Florida has serious needs, but to continue 'business as usual' will not solve the long term needs of this state." Would Florida’s economy be in a stronger place if the tax had remained? "I think it unquestionably would," Frishe told PolitiFact Florida. We asked Brandes for his thoughts, even though he did not sponsor the ad. "I think the question is, is it a fact that Jim Frishe voted to raise taxes?" Brandes said. "Not that he later changed his mind. And I think clearly it’s a fact that he did." Our ruling A third-party group says Frishe voted to tax people for "doing our taxes." In 1987, Frishe did vote for a plan to tax services in the state of Florida, including accountants' fees. He later said he favored a proposal to repeal the services tax, but he could not support the repeal in the Legislature becuase it included a provision that raised the sales tax on goods. While those caveats give a fuller picture of Frishe's position and his vote, they do not undermine the statement made by the group Accountability in Government. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14872	"Over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/12/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-over-half-black-workers-earn-l/	During an all-candidates’ Democratic forum in Rock Hill, S.C., on Nov. 6, 2015, host Rachel Maddow of MSNBC asked Bernie Sanders how he could win the support of African-American voters, a crucial Democratic voting group in the early primary state of South Carolina. Maddow noted that Sanders was polling at 8 percent in a recent poll in South Carolina and asked if he would be able to convince African-American voters that he could press for their issues. Sanders responded in part by citing his economic platform, which he said would positively impact African-Americans. "I have the economic and social justice agenda now that, once we get the word out, will, in fact, resonate with the African-American community," Sanders said. "We're talking about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. … Over half of the black workers in this country earn less." We wondered whether Sanders was right that "over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour. So we took a closer look. We turned to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which, among other things, tracks the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by race. The bureau’s data for the third quarter of 2015 shows that the median weekly earnings for African-American workers was $624. If you divide that by the standard 40 hours in a workweek, it works out to $15.60 per hour. That means that half of African-American workers earned less than $15.60. So Sanders was close on this but exaggerated slightly. His claim is off by a little more than 4 percent. When we asked Sanders’ campaign for their source, they pointed us to a report issued earlier this month from the National Employment Law Project that found that 54.1 percent of African-American workers earned less than $15.00 an hour. The group calculated that figure using data from 2012 through 2014. That’s a reasonable measurement, but while our figure covers a briefer period of time, it’s also more current, reflecting the continued economic growth since the end of 2014. Our ruling Sanders said that "over half of the black workers in this country earn less" than $15 an hour. Depending on the time frame used, the data shows that roughly half of black workers earn less than $15. The most recent data shows that half earn less than $15.60, which is a little higher than what Sanders said, but his number is not far off. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02240	"Georgia has the nation's fifth largest Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition program, serving more than 270,000 mothers, babies and children every day."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/15/georgia-department-public-health/georgias-wic-program-ranked-7th-largest/	One government program putting food on the table for the needy is the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program, most often known by the acronym WIC. The program targets low-income, nutritionally at-risk groups -- mostly pregnant women, new moms, babies and children up to age 5. Participants receive vouchers to buy qualifying healthy foods -- such as fruit, vegetables, peanut butter and milk. (No lobster allowed under WIC, unlike the food stamp program. See food stamps Politifact, March 21.) As its name suggests, the WIC program, which is 100 percent federally funded, is meant to supplement what’s already in the pantry. The average WIC participant received $45.47 worth of groceries a month in 2013, probably not enough on its own to keep body and soul together. During the recent General Assembly session, when GOP lawmakers were pushing through a bill to require drug tests of some food stamp recipients, a reader asked for a fact check on WIC. He jogged our memory last week after seeing a blog from the state Department of Public Health, the agency that administers the program. The post stated: "Georgia has the nation's fifth largest Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition program, serving more than 270,000 mothers, babies and children every day." "Could this be true?" the reader asked. "Dare I ask what that’s costing us?" We reached out to Nancy Nydam, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health. Based on costs, Georgia’s program ranked fifth among the 50 states, the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia for four years, from 2009 to 2012, Nydam said. But that’s no longer the case. New data show that the Georgia program dropped to seventh in the rankings for 2013, she said. (The blogger was going on 2013 projections, not actual data for the year, Nydam said.) The new data, provided by the Department of Public Health, show that, for 2013, Georgia ranked seventh behind: California, $1,095,910,535; Texas, $482,192,108; New York, $445,559,283; Florida, $354,990,320; Puerto Rico, $242,747,993; and Illinois, $215,142,474. Georgia spent about $215.1 million for food and other services for 289,527 WIC recipients, including nutrition and breast-feeding education, and referrals for health and social services, Nydam said. Enrollment in the program was down 14,340 from 2012. It peaked in 2009, as the economy was crumbling, at 323,353, state data show. Costs for the Georgia program fell by more than $59 million, from $274.5 million in 2012, due to a couple of factors, Nydam said. Besides having fewer women and children on the rolls, Georgia has been working with manufacturers to lower the program’s costs for food. As a result, state spending on food for program participants was reduced from $225 million in 2011 to $204 million in 2012 and to $157 million for 2013, state data show. The feds also have pushed states to do more to combat fraud. After it became a stand-alone agency, the Department of Public Health created an inspector general’s office to investigate fraud in the WIC program and developed and issued new WIC vouchers, complete with a foil seal and watermark designed to deter counterfeiting, Nydam said. The inspector general’s office has prosecuted 16 people for WIC vendor fraud, terminated 183 vendors and recouped $17 million as restitution. Our conclusion: The blog statement said Georgia ranks fifth among the states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories based on the cost of its WIC program. That was true for four years, through 2012. Once Politifact inquired, state officials said there was new data showing the state dropped to seventh for 2013. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-13906	"Despite the rhetoric from Democrat politicians, more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-right-there-are-more-people-working-e/	Jobs have been a constant theme for Gov. Scott Walker -- and a persistent point of attack from his opponents. In the run-up to the state Democratic Party convention, Gov. Scott Walker issued a string of 10 claims about the state’s economy on Facebook and Twitter. The first one caught our attention. "FACT CHECK: Despite the rhetoric from Democrat politicians, more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin," Walker tweeted June 3, 2016. We’re in the fact-checking business, of course. And we closely followed Walker’s 2010 campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. In the end, the number totaled 146,795. We rated it Promise Broken. So, is employment really at an all-time high? Looking at the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and its Local Area Unemployment Statistics report, the gold standard for statewide employment data. We looked at employment numbers going back to the 1930s. The agency counts someone as employed if during the week examined they did any work as a paid employee, work for their own business or farm, or worked 15 or more hours unpaid for an enterprise operated by a family member. People who had a job but were not working because of vacations, illness or other reasons are counted as employed. In March of 2016, the most recent date for which figures are available, more than 3 million people were employed -- the highest ever. Previously, the employment number peaked in 2008 at around 2.9 million. We wondered how many other states could make the same claim. Of the 12 states in the Midwest, six others are also at their highest number of employed persons, for seven in all. (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska.) Some of that can be attributed to population growth. In 2015, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated Wisconsin’s population at 5.7 million, up from 5.6 million in the 2010 census and up from 5.3 million in 2000. During the last 10 years, Wisconsin’s population grew 3.7 percent, while over the same period employment grew 2.4 percent. In the last five years, population grew 1.1 percent and employment increased 6.3 percent. "Population growth plays a role in driving employment higher, which is why many economists like looking at things like the unemployment rate as a measure of the health of the labor market," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management. As of March, the state’s unemployment rate sat at 4.5 percent, down from recession highs of over 9 percent. The unemployment rate itself is an imperfect measure. The rate does not include people who have dropped out of the labor force and stopped looking for work, nor does it consider job quality -- that is people who are considered "underemployed." By that measure, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, employment was down in the 3 percent range. Our rating Walker said "more people are employed this year than at any point in the history of Wisconsin." Employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point, but the picture is more complex than he suggests and economists generally prefer a different measure -- the unemployment rate -- that accounts for population growth over time.

In 1997, he was the lone "nay" vote against a bill called the Volunteer Protection Act, which exempted Good Samaritans from being sued. In 2000, he was the only senator who voted against a resolution "encouraging local schools to insist on zero-tolerance policies towards violence and illegal drug use." In 2001, he offered the only "nay" on an amendment to the No Child Left Behind Act that shielded teachers from civil liability. "I don't think the federal government ought to be federalizing something that's been under the state purview for 200 years," Thompson told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, Sept. 7, 2007. "Give me a good reason why, when the federal government... can't get its own act together, why it ought to be taking on these other things in order to get a press release and a headline? ... That's not the right thing to do." But he wasn't perfect. As a senator from 1994 to 2003, Thompson did divert from his federalist philosophy in at least one big way: supporting President Bush's No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which sets federal standards for local schools.

pomt-14435	When John Kasich became governor of Ohio, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/mar/08/arnold-schwarzenegger/arnold-schwarzeneggers-claim-about-ohios-financial/	Hoping to add some political muscle to Republican John Kasich’s bid for the White House, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the Ohio governor for president during a rally in Columbus this week. But did Schwarzenegger, a fellow Republican, bend the truth when he described Ohio’s financial turnaround under Kasich? In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger called Kasich an "action hero," saying that when Kasich became governor in 2011, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus." We decided to check that claim. Kasich has made similar statements throughout his campaign for president, and highlighted this fiscal transformation on his website. "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus," Kasich said during the Republican presidential debate in Cleveland last year. The national PolitiFact team took a deeper look at Kasich’s claim last August. It’s very similar to Schwarzenegger’s claim. Here’s what it found: An $8 billion hole? There’s an argument for $8 billion, but there’s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich’s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with "conceptually" in a 2011 interview, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this as a "hole" rather than a deficit. Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. Schwarzenegger used the term "deficit," which we interpreted as a minor misstatement rather than an attempt to deceive. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state’s "rainy day fund" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. The surplus remained above $2 billion this week, said a spokesman for the budget office. Does Kasich deserve credit? It’s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state’s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state’s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. Schwarzenegger’s claim strongly implies Kasich played a central role in the turnaround, though it doesn’t explicitly link the two together. But it’s important to remember that Kasich took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio’s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. As of December, the national unemployment rate was 5 percent and the rate in Ohio was 4.8 percent. So Kasich’s timing has been fortunate. Our ruling In his endorsement speech, Schwarzenegger said that when Kasich became governor, "there was an $8 billion budget deficit and now there’s a $2 billion surplus." Kasich said, "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus." It’s possible to argue over whether the starting point should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich and Schwarzenegger didn’t pull that figure out of thin air, though it certainly was high by historical standards. Kasich also used the term "hole," which is more appropriate than "deficit." Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it’s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that "I" did it, since the state’s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.	None	Arnold Schwarzenegger	None	None	None	2016-03-08T15:00:33	2016-03-06	['Ohio', 'John_Kasich']
pomt-13896	"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/28/donald-trump/checking-donald-trump-hillary-clintons-role-growin/	Donald Trump blames Hillary Clinton for the United States getting beaten by China on trade. "Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs," he tweeted on June 21, 2016. He said something similar during a speech the following day -- that "our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Hillary Clinton’s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned." To analyze Trump’s assertion, we looked at two key questions. First, did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during President Barack Obama’s first term -- the period when Clinton was serving as secretary of state? And second, given how directly Trump blamed Clinton, how much responsibility does she have for the rising trade deficit? We found that Trump’s 40-percent figure is somewhat valid, though it depends on when you start the clock running. Where he goes wrong is saying that it’s Clinton’s fault. Did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during Obama’s first term? The trade deficit with China did go up during Obama’s first term, and one can argue that the increase was as high as 40 percent. Here are recent statistics for the trade deficit with China as compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: The rise between 2008, the last year before Obama took office, and 2012, the final year of his first term, amounted to 18.4 percent, which is less than half as big as Trump said. Looking instead at the period 2009 through 2013 does produce a 40 percent increase, however, and that’s in line with what Trump said. It’s worth noting that this time frame uses 2009 as the baseline year. That was the worst point of the recession, which means that the baseline that year was artificially low. Incidentally, the evidence for the loss of "millions of jobs" is somewhat mixed. The strongest support comes from an Economic Policy Institute study that found that between 2001 and 2013, the trade deficit with China "eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs," of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. But it’s worth noting that the Economic Policy Institute is a think tank with backing from labor unions, which are often skeptical of free-trade policies. Other analysts who take a more free-market orientation, such as the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argue that the connection between trade deficits and job losses is much less direct than the Economic Policy Institute study suggests. All told, Trump’s 40 percent figure is credible, though it’s important to note that the number is somewhat cherry-picked. How much responsibility does Clinton have for the rising trade deficit? The support for this part of Trump’s tweet is weaker. First off, the State Department has a voice in trade policy, but it is not the most important one. "The secretary of state is only slightly involved with trade policy," said Joel P. Trachtman, a professor of international law at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. "Trade policy is set at the presidential level, and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office otherwise has the greatest role in negotiations and agenda setting. So, among U.S. government officials, the secretary of state has a minor effect." Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agreed. "The secretary of state has little if any influence over trade deficits," he said. But what if Trump was saying that Clinton was part of the Obama administration, and that Obama is to blame for China’s growing trade deficit? That’s not the case, either. For starters, the trend lines go back long before Obama took office. "The United States has been running a trade deficit since 1996, with the big drop coming after the bursting of the ‘tech bubble’ in 2001 under George W. Bush," said Timothy J. Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. The statement, he said, "is extremely misleading." Indeed, broader economic forces -- more so than an administration’s policy decisions -- tend to determine the size of trade deficits, experts said. "Trade deficits are the product of three macro forces over which the secretary of state has no control -- the trade-weighted dollar exchange rate; the state of the world economy outside the United States; and the state of the U.S. economy," Hufbauer said. Other trends also complicate an easy assignment of "blame" for trade deficits with China, experts added. Martin Baily, a Brookings Institution economist, previously told us that some manufacturing job losses stem from trade, but not all. "Part of what has happened is that there has been consolidation in the industry to take advantage of larger scale production," Baily said. "Manufacturing is changing because of technology and trade, and that inevitably will lead to plant closures." Alternately, economists Robert Z. Lawrence and Lawrence Edwards have written in the Harvard Business Review that a lack of demand led to manufacturing job losses. American factories grew to be too efficient, and therefore needed fewer workers to meet the needs of consumers, they argued. Finally, as we saw earlier with the data quirks around 2009, the Great Recession likely played a role in how the deficit grew during Obama’s first term. "This economic expansion would be expected to expand imports more than exports would expand, and thus the trade deficit would be expected to widen, holding other things constant," Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. "This surely is the overwhelming reason for any expansion of the the U.S.-China trade deficit during this period." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs." Trump is largely accurate about the 40 percent bump, though that number is somewhat cherry-picked, and he has a point that some -- though not all -- estimates suggest that trade with China has resulted in millions of job losses. However, Trump’s strong words of blame for Clinton overplays the role she had in this process. Not only do other administration players have a bigger role in setting trade policy, but the growth in the trade deficit predates the Obama administration and has a lot to do with factors that any administration would have little control over.

pomt-12918	"Social Security is in trouble (it’s going bankrupt by 2034)."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/jan/17/sam-johnson/sam-johnson-airs-half-true-claim-social-security-g/	A Texas congressman forecasted disaster within two decades unless Congress adopts a fix to the Social Security program. U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, declared in a Dec. 10, 2016, online post: "Social Security is in trouble (it’s going bankrupt by 2034)." Johnson, a former Texas House member and POW who also has announced plans not to seek re-election in 2018, included with his Facebook post a web link to a Forbes magazine news article about his freshly-introduced plan for Social Security reform. That plan, he wrote in his post, would prevent benefits from being "immediately cut" by 20 percent when the Social Security fund runs dry. Johnson’s 54-page proposal would change how benefits are calculated, lowering benefits for high-income workers and increasing them for low-income workers, and also raise the age at which workers could claim Social Security retirement benefits from the existing 66 to 69. Social Security in the federal budget Social Security, established by a 1935 law, adds up to the nation’s universal support program for retired, disabled or dependent Americans. In 2015, too, it accounted for the largest single chunk of federal spending, racking up $882 billion in expenses that year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office, "The Federal Budget in 2015" And it’s no secret that barring intervention, the program is headed for shrinkage. In May 2013, PolitiFact Ohio rated Half True a claim that "the Social Security trust fund is sound," finding credible forecasts of the program’s fiscal fade; the CBO in 2012 said the fund would run dry by 2034 under current law. Millions of Americans also consider Social Security vital income. In 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True a claim that one third of the country’s seniors were depending on Social Security for 90 percent of their income; both figures were actually greater. As of November 2016, some 66 million Americans received Social Security payments, which averaged $1,241.66 monthly, according to the Social Security Administration. About 41 million beneficiaries were older than age 65 and about 25 million of those individuals relied on the aid for half or more of their monthly incomes. So, was Johnson correct that the program will be bankrupt by 2034? Johnson cites trustees' report We emailed Johnson’s Washington office and got a reply from his press secretary, Adrienne Rimmer, who sent a 272-page report from the board of trustees of the Social Security program. The report, dated June 22, 2016, made projections for the future of Social Security, which is formally called the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (OASDI) reflecting the combination of two insurance programs: old age and survivors insurance and then disability insurance. Rimmer pointed us to language in the report stating: "Under the Trustees’ intermediate assumptions, projected OASDI costs will exceed total income by increasing amounts starting in 2020, and the dollar level of the combined trust fund reserves declines until reserves become depleted in 2034." Depleted? That sounds like nearly emptied as in almost bankrupt. Still, the trustees predicted there would remain money sufficient to pay reduced benefits. The report states: "At the time of depletion of these combined reserves, continuing income to the combined trust funds would be sufficient to pay 79 percent of scheduled benefits." The cause for projected depletion of the funds, according to the report, is "the retirement of the baby boom generation will increase the number of beneficiaries much faster than the number of covered workers increases." To refresh: The baby boom generation was born in about the two decades following WWII, a period when the U.S. birth rate surged nearly 50 percent over pre-war levels, according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control. The birth rate then tapered from about 26.5 births per 1,000 Americans in 1948 to about 14 in 2009. That cohort born in the post-war decades began to retire, and thus began to draw retirement benefits, after 2010. As more baby boomers retire, they will switch from a source of income for social security to an expense. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2014 that the number of Americans age 65 and older would grow from 22 per every 100 working-age people in 2012 to 35 per every 100 working-age people in 2030. That’s why the trustees, in their report, predicted that total program costs will begin to exceed income in 2020, with all cash reserves expended by 2034. So we could see how Johnson reached his conclusion. Bankrupt or not? And does the trustees’ forecast break out to Social Security going bankrupt? We noticed, for starters, that the trustees’ analysis, slated for its next update in July 2017, indicates there’s a minimal possibility the fund doesn’t dry up until at least 2091. But otherwise the latest report presents three scenarios, of "low," "intermediate" and "high" costs to the program, based on assumptions about birth and death rates, growth in wages, interest rates and the consumer price index. For the low-cost scenario, the report states, the board assumed a relatively high birth rate, a relatively high death rate and relatively high immigration--meaning many people entering the workforce and fewer retirees living long enough to collect substantial benefits. The low-cost scenario also assumes relatively high worker productivity and wage growth plus relatively high inflation and low unemployment--all of this adding up to workers drawing bigger paychecks and paying more into Social Security. The high-cost scenario, in contrast, assumes low birth and death rates and low immigration, all of this placing more stress on the fund. SOURCE: Document, "The 2016 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors insurance and federal disability insurance trust funds," Board of Trustees, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance trust funds, June 22, 2016 Johnson’s conclusions were based on the intermediate scenario -- though the report said "significant uncertainty surrounds the intermediate assumptions." Then again, when the report authors ran 5,000 simulations with randomly assigned values to the key parameters, they found a 95 percent chance that the fund would dry up between 2029 and 2045, leaving benefits to be paid solely from incoming payroll tax receipts. News reports don't say 'bankrupt' Seeking non-governmental context, we looked up news articles from the time of the trustees’ report’s release. Up front, we noticed, none of the stories on the trustees' forecast includes the word "bankrupt," The Wall Street Journal reported on June 22, 2016: "Social Security, Medicare face insolvency over 20 years, trustees report." The article said: "Social Security faces depletion by 2034." Around the same date, Time magazine reported that "the combined trust funds that help pay old age and disability benefits are likely to run out by 2034," and The Washington Post wrote, "the Social Security trust fund has enough cash to pay full benefits for another 18 years." Outside experts concur it's not bankruptcy For more perspective, we queried several outside experts including Mike Brandl, a senior lecturer in economics at The Ohio State University. So, Social Security going bankrupt? "It’s kind of a scare tactic to use that kind of terminology," Brandl said by phone. "There is a legal definition of bankruptcy. When a firm or a person goes bankrupt, what happens generally is the creditors puts in a claim with the courts to recover their debt." According to the website for U.S. federal courts,"bankruptcy helps people who can no longer pay their debts get a fresh start by liquidating assets to pay their debts or by creating a repayment plan." A business can can either liquidate or reorganize in order to claim bankruptcy. In contrast, under the scenario outlined in the trustees’ report, the Social Security program wouldn’t liquidate assets or be reorganized after 2034; it would simply shrink what is pays in benefits. That is, Brandl told us, Social Security would "become insolvent," meaning it wouldn’t be able to pay its debts in full. We ran Brandl's analysis past Josh Gordon, policy director of the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, which sponsors research and education about the federal budget. Gordon agreed by phone: "Bankrupt is the wrong word to use. Bankruptcy implies it runs out of money, it doesn’t exist, it has to liquidate its assets, and nothing of the sort could happen to the Social Security program." We also connected with Thomas Saving, a Social Security trustee from 2000 through 2007 and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University. Saving said by phone that regardless of bankruptcy’s definition, the trustees’ report made clear that Social Security will not be able to pay its bills in full after 2034 without a change in law. Savings added that in his view, a change in law was "certain" to be adopted by Congress because "it’s impossible to imagine that you make all these promises and you’re going to renege on them." Promises? Saving noted that working Americans pay into Social Security with the understanding that they will eventually draw benefits. So, Saving suggested, lawmakers couldn’t conceivably let the program die. Saving later emailed us a web link to a Social Security Administration web page listing nine categories of likely social security reforms intended to maintain solvency. They range from raising the cap on a federal cap on taxable income, to taxation of benefits and investments, raising the age at which a person automatically qualifies for retirement benefits, creating personal Social Security accounts or changing the rules by which children or spouses of workers receive benefits. Our ruling Johnson said the Social Security program "is going bankrupt by 2034." Johnson's cited government scenario indicates a mismatch between Social Security revenues and obligations will likely result in shortfalls and benefit cuts by 2034. But the relevant report also says the scenario's underlying assumptions come with "significant uncertainty." Regardless, it's clear that at some future date Social Security will have to rely solely on incoming payroll tax receipts to cover what would likely be reduced benefits. That’s trouble, as Johnson said. Yet it’s not bankruptcy, which suggests a terminal shutdown. We rate this claim Half True.

Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices. Sanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis. "Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard," Sanders said. "As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse." That claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis? Sanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers. "According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs," it reads. The report refers to Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006. A 2014 Pew report more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That’s a loss of 43 percent. Of course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed "took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites." Here’s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this: Census Bureau data corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth. Our ruling Sanders said, "The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse." Estimates for how much wealth blacks lost from 2005 to 2009 — as a result of the housing bubble — range from 53 percent to 61 percent. African-American net worth plummeted 43 percent from 2007 to 2013 — as a result of the financial crisis. Because the two financial crises are inseparable, we won’t quibble with Sanders’ timeline. We rate his claim True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-11T22:54:40	2016-02-11	['None']
pomt-08061	"The Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his [transportation] plan."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/24/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-says-gov-mcdonnell-didnt-consul/	The chairman of Virginia’s Republican Party recently sent a letter to all the state’s Democrat legislators soliciting ideas for how to address state road needs. "If for some reason you feel uncomfortable reaching out to the Governor, just drop by our Headquarters on Grace Street," Pat Mullins wrote. "You don't even have to come in the front door. We're putting a drop box in the atrium. Just open the door, and drop your plan. Any format you like." Mullins even offered to carry each idea to the Governor’s office himself. The missive was not well-received by a number of Democrats, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong among them. On Monday, Armstrong fired a response saying Mullins’ letter "reveals a certain desperation by the Republican Party of Virginia." He also took aim at the Governor’s recently released $4 billion transportation plan. "On Monday we learned that the Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan to borrow $3 billion and take another $1 billion out of the general fund to pay for transportation," Armstrong wrote. "Despite your entreaties, that revelation makes it difficult to believe that the Governor is inclined to listen to the Democrats if he didn’t even run this plan by the Republican majority in the House of Delegates before sending it out." It would seem remarkable if the Governor hadn’t consulted with fellow Republicans before trotting out the plan, so we thought we’d look into that. Asked for a source, Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, pointed us to a Washington Post blog. It reported unnamed legislators were miffed that House and Senate Republican legislative caucuses were not briefed prior to the announcement of the plan. Is briefing the caucuses common protocol before making such an announcement? "It’s a best practice, but not as commonly done as one might assume," said Bill Leighty, who was chief of staff to former Govs. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine. It’s accurate the governor did not collectively brief the 78 lawmakers who belong to either the House or Senate Republican caucus. Armstrong seemed to take it one step further by saying the governor "did not consult members of his own party" before releasing the plan. McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin said Armstrong is wrong. "The governor’s transportation proposals were all derived from transportation work groups that included Republican lawmakers," he said. "Every proposal was discussed. Further, the governor and staff are in constant communication with Republican leaders in both houses regarding all policy proposals made by this office." We talked to talk to a few Republicans to make sure. Del. Glenn Oder, R-Newport News, said he helped shape and vet the proposal as part of a 12-person transportation work group that included Republicans from the House and Senate as well as the administration. Read the quote from Armstrong’s letter, Oder responded: "Who in the world would have told him that? He (Armstrong) didn’t call and ask me." Oder said everyone in the group was aware of everything in the governor’s announcement. "I can’t emphasize enough how extensive the discussions have been on these issues," he said. "To say that no one was aware just isn’t anywhere close to accurate." What about Republican leadership? "I don’t know where he gets that kind of stuff," said G. Paul Nardo, chief of staff to House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford. "There’s a lot of things you could probably criticize the administration for, but communication isn’t one of them." Nardo noted the Post blog didn’t name or quote any Republicans complaining that they weren’t consulted. "It’s just ridiculous. The speaker was involved with it in specific discussions early on and certainly kept abreast," he said, adding that Howell was made aware of the announcement days beforehand and knew "the broad contours" of the plan. "We didn’t see a press release beforehand or anything like that," Nardo said, noting that sending out a mass email to legislators in advance wouldn’t be prudent since specifics might leak. House Majority Whip Bill Janis, R-Henrico, echoed Nardo. "I am aware that the Governor directly or representatives of the Governor spoke to House leadership beforehand," Janis said. "The notion that they’re not making us aware of stuff beforehand is just flat out wrong," he said. "Whether we’re having detailed three-hour long meetings about each and every policy initiative they have...that’s just not a realistic expectation." Let’s recap. Armstrong wrote the "Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan." Clearly, not every Republican legislator was in the loop. While not every GOP legislator was in the loop, plenty were involved in shaping the plan and the Republican leadership says they were kept informed along the way. We find the claim False.

pomt-03234	"60 percent of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math. Only 26% have a teacher with a undergraduate major in math."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/16/george-p-bush/bush-claim-about-proficiency-texas-8th-graders-mat/	George P. Bush, a Fort Worth Republican running for Texas land commissioner in 2014, wrote on Twitter that "60 percent of Texas 8th graders are not proficient in math." Bush’s July 2, 2013, tweet continued: "Only 26% have a teacher with a undergraduate major in math." We were curious about both of his claims, but also wondered why a land commissioner hopeful would zero in on middle-school math. By email, Bush spokesman Trey Newton pointed out that the commissioner manages state lands, which generate school revenue. Also, he said, Bush is a former schoolteacher who has helped local charter schools. Texas eighth-graders ‘proficient’ in math? Per Bush’s Twitter post, Newton pointed us to Change the Equation, a non-partisan CEO-led initiative to mobilize businesses to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. An initiative web page presents "proficiency" results from the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress, which for nearly four decades has tested random samples of students around the country with results serving as a kind of national report card. In every state every two years, clutches of eighth graders are tested in math and reading. On the tests, significantly, a "proficient" score means a student has more than mastered the subject. A student attaining a lower score might qualify for what the government calls its "basic" rating. In 2011, the minimum score to be considered "proficient" on the eighth-grade math assessment was 299 on a scale of 0 to 500, according to a September 2010 U.S. Department of Education report spelling out testing details. Proficient students "should understand the connections among fractions, percents, decimals, and other mathematical topics such as algebra and functions," the report said. "Students at this level are expected to have a thorough understanding of" basic "arithmetic operations—an understanding sufficient for problem solving in practical situations." Students with scores of 262 met the "basic" threshold, according to the report, meaning they were able to solve problems using varied "strategies and technological tools—including calculators, computers, and geometric shapes. Students at this level also should be able to use fundamental algebraic and informal geometric concepts in problem solving." Unlike eighth graders scoring high enough to be "proficient," the "basic" students "show limited skill in communicating mathematically," the report said. Newton pointed us to another group’s web page indicating that in 2011, 60 percent of the Texas eighth-graders chosen to take the math assessment did not score well enough to be considered proficient, though that also was an improvement on previous years, according to the information posted by Kids Count, a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Some 64 percent of Texas eighth-graders were not proficient on the math assessment in 2009, Kids Count said, with 75 percent not proficient in 2003. By telephone, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson of the Texas Education Agency pointed us to a federal chart showing that on the 2011 math test, 81 percent of participating Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to meet or exceed the "basic" threshold--counting the 40 percent of students who were "proficient." On the 2009 test, 78 percent of Texas eighth-graders scored well enough to clear the "basic" hurdle, 36 percent of them proving "proficient." These results were far better than the first year shown, 1990, when 45 percent of tested Texas students achieved "basic" scores or better, including 13 percent deemed "proficient." Asked to explain the gains, Culbertson said, "Instruction has gotten better and teachers are better trained." Math teachers majoring in math And did most eighth-grade math teachers not major in math? Newton noted another Change the Equation web page including a bar graph indicating that in 2011, 26 percent of Texas eighth-grade math teachers had majored in math, compared with 31 percent of such teachers nationally. A footnote says these percentages did not count teachers who were "math education" majors. By telephone, spokesman Arnold Goldstein of the National Center for Education Statistics cautioned that the teachers surveyed do not amount to a random sample. The Texas math teachers who answered such background questions in 2011, he said, were simply those teachers who had the state’s 7,500 students in 210 schools randomly chosen to take the federal test. That wrinkle aside, does the research support Bush’s claim? Evidently. With Goldstein’s help, we downloaded NAEP survey results indicating that 21 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math test in 2011 had a math teacher who reported majoring in math. That compared with 26 percent in the government’s comparable 2009 survey, 28 percent in 2003 and 36 percent in 2000. And by email, a spokesman for a Washington, D.C.-based group, American Institutes for Research, told us that other 2011 NAEP survey data--information not immediately accessible to the public--indicates 26 percent of the students had a teacher who had majored in math or "another mathematics subject" such as statistics. Claus Von Zastrow further provided a spreadsheet showing the percentages for each state. Finally, Goldstein guided us to NAEP survey results indicating that in 2011, 16 percent of the Texas eighth-graders who took the math exam had a math teacher who had majored in math education. Past surveys indicated that in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, 10 percent to 18 percent of such eighth-graders had a math teacher who had majored in math education. For another perspective, we reached Cynthia Schneider of the Texas Council of Teachers of Mathematics, who said by telephone that her review of the 2011 eighth grade NAEP math test results for Texas showed no significant differences in the scores of students who had teachers who had majored in math versus teachers who had not. Regardless, Schneider said, it’s increasingly important for middle-school math teachers to have taken advanced math courses in college because more and more students are expected to absorb algebra and other complex math topics. "Math majors do matter," she said. Newton of Bush’s campaign suggested by email that it makes sense to stress teachers who majored in math, rather than math education. "There are differences in the overall design of these degree plans, including the number of upper-division mathematics courses taken and the level of advanced mathematics taken," Newton said. Newton stood by Bush’s emphasis on students whose scores met the "proficient" threshold, saying that’s an accepted benchmark. "If major education agencies are choosing to report it this way, choosing to report the proficient number rather than the basic, we are not being misleading by following suit," Newton said by email. Our ruling Bush said 60 percent of Texas eighth graders are not "proficient" in math and only 26 percent have a teacher who majored in math in college. Federal figures support both ends of this claim, though clarification is needed to specify that "proficient" here does not mean that 60 percent of such students are flat failing to keep up. In 2011, 19 percent of Texas eighth-graders fell short of the "basic" math achievement hurdle set for the federal math test. We rate this statement as Mostly True.	None	George P.

pomt-01057	"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-obama-2010-us-has-created-more-jobs-all-adva/	Positive economic indicators were a major piece of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, including a claim he repeated throughout 2014: that the American economy has outperformed the economies of other advanced countries. In talking about his goals for the upcoming year, Obama said, "As we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all advanced economies combined." We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that "we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." His numbers at the time were off, and it seemed like the other economies were ever so slightly edging out the United States for total jobs created. A few months later, we’re able to update this fact-check with more recent data. The new information actually lines up better with Obama’s claim. But there are still problems with the idea that people are being put back to work. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? For this fact-check, we’ll use International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as "advanced economies" and seven of those as "major advanced economies." We looked at total average annual employment from 2010 through 2015. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or Group 2010 employment 2015 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.1 million 147.5 million 8.4 million 6.1 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.8 million 334.7 million 7.9 million 2.4 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.4 million 201.4 million 4.9 million 2.5 percent According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by about 8.4 million people. As Obama said, this is higher than all other advanced economies combined -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 7.9 million in the same time frame. And it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on the IMF’s list of advanced economies, including: Australia, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland. The country on this list with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of nearly 15 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is on target. What about the wording of putting "more people back to work," as Obama said? To support its claim when we fact-checked this a few months ago, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis "finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)." The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share "vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)." However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people "back to work," as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work in the United States alone, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009, the start of Obama’s presidency. Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 percent to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office. If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that "the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat." This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that "we’ve put more people back to work" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. "Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?" Sinclair said. "This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph." Our ruling Obama said, "Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined." From publicly available data, we know that since 2010, the United States has created more jobs than the 35 other advanced economies combined. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting "more people back to work," as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T00:42:29	2015-01-20	['Japan', 'Europe', 'United_States']
pomt-03461	Corporate tax holidays pushed by Presidents John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush brought "billions" of dollars back into the United States.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/18/johnny-isakson/corporate-tax-holiday-has-benefits-isakson-says/	In recent years, Republicans have been vocal about one particular way they say the federal government is anti-business. One of their main complaints is the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, a claim the PolitiFact franchise has repeatedly fact-checked with mixed reviews since the Truth-O-Meter started. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., was talking about the high corporate tax rates during a recent interview when he was asked whether there should a corporate tax holiday on off-shore profits? His answer piqued our interest. "Absolutely," he told Bloomberg radio. "It was done by John Kennedy. It was done by George W. Bush. Both times they did it, it brought back trillions or billions of dollars back into the United States which got reinvested in businesses and in jobs, and that’s exactly what we should do with the over $2 trillion that’s stranded now." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the senator’s claim that corporate tax holidays pushed by those two presidents brought "billions of dollars back into the United States." Some elected officials push a particular idea by saying a political icon on the other side of the aisle supported a similar approach. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has asked for support of various policies by saying Republican Ronald Reagan advocated fairly identical ideas. In this case, Isakson brought up the name of one of the most popular Democrats in U.S. history, JFK. We asked Isakson’s office for more details to back up their argument concerning Kennedy, who was president from January 1961 to November 1963, when he was assassinated. It took them a few days, but their argument was based on: Kennedy’s role in creating the Investment Tax Credit, which they said reduced corporate taxes significantly. Internal Revenue Code subpart F, which prevented the deferral of taxes owed by U.S.-controlled foreign corporations on untaxed income before being distributed to shareholders in the United States. Those proposals were passed in 1962. Economists and historians say Kennedy wanted these changes because he was concerned about the flow of money out of the United States and its impact on the gold standard. Kennedy took a multilayered approach to the economy, experts say. He proposed a tax cut, saying the top rate of 91 percent was way too high and deterred consumer spending. The tax cut plan did not pass until after his death, which was tweaked by Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson. "President Kennedy realized that high taxation could have harmful effects on the economy, and he acted to bring such high taxes down," Isakson’s office said via email. "President Kennedy enacted some very significant U.S. international tax reforms. The combined effect of President Kennedy’s tax legislation is often seen as having a positive impact on the U.S. economy." David Shreve has taught courses on economic history at the University of Virginia and closely studied Kennedy administration economic policies. Shreve, currently a research analyst at the university's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, explained via email that the Kennedy changes were "the polar OPPOSITE of a tax holiday." Through our research, we found little describing the changes to the code as a corporate tax holiday. Now, to the Bush corporate tax holiday. In October 2004, Congress passed what was called the most sweeping corporate tax legislation in a generation. The 650-page bill included a provision allowing companies with vast stores of offshore revenue to bring them home under a discount tax rate of 5.25 percent. Did it result in billions of dollars returning to the United States that were reinvested in jobs and businesses? The Internal Revenue Service reported that a small number of mostly large corporations repatriated nearly $362 billion from their controlled foreign corporations as a result of the 2004 holiday. In early 2011, Obama announced he would not pursue a similar type of tax holiday. The decision sparked all sorts of analyses of the 2004 tax holiday. There were many questions about its results. "Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it increased U.S. investment or jobs, and it cost taxpayers billions," Assistant U.S. Treasury Department Secretary for Tax Policy Michael Mundaca wrote on the department’s website in March 2011. A May 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded another tax holiday similar to what was done in 2004 would have positive short-term results, but it raised questions about the holiday’s long-term effectiveness. The conservative Heritage Foundation posted an article in 2011 that concluded the 2004 tax holiday produced immediate results but "the evidence is clear that these repatriations did not produce the hoped-for subsequent surge in domestic investment." The article suggested the U.S. lower its corporate tax rate and a permanent partial exemption for future foreign-source earnings of all U.S. businesses. To sum up, Isakson’s comments were accurate about the Bush tax holiday, which brought $362 billion back into the U.S. There is, however, disagreement about its long-term effectiveness. There is even more disagreement about whether it’s correct to describe what Kennedy did as a corporate tax holiday. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-07301	On taxes, President Barack Obama wants to raise "the top rate to 44.8 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-barack-obama-wants-top-tax-rate-448/	Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- the author of a budget plan that won approval from the Republican-held House but which was assailed by Democrats because it proposes significant changes in how Medicare works -- gave a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago on May 16, 2011. In it, he criticized President Barack Obama on tax policy. Ryan said that his own budget plan makes "the tax code simpler, flatter, fairer, more globally competitive and less burdensome for working families and small businesses. By contrast, the president says he wants to eliminate deductions, but he also wants to raise rates. That includes raising the top rate to 44.8 percent. That would amount to a $1.5 trillion tax increase on families and job creators." A reader e-mailed us to ask whether the president really wants to raise rates to 44.8 percent, since the most widely discussed Obama tax proposal is to reinstate marginal income tax rates that were in effect for the wealthiest taxpayers before approval of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts proposed by President George W. Bush. As the reader pointed out, Obama’s proposal to let Bush’s tax cuts lapse would raise the top marginal income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent -- not to the 44.8 percent that Ryan cited. We began by asking Ryan’s staff what he had meant by using that figure. Spokesman Conor Sweeney forwarded us a document that provided the reasoning that Ryan used to get to the 44.8 percent. Here’s the relevant portion of that document: Top statutory rate, 2010: 35 percent Expiration of 2001/2003 lower rates, 2011: 39.6 percent PEP/Pease provisions reinstated, 2011: 41.6 percent Net 2.3 percent Medicare tax on wages/salary: 43.9 percent 0.9 percent nondeductible Medicare tax, 2013: 44.8 percent We’ve already discussed the references to the 35 percent and 39.6 percent figures. Here’s a rundown of the rest: • PEP/Pease. These are two caps on how much income is subject to taxation for wealthy Americans. (Most Americans do not earn enough to trigger them.) The first, the "personal exemption phase-out," limits the benefit of the personal exemption for taxpayers earning above a set amount of income. The second sets a similar cap for itemized deductions. The two taxes were steadily reduced under the Bush tax cuts, disappearing entirely for 2010. The two caps are set to be revived in 2012, like the rest of the Bush tax cuts, unless Congress and the president agree to intervene. Ryan’s staff and tax experts we consulted with disagreed somewhat over how big a hit the PEP and Pease revivals would be, but their estimates ranged from about 1 to 2 added percentage points. So on the low end of that scale, Ryan’s estimate is slightly high, but the difference is modest. • Medicare taxes. Currently, the Medicare tax is 2.9 percent, split evenly between the employee and the employer. The new health care law would add a 0.9 percent, nondeductible tax to the employee’s side, so the new total is 3.8 percent, of which 2.35 percent is borne by the employee and 1.45 percent by the employer. To that employee share, Ryan added almost a percentage point to account for what he sees as lower employee salaries due to the employer’s share of the payroll tax. On balance, Ryan estimates the combined net increase from Medicare taxes to be 3.2 percent. So for Medicare taxes as well, Ryan’s staff made some assumptions that would be open to critique. But once again, the range of possible rate increases is fairly small -- about one percentage point. So even if you don’t buy Ryan’s assumptions, the most he’d be off in his final number is about 2 percentage points. Now, how about the way Ryan described his number? Usually, we’ve seen politicians use the term "the top rate" to refer to the marginal income tax rate for the highest tax bracket, not that tax rate plus several other taxes. So, one could say that using the 44.8 percent figure is a subtle way of adding an extra 5.2 percentage points to Obama’s tax proposal, making it look more draconian. But when we asked both liberal and conservative economists what they thought about Ryan’s phrasing, most were largely untroubled. "For non-tax people, I suppose he could have specified that 44.8 would be the combined marginal tax rate, though it's not clear that would have helped the average person understand," said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "Short of engaging in lengthy digressions, I'm not sure what Ryan could have done differently." If Ryan had used a specific definition of the tax rates in his speech, such as "the effective marginal income tax rate," then "that would be misleading," added J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. But he didn’t, Foster said, and that gives him some space to define what he means. Dean Baker, a liberal economist, said he’d "give Ryan a pass on this." Ryan left out that most of the rates listed in the document would be reverting to prior levels, rather than being imposed for the first time by Obama, Baker said. However, on balance, Baker said he feels that Ryan’s statement "is largely true." So where does this leave us? On Ryan’s number, it’s possible to argue that the actual rate is as low as 42.8 percent rather than 44.8 percent, but that’s open to debate. On his description of what the number means, Ryan -- particularly given that he was working from a prepared speech -- could have been clearer by saying something like, "The various parts of Obama’s tax agenda would together push the highest marginal tax rate up to 44.8 percent." Still, the figure Ryan used is close to what the tax rate would be if Obama’s agenda is followed, and a cross-section of economists we asked thought that Ryan’s presentation of that number was reasonable. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-05-18T16:42:42	2011-05-16	['None']
pomt-02193	Because the EPA closed a lead smelter in Missouri, "all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!"	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/apr/25/chain-email/lead-bullets-will-have-come-overseas-after-epa-clo/	"We, the American public have been blindsided again by the Obama crowd!!!" warns a chain email. "Last Lead smelting plant -- gone." The email goes on to blame the "Evil Protection Agency" for shutting down a lead smelting plant, calling it "backdoor gun control" and saying it will result in the cost of bullets soaring. "All lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!" the email says, adding, "Long term what this means: Your investment in ammo may be your best investment. Guns will be plentiful but ammo will be another story. How does $3.75 a round (that's for one bullet) for a 9mm work for you? Box of 50 would only cost you $187.50." We wondered: Is the email correct to say that all lead for bullets will now have to come from overseas? The Doe Run plant We’ve been down this road before. In December, former Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida, stated on his website: "It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ... So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration." We rated West’s claim Pants on Fire. The shuttered smelter, operated by Doe Run, is located in Herculaneum, Mo. Facing regulatory concerns about its air-quality record, Doe Run announced in 2010 that it had reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri which included paying fines. Then, in December 2013, it shut down. We found no evidence that the EPA’s settlement had anything to do with gun control -- it was about pollution. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters, which are "terribly toxic sites," said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution, told us when we wrote fact-checked West. Lead can accumulate in the body from many sources, and it can severely hamper mental and physical development. "It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets," Rosner told PolitiFact. "The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant." Indeed, while the chain email blames Obama, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. That was during the Reagan administration. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president who presided over an advance in the national anti-lead effort. In 2008, during the tenure of President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. Doe Run’s primary smelter -- a plant that extracts lead from ore -- was the last primary smelter in the country. But Doe Run continues to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. That includes -- you guessed it -- bullets. A company spokeswoman told us in December that more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications. "In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product," the company said in a statement. "These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri." In our previous fact check, Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey told us that the company "will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead." We contacted Stankey again for this fact-check. "The primary smelter did close, (but) we are still supplying ammo customers through our only secondary smelter," she told us. "We do know that primary lead is being imported to the U.S., but we don’t know if it is specific to ammunition suppliers. ... There are many other uses of lead." Ammunition experts Now that the Doe Run primary smelter has been shuttered for a few months, we checked back with ammunition experts to see whether there’s any evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. An NRA spokesman referred us to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Spokesman Mike Bazinet told us for this fact-check that "almost all the lead used in ammunition in the U.S. comes from secondary sources, recycled car batteries and other sources of lead. The closing of the lead smelter has not had any effect on ammunition prices or availability. ... Lead for bullets comes from secondary sources, and that was not completely understood by people out there. We certainly tried explain that it's had virtually no effect on ammunition prices." While some ammunition is imported to the U.S. from overseas, "it would be pretty heavy stuff to send (lead) across the ocean and put into a bullet. There are secondary sources of lead in sufficient quantity in the United States." Tom Falone -- president of Clearwater-based Florida Bullet, which supplies ammunition to law-enforcement agencies in Florida -- said its manufacturer has been using reclaimed lead for years. "I think that by the time we see a shortage, the industry will have found another material to replace the lead with," Falone said. Our ruling A chain email said that following closure of a lead smelter in Missouri, "all lead for bullets will have to come from overseas!" While the closure of a Doe Run primary lead smelter in December 2013 means there are no smelters to make lead from ore anywhere in the United States, smelters to recycle lead remain in operation, and their output is substantial enough to satisfy the needs of ammunition manufacturers. Four months after that particular smelter closed, we found no evidence that all lead for bullets now comes from overseas. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12657	Says Paul Manafort "played a very limited role" in the Trump presidential campaign.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/sean-spicer/sean-spicers-false-claim-paul-manafort-played-mino/	Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to distance the White House from President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has come under intense scrutiny recently for alleged ties to the Russian government. Manfort’s name was mentioned more than two dozen times in a Monday hearing before the House Intelligence committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and exclusive reporting today by the Associated Press alleges Manafort worked to advance Kremlin interests years before his involvement in the Trump campaign. "Obviously there’s been discussion of Paul Manafort, who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time," Spicer said in a March 20 White House press briefing, responding to a reporter’s question about references to Manafort during the hearing. That struck us as wrong, and Spicer seemed to walk back his comments in a subsequent press conference -- while still downplaying Manafort’s role. "I know I commented on this the other day and clearly, I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role, so let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts," Spicer said. Given the White House's continued efforts to distance itself from Manafort, we decided to review the facts ourselves around his involvement in the Trump campaign. Manafort’s early role in the Trump campaign In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention. In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as "a great asset and an important addition" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season. "Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party," Trump said in a statement that highlighted Manafort’s extensive political experience in "dozens of international political campaigns." About a week later, Trump expanded Manafort’s portfolio to include all functions related to the nomination process, as well as additional roles coordinating outreach efforts and establishing a new office in Washington, D.C. "I am organizing these responsibilities under someone who has done this job successfully in many campaigns," Trump said in a statement. "Paul is a well-respected expert in this regard and we are pleased to have him join the efforts to Make America Great Again." Manafort also began appearing on national television to represent the campaign. Manafort’s April 24 appearance on Fox News Sunday was posted on the Trump campaign’s official website, for example. (The post has since been removed, but can be seen here.) In his Sunday show interview, Manafort defended Trump’s campaign style and evolving strategy, and went on offense against then-Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, calling Trump’s most formidable rival for the Republican nomination a "liar." Manafort’s promotion to Trump campaign chairman and chief strategist On May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist. Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said that Corey Lewandowski, who had been managing the Trump campaign, would "continue overseeing day-to-day operations and will work with Manafort on political strategy and communications, among other things, through the general election." In weeks leading up to the July Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign announced it had hired veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway to "serve as senior advisor to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort." Roughly one month after the July GOP convention, with Trump’s poll numbers in decline and the campaign dealing with ongoing controversy, Trump announced Manafort’s resignation, concluding Manafort’s 20-week tenure with the campaign. "This morning Paul Manafort offered, and I accepted, his resignation from the campaign," Trump said in an August 19 statement." I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process. Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success." Our ruling Spicer said Manafort had a "limited" role with the Trump campaign, but even Spicer admitted himself that characterization wasn’t correct. Not only did Manafort work to consolidate Trump's support ahead of the Republican National Convention, but he was later promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. He made multiple media appearances on behalf of Trump and worked alongside Trump’s closest advisers. We rate Spicer’s statement False.

pomt-13269	"We've had Muslims in America since George Washington."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/13/hillary-clinton/clinton-sys-muslims-have-been-america-george-washi/	A Muslim woman at the second presidential debate asked Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton how they would help millions of Muslims in the United States "deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country." Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Muslims have to report problems, because "if they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country." And Clinton, his Democratic rival, won’t use the term "radical Islamic terrorism," Trump said, which we have said is misleading. Clinton said she wanted Muslims to feel included in the country, "part of our homeland security." "We've had Muslims in America since George Washington," Clinton said. "And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali." We wondered about Clinton’s remarks about Muslims being in America since the nation’s first president, more than 200 years ago. There are about 2.75 million Muslims in America, according to estimates by Pew Research Center. Islam is the second-largest religion in the world after Christianity and the fastest growing. Muslims were singled out this election cycle when Trump in December 2015 called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," until U.S. representatives "can figure out what is going on." Trump’s statement came a few days after a husband and wife in San Bernardino, Calif., fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 others. The woman was from Pakistan and on the day of the attack pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, a terrorist group also known as ISIS. In June 2016, Trump said he was revising his plan, and would suspend immigration from areas with "proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats." After the mass shooting in California and other attacks in Paris, hate crimes against Muslims spiked in the United States, the New York Times reported. Given statements about banning Muslims from coming to the United States and the attacks some already in the country are facing, Clinton’s comment about their presence in the country dating back hundreds of years seemed relevant. Muslim slaves Clinton’s campaign pointed us to a Feb. 9, 2015, opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter Manseau, who has written about American history and religions. "No matter how anxious people may be about Islam, the notion of a Muslim invasion of this majority-Christian country has no basis in fact," Manseau’s New York Times piece said. "Moreover, there is an inconvenient footnote to the assertion that Islam is anti-American: Muslims arrived here before the founding of the United States — not just a few, but thousands." Muslims have been "overlooked because they were not free to practice their faith," Manseau wrote. Manseau’s piece discusses a man called Estevanico who was raised in Azemmour, a Moroccan city that was once a "Muslim stronghold against European invasion." In 1528, an enslaved Estevanico and Spanish explorers were shipwrecked near present-day Galveston, Texas. Estevanico eventually escaped his Christian captors and lived in the Southwest, Manseau wrote. In the 1700s, Louisiana plantation owners "made it a point to add enslaved Muslims to their labor force, relying on their experience with the cultivation of indigo and rice," the New York Times piece said. Arabs in America, a project at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, also says scholars believe Estevanico was a practicing Muslim, "though he nominally converted to Catholicism to appease his Spanish masters." The Clinton campaign also sent over a Q&A page on Tolerance.org about Muslims that says they arrived in America more than 400 years ago as slaves and that many practiced their faith in secret. They also pointed to a PBS feature on Islam in America that says 10 to 15 percent of African slaves were believed to be Muslims. Experts also backed up Clinton’s claim. Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, a professor of religion and humanities at Reed College, also noted that the National Portrait Gallery includes a portrait of Yarrow Mamout, identified as an African-American Muslim man and former slave. "His portrait reminds us that Muslims have been a part of the fabric of this nation since the beginning," Kim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said in a July 2016 press statement when it was announced the portrait would be added as part of the museum’s annual rotations. Scholars also referred us to a post about the Founding Fathers and Islam by James H. Hutson, chief of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress. "Readers may be surprised to learn that there may have been hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims in the United States in 1776 — imported as slaves from areas of Africa where Islam flourished," Hutson wrote. "Although there is no evidence that the Founders were aware of the religious convictions of their bondsmen, it is clear that the Founding Fathers thought about the relationship of Islam to the new nation and were prepared to make a place for it in the republic." Washington said he would welcome Muslims to Mount Vernon (his home) "if they were ‘good workmen’," Hutson said. Washington also "suggested a way for Muslims to ‘obtain proper relief’ " from a proposed bill in Virginia levying taxes to aid Christian worship, according to Hutson. The post goes on to detail how the Founding Fathers in 1780 made sure the Constitution afforded "the most ample liberty of conscience … to Deists, Mahometans, Jews and Christians’," Hutson wrote. "I think that what Secretary Clinton was suggesting by her reference to George Washington was that not only have Muslims lived in the U.S. for centuries, but that our Founding Fathers — not only George Washington but also Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and the men who wrote the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution — believed that Muslims should be free to practice their own religion, and they tried to guarantee this freedom and protect it in some of our Founding documents," said Jan Ellen Lewis, a history professor at Rutgers University who has contributed $700 to Clinton’s campaign. Our ruling Clinton said, "We've had Muslims in America since George Washington." History scholars, studies and information from the Library of Congress say Muslims have been in the United States for hundreds of years, certainly dating back to Washington. Though Muslims were brought to America as slaves from Africa, experts believe many were not able to freely practice their religion. The Founding Fathers eventually outlined freedom of religion, among other rights.

pomt-00337	Says 3,000 people "did not die" in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. That death toll estimate was "done by Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/18/donald-trump/trump-lacks-proof-puerto-rico-hurricane-death-toll/	As Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas, President Donald Trump stirred a tweetstorm of his own creation by continuing to deride an estimated death toll from two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico last year. He said the count of Puerto Ricans killed by Hurricane Maria jumped from 16 during his October visit to 64 deaths a few months later, and "then, like magic, ‘3000 PEOPLE KILLED.'" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com He said in a second tweet that a method by George Washington University researchers to come up with a death count "was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s defiance echoed his initial tweets Sept. 13 in which he said 3,000 people "did not die" from the storms and that such a number was boosted by counting deaths from "old age." Turning conspiratorial, he said it was "done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump ignores basic facts about reality for Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Irma and Maria after September 2017. Trump also miscasts the estimate as a Democratic effort when it was created by experts on disaster response. There was no "magic" to the increase in the death toll estimates. It is based in science. "Early after a disaster, death tolls tend to be preliminary," said Roberto Rivera, College of Business University of Puerto Rico. "In the case of Hurricane Maria, indirect deaths are the reason the toll was so high, as suggested by some reports. That's the context that Trump is missing." Death toll estimates by academics The government in Puerto Rico initially reported 16 deaths in September 2017, and raised it to 34 in October and then 64 in December. But for months, researchers had said that the government’s official count was an undercount. Part of a death toll is a count of direct deaths from a storm, such as being struck by a falling tree or drowning in a flood. The more complicated count comes from indirect deaths caused by unsafe or unhealthy conditions, such as someone who relies on a respirator but loses electricity. Usually, the death toll of an event such as Hurricane Maria is determined through an exam by a medical examiner. But Puerto Rico officials did not have the proper resources to effectively conduct forensic examinations. Without complete medical records, researchers were left with other ways to try to come up with an estimate. Multiple studies used different methodologies and time periods, and therefore arrived at different results about "excess deaths" — comparing the number of deaths with historical trends during the time period in previous years. Excess death measurement has been a standard in the measurement of deaths attributable to environmental and climate events since the early 1960s, said Alexis Santos-Lozada, an assistant teaching professor at Pennsylvania State University. However, in some ways the case in Puerto Rico is unique. Before Hurricane Maria, governors and stakeholders were usually the first ones to raise alarm about the number of deaths — as the mayor of New Orleans did after Hurricane Katrina. "This was not the case of Puerto Rico, in Puerto Rico we turned to estimates because both the governor and the president minimized the number," Santos-Lozada said. Origins of the 3,000 estimate Trump was referring to an estimate published in late August by George Washington University’s Milken Institute. That estimate was higher than some earlier estimates by academics and the New York Times that were around 1,000, but lower than the 4,645 midpoint of a Harvard study. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló contacted George Washington University in December, which led to commissioning the university to do a study. The Milken Institute published the first phase Aug. 28 and found a midpoint of 2,975 excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane. That number was 22 percent higher than the number of deaths that would have been expected during that period in a year without the storm. Researchers found that lack of communication and training for doctors about how to certify deaths resulted in an undercount. Trump misrepresents what the Milken Institute study actually concluded about deaths. The study did not include anyone who died for "any reason, like old age," as he said. If that were the case, the number of deaths would have been much higher. The study found that there were 16,608 total deaths during the six months — and approximately 77 percent were at least 65 years old. The study didn’t attribute individual deaths to Maria; it tried to determine a number of "excess" deaths. In other words, it tried to find how many deaths would have been expected were it not for the but rather came up with a counterfactual: how many deaths would you expect to see each month if the hurricane hadn’t happened and then subtract the actual number to arrive at an "excess" number of deaths. Dr. John "Jack" Sandberg, an associate professor in the department of global health, told PolitiFact that the contract stipulated that the study would be done with no government interference by officials in Puerto Rico — and none occurred. "I did the number crunching on this, no one ever said boo to me about anything," he said. "We are quite shocked that this is having political repercussions." Lynn Goldman, the dean of the Milken Institute, responded to Trump's tweets in a Washington Post op-ed. "To set the record straight, our study was carried out with no interference whatsoever from any political party or institution," she wrote of the study done in collaboration with scientists at the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health. "We do not know the exact circumstances around each of the 2,975 excess deaths that occurred. Many factors — disruption in transportation, access to food, water, medications, power and other essentials — may have contributed." The government in Puerto Rico accepted the Milken institute study and raised Maria's official death toll from 64 to 2,975. The study's next phase is expected to more closely examine the identified deaths to look at causes through interviews with family members and medical personnel. Our ruling Trump tweeted that 3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that the death toll estimate was "done by Democrats." Trump tried to cast doubt on an estimate by George Washington University that includes indirect deaths. Studies by other academics or researchers have also concluded that the number of deaths was above 1,000. The death toll provided by the government in Puerto Rico did rise after the storm from 16 to 64 in the months following the storm. The government then hired George Washington University to research an estimate and several months later it produced a report estimate 2,975 deaths. None of that is evidence of an estimate created by a Democratic conspiracy to make Trump look bad. We rate this statement False.

pomt-09622	Says a careless attitude and "poor oversight by the Texas Department of Agriculture" led to deaths and illnesses traced to a Texas peanut plant.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-agencys-lax-attitude-allowed-sal/	East Texas Democrat Hank Gilbert, running a second time for state agriculture commissioner, blasted out of the chute with a dramatic claim about the agency he wants to head. Gilbert, hoping to deny Republican Commissioner Todd Staples a second term, said Dec. 14: "A careless, lackadaisical attitude has already resulted in the deaths of eight and more than 600 cases of illness nationally thanks to poor TDA oversight at the former Peanut Corporation of America factory in Plainview." He was referring to eight (the count actually reached nine) deaths due to salmonella poisonings traced to the corporation's since-shuttered Plainview peanut plant. We wondered if Gilbert accurately characterized the department's role in ensuring safe food processing plants. It turns out that a department inspector did visit the offending Peanut Corporation of America plant in 2005, 2006 and 2008 and also checked a box on a form filed after each visit stating that the plant had a license required by the state health department to operate. But the Lubbock-based inspector, who was visiting the plant to certify it as organic, has admitted to making false assumptions about its health certification on each inspection. When his actions came to light in the wake of the salmonella crisis, he was fired. The inspector, Gaylon Armonett, told the Associated Press the reason he checked "yes" the first time was that a plant manager told him an application for state health licensing had been completed and was in the hands of officials at the company's headquarters. Armonett said he checked "yes" in the succeeding years because he assumed the license was granted. "It's an inadvertent mistake," Armonett said, "and I'm sorry for it." Agriculture department spokesman Bryan Black suggested it wasn’t the department’s responsibility to police any plant’s cleanliness. "Local and state health departments are responsible for protecting consumers from food-borne illnesses," Black said. "TDA certifies products and processes to national organic standards and has strict protocols in place." The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed that firms like the peanut plant that manufacture food for sale to the public must have a state-issued food manufacturer license. The agency has said it didn’t know of the Plainview plant until the salmonella outbreak. The plant closed in February. "We never received an application for a license," DSHS spokeswoman Allison Lowery said. "As you can understand, it would be very difficult for us to know about a company when it fails to license with us." Lowery continued: "As soon as we were aware of the problems... we immediately ordered the company to close this plant and recall all products made there. We also quickly took over the recall after we got no response from the company to our recall order. And we assessed $14.6 million in administrative penalties against the company." In his statement about the peanut plant, Gilbert overstates the agriculture department's role; it's not the primary agency responsible for policing such facilities for health hazards. Still, its inspector admittedly slipped up in this case. If he'd flagged the Plainview plant for lacking the required food manufacturer license, it might have been shut down or its conditions improved. That could have prevented the 2009 illnesses and deaths. We rate Gilbert’s statement Half True.	None	Hank Gilbert	None	None	None	2010-01-12T15:28:04	2009-12-14	['Texas']
pomt-01196	"794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/02/facebook-posts/meme-says-barack-obama-has-given-no-special-recogn/	Recent events in Ferguson, Mo., have inspired waves of anger on social media. Recently, a reader asked us to check one of the memes now circulating on the Internet. The meme pairs two images. One captures several flag-draped coffins, presumably of law enforcement officers. The other is a still from surveillance footage showing Michael Brown allegedly assaulting an employee at a convenience store that he’s suspected of robbing the day he was killed by police officer Darren Wilson. To these images, the meme adds the following text: "Want to know where racial tension and cultural divide comes from? "794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House. "A man robs a convenience store and assaults a cop; the White House sends three representatives to his memorial service." The meme appears to stem from the "Culture Crisis in America" Facebook community, which describes itself as "an e-magazine for Americans subscribing to the notion that the cultural deterioration of American values rests within the root of economic and social crises across our land, and indeed, the globe." We’ll quickly note that, according to news reports, the White House did send three representatives to the service for Brown: Broderick Johnson, chairman of the My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Heather Foster, an adviser in the public engagement office. (Marshall had personal as well as professional reasons to attend; he’s a St. Louis native and attended high school with Brown's mother.) Here, we'll focus on the meme's claim that Obama has been indifferent to law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, giving them "no special recognition." Is that correct? Have 794 officers been killed in the line of duty since Obama was inaugurated? The meme footnotes its figure to the website Officer Down Memorial Page, a privately run page that memorializes and keeps count of the number of police killed in action every year. Between 2009 and Dec. 2, 2014, the site counted 834 deaths. The lower number on the meme probably because the number of deaths has increased since its creator first looked up the number. Due to differences in methodology, the Officer Down Memorial Page figure is somewhat higher than the official federal statistics, which are accessible in an FBI database known as "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted." The FBI figures show 521 deaths from 2009 to 2013, roughly half from felonious homicides and half from accidents in the line of duty. If you extrapolate the numbers to include 2014, that would work out to roughly 625 deaths. That’s smaller than what was cited in the meme, but given the diversity of criteria that can be used to calculate this statistic, we’re not overly concerned about the meme’s number. (The Officer Down Memorial Page, for instance, counts deaths off-duty "while acting in an official capacity to prevent loss of property, injury, or death, or is targeted because of his/her duties as a law enforcement officer.") One footnote: The numbers of fallen officers have been declining rather noticeably in recent years. According to the FBI statistics, the number of officers killed initially rose from 96 in 2009 to 128 in 2010, but then began falling, to 125, then 96 and finally to 76 in 2013. That’s a 41 percent decline in three years. Has there been "no special recognition from the White House" for fallen officers? This is where the meme is entirely off-base. We found many instances of White House "special recognition" for fallen officers. Here’s a selection of events where Obama has appeared, all archived a few quick keystrokes away on the White House website: • May 7, 2010: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: "As a nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger communities." • May 15, 2010: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "To the survivors of fallen law enforcement officers, our hearts go out to you for your loss. The husbands and wives, mothers and fathers you loved, they protected us all. And all Americans are grateful for the lives that they gave in the line of duty." • May 12, 2011: Presidential remarks at a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoring National Association of Police Organizations "Top Cops" Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Tomorrow we know that you and your fellow first responders will be back on your diligent duty -- looking out for us, looking out for one another, looking back at times with fallen partners, determined to make sure that their extraordinary sacrifices were not in vain. And we will be standing behind you, as one nation and one people, proud of your actions, awed by your courage, and grateful for your service on our behalf." • May 15, 2012: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Today, with heavy hearts, we honor those who gave their lives. .... Their families are in our thoughts and prayers, as we remember the quiet courage of the men and women we have lost. … The rest of us can never fully understand what you go through. But please know that we hold you in our hearts -- not just today, but always. We are forever in your debt. And it is on behalf of all of us, the entire American people, that I offer my thoughts, my prayers, and my thanks. May God shine a light upon the fallen and comfort the mourning. May he protect the peacemakers who protect us every day." • May 15, 2013: Presidential remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service at the U.S. Capitol. Excerpt from Obama’s remarks: "Scripture tells us, ‘None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.’ The brave officers we gather to remember today devoted themselves so fully to others -- to serve and to protect others -- that in the process they were willing to give their lives. And so, today, let us not remember them just for how they died, but also for how they lived. … We can never repay our debt to these officers and their families, but we must do what we can, with all that we have, to live our lives in a way that pays tribute to their memory." • May 9, 2014: Presidential proclamation for Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week. Excerpt from proclamation: "During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we celebrate those who protect and serve us every minute of every day, and we honor the courageous officers who devoted themselves so fully to others that in the process they laid down their lives. As we mourn the fallen, let us also remember how they lived." Our ruling The Facebook meme said that "794 law enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty since B.H. Obama took office, with no special recognition from the White House." While the meme offered a reasonable approximation for the number of fallen officers, the meat of its accusation -- that Obama has ignored the suffering of law enforcement officers killed in action -- is demonstrably wrong. We found at least six instances in which Obama honored the lives of fallen officers in writing or in speeches. Archived information about these events was easily available to the public on the White House website, meaning that the meme’s creator was reckless in not taking them into account.

pomt-13122	"Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs."	false	/florida/statements/2016/nov/03/consumers-smart-solar/amendment-1-backers-promise-protections-seniors-of/	Organizers for a proposed constitutional amendment about electricity generated by solar power have told voters their proposal would safeguard consumers — especially seniors. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-backed group behind Amendment 1, has spent millions to promote the measure in commercials, mailers and web ads. "Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs," claimed one ad on YouTube Oct. 19, 2016. We wanted to know how the amendment would keep seniors from being targeted. When we shined a light on the measure, we found Amendment 1 doesn’t provide any new protections, for seniors or anyone else. Solar support Supporters of the Amendment 1 campaign say the constitutional change promotes solar while protecting consumers. Critics have derided the amendment, accusing organizers of obscuring their true, backdoor intention of helping established utilities control Florida’s solar market and punish electric consumers for using solar panels. So how does the amendment protect seniors, or anyone else? On its own, Amendment 1 doesn’t. All the wording says is that current consumer protections can remain in place. Along with saying people may still buy solar panels and install them, the measure reads (emphasis ours): "State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do." The second half concerns the future of net metering, in which solar customers sell excess electricity back to the utilities. Net metering is currently overseen by Florida Public Service Commission rules. But the first half essentially says the amendment will not preclude any current or future state law or regulation. No legal protections would change. "This provision makes clear that regardless of what course Florida takes with solar energy now or in the future, government will not relinquish its responsibility to protect consumers," a Consumers for Smart Solar spokeswoman told us. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn’t give any examples when we asked them how solar customers may currently be protected. The attorney general’s office said consumers with specific problems can file a complaint with them under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. The office reviews each complaint for appropriate action. You may have noticed the amendment does not spell out special protection for seniors. But here’s where Consumers for Smart Solar’s argument comes in. They cited an August 2016 letter to the Federal Trade Commission from Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group. The letter said Public Citizen hoped the FTC would consider new regulations on "arrangements in which consumers lease their solar system from a corporate third-party." Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. In those deals, customers sign a lease for a period of time, usually a number of years, agreeing to buy power from the solar company. Florida customers are still allowed to lease the panels themselves, as long as they don’t sell the excess electricity to anyone, such as a landlord selling power to tenants. Consumers for Smart Solar pointed to Arizona, where solar companies bilked older customers who didn’t fully understand their lease agreements. But it’s not clear how this applies to Florida, because those kinds of deals aren’t allowed in this state. State law makes it so that someone generating electricity with solar panels can’t sell it to anyone but utility companies. The net metering clause matters here, too, because third-party companies in other states depend on the money they would get from selling electricity to utilities. The amendment would conceivably make that business model unworkable, were third-party sales ever allowed. Florida's two largest utilities, Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy have said they want to see Florida's net metering law changed to impose new fees on customer-owned solar users. More than one legal expert told us it’s ambiguous at best to say Amendment 1 offers protections. That’s up to state and local officials, who already have laws and regulations in place. Seniors aren’t specifically mentioned anywhere in the amendment’s wording. "The only defined user of electricity in the amendment is ‘consumer,’" Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. "I think it is misleading to suggest that it does have a particular concern for seniors. It seems more in the genre of ‘scare tactic’ rather than accurate information." Our ruling Consumers for Smart Solar said, "Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs." The amendment’s wording doesn’t mention seniors specifically, it only lets current consumer protection laws stand. That means the measure doesn’t preclude any protections, but it also doesn’t provide any. If there were no amendment at all, the effect on consumer laws and regulations would be the same.

pomt-06964	Under Ryan plan, "those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by members of Congress."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/15/scott-rigell/rigell-says-gop-medicare-plan-offers-those-under-5/	Seeking to dispel concerns that House Republicans want to end Medicare and push granny off a cliff, U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd, recently reached out to his constituents. In a letter titled "An open and honest conversation about Medicare," Rigell defended House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan’s "Path to Prosperity Plan" and attempted to address the "misinformation coming out of Washington" about it. Rigell laid out a series of "facts," the first of which reads: "Under the Path to Prosperity, there are no changes to Medicare for anyone 55 and older; those 54 and younger would receive the same kind of healthcare options now enjoyed by Members of Congress." We thought it worthwhile to look into the assertion that Americans 54 and younger would enjoy the same type of health care Rigell does. PolitiFact national has walked this road in April, checking a claim from Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. As pointed out in that fact check, Medicare is currently a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: "When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks." Ryan’s proposal would require the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, an agency that administrates the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, through which members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan’s plan would gradually raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provide smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found it would save the government money. But it would do so by requiring future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Now let’s compare the benefits under Ryan’s plan to what members of Congress can buy. How the plan is like what members of Congress get. Asked to support Rigell’s claim, a representative from his office passed along information from the House Budget Committee. It points out that like the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, the Ryan plan would provide seniors a list of approved plans from competing private insurance companies and allow them the flexibility to choose. Those plans would be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. The government would also pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise rates, through a formula known as "Fair Share." Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. "As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs," the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. So let’s look back. While Rigell’s office -- via the House Budget Committee -- points to similarities in the two plans’ flexibility, they remain fundamentally different at the core. At a minimum, the premium supports of the Medicare plan would not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and would not likely have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they would not receive the same protection against rising costs that "Fair Share" provides members of Congress. We rate Rigell’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10368	"The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/ralph-nader/number-stands-up-even-if-other-details-dont/	Perennial presidential candidate Ralph Nader is in an uphill battle for both media coverage and significant poll numbers. But somehow he's managing to get the latter without getting any of the former, he said in a recent radio interview. "The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama," Nader said during a June 18 interview on Democracy Now!, an independent, left-leaning radio program. Nader garnered less than half that in the 2000 election and, by many accounts, damaged Al Gore enough to hand George W. Bush the White House. We checked the Associated Press polls and found none that gave Nader 6 percent. The most recent AP poll prior to the interview was an AP-Yahoo poll from April 17 that had Nader at 3 percent. Nader spokesman Chris Driscoll acknowledged the candidate had erred, and said he meant to cite a June 6 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , which did indeed have Nader and his running mate Matt Gonzalez at 6 percent against Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, Republican Sen. John McCain and former GOP Rep. Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate. The finding needs context, though. Was it just an outlier? And what does it say about how Nader will do in November? Other recent polls show Nader with less support. A Rasmussen Reports poll released May 18 showed Nader pulling in 4 percent against Obama, McCain and Barr. A Reuters/Zogby poll released June 18 showed Nader with 3 percent. A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll released June 19, the day after Nader's interview, gave him 4 percent. History suggests, however, that even these polls overstate Nader's prospects. At this time in 2000, he was showing around 4 or 5 percent in most national polls, and he ended up with 2.7 percent of the vote. Around this time in 2004, polls had Nader at anywhere from 3 to 7 percent. He got just .38 percent in the end. Now, onto Nader's assertion that his support has come "without any national coverage." Clearly he was speaking rhetorically — we found his name mentioned 166 times on the major broadcast and cable news programs between the first of the year and the June 18 interview. But that's six months. Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him. We are also reluctant to pick on Nader too much for getting the name of a poll wrong. So with the caveat that his claim says little about how he'll do in November, we find it Mostly True.

pomt-05574	In "the past 10 years, our (Austin) water rates have increased by 100 percent and we now have the highest water cost of the top 10 cities in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/04/brigid-shea/brigid-shea-says-austin-water-rates-doubled-decade/	Austin mayoral candidate Brigid Shea, suggesting city leaders have failed to bird-dog affordability, referred to water costs in a March 5, 2012, op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman. "One example is that in the past 10 years, our water rates have increased by 100 percent and we now have the highest water cost of the top 10 cities in Texas," Shea wrote. "And this is before the water utility plans to raise costs by another 19 percent by 2016." The 19 percent figure is in keeping with the Austin Water Utility’s forecasts of future revenue needs, utility executive David Anders told us in a telephone interview. For this fact check, we’re gauging Shea’s claim that water rates doubled, which the utility concedes, and that water here costs more now than in other big Texas cities. To our inquiry, Shea said by email that she drew upon a report posted online in February 2012 by an Austin environmental activist and consumer advocate, Paul Robbins, who edits the Austin Environmental Directory. Robbins’ report, funded in part by the Save Our Springs Alliance, used his methodology to compare water and wastewater costs in Austin to costs in other big Texas cities as well as nearby towns and cities, though we’re not exploring those comparisons because Shea did not speak to that. Between 2000 and 2012, Robbins’ report says, Austin’s water rates went up 100 percent and its wastewater rates increased 97 percent. Over those years, the report says, inflation was 35 percent. Asked to respond, Jason Hill, a spokesman for the Austin Water Utility, did not quibble with that calculation of rate increases, saying by email that combined water and wastewater rates doubled from 2002 to 2012. But the utility looks at water costs differently, we learned. Robbins calculated that for water customers of all kinds -- residential, multifamily (as in apartments), commercial and industrial -- Austin’s 2011 cost of water was $4.87 per thousand gallons. Corpus Christi’s 2011 cost for the same amount of water, ranking second, was $4.12, the report says, with San Antonio’s cost, $4.11, ranking third among the state’s biggest cities. Austin did not come out No. 1 in all the water-cost breakdowns. Corpus Christi’s 2011 costs of water for multifamily and commercial customers exceeded Austin’s costs. Generally, the report says, Austin’s costs are higher for various reasons, including that debt service comprises 41 percent of the Austin utility’s combined 2012 water/wastewater bills. The report notes too that the population in the Austin utility’s service area increased 20 percent between 2000 and 2010 while, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the other nine large cities averaged 12 percent population growth. Also, the report says, annual transfers from the Austin utility’s proceeds to the city for other purposes are expected to total $36.5 million over the 12 months that began in October 2011. In 2000, the report says, such transfers totaled $17.2 million, which adjusted for inflation would be $28.5 million in 2012. Hill, the utility’s spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the utility had not calculated water costs in Robbins’ fashion. "We’re not in a tit for tat," Hill said. "He has an opinion on something, on how he’s done the mathematics. Our priority is not, ‘Oh, he’s completely wrong.’ We have our way of doing the rates." Utility official Daryl Slusher later said by email that the utility questions the "meaningfulness" of Robbins’ methodology which, Slusher noted, does not tease out how little a conserving Austin resident pays for water nor how much heavy residential users pay under the utility’s tiered rate structure. Robbins later acknowledged that, pointing out, though, that only Austin’s residential rates are tiered to encourage conservation, though other customers are charged slightly more during the hottest summer months. Slusher also pointed out that the utility’s annual surveys of rates in other cities indicate that based on average residential water consumption, Austin’s rates are not always highest. In 2011, the utility’s analysis says, the average Austin monthly residential water bill of $27.79 was greater than comparable bills in San Antonio, Arlington, Dallas, El Paso and Amarillo, though less than such bills in Fort Worth, Houston, Corpus Christi, Cedar Park, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock. In 2012, the utility says, the estimated average monthly residential water bill of $33.22 is expected to be less than comparable bills in Georgetown, Cedar Park, Corpus Christi, San Marcos, Pflugerville and Lubbock. Slusher said the 2012 projected average bill includes the new revenue stability fee, which took effect in November 2011. The utility says the fee -- $4.40 for a ⅝-inch water meter, with larger meters having a higher fee -- will generate $17 million in 2012 to be collected regardless of how much water is sold during the year. "On the other hand," Slusher said, "we acknowledge that Austin Water’s combined (water and wastewater) rates are among the highest in the state. Austin Water, however, delivers a lot of value for that cost." He listed among examples past actions to secure the water supply through 2100, manage land for water quality and endangered species protection, add a water treatment plant, expand the wastewater system’s reclaimed water system and encourage "green" energy choices. By email, Robbins said none of those items are unique to the Austin utility. Also, Slusher said, successes Austin has enjoyed conserving water, detailed in a November 2011 fact check, help explain the utility’s higher costs per thousands of gallons shown by Robbins’ methodology. "If our conservation programs had not achieved as much as they have then Austin Water’s cost per gallon in Mr. Robbins’ report would be much lower. So if the metric by which we measure ourselves were the one he uses in his report then there would be a disincentive to conserve," Slusher said. Our ruling Austin’s water/wastewater rates increased about 100 percent from 2000 to 2012, not taking inflation into account. And does water cost more in Austin than in the other biggest Texas cities? For residential customers, that depends on how much is used. Overall, if Austin doesn’t always have the highest water costs among the biggest Texas cities, it’s in the running. We rate Shea’s two-part claim Mostly True.	None	Brigid Shea	None	None	None	2012-04-04T06:00:00	2012-03-05	['Texas', 'Austin,_Texas']
pomt-10566	"While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/08/chain-email/a-new-twist-on-an-old-distortion/	A new chain e-mail against Barack Obama recycles some false charges and adds some false twists. The e-mail, forwarded to us by several readers, provides a new spin on the false claim that Obama refused to put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance. "Barack Hussein Obama will NOT recite the Pledge of Allegience nor will he show any reverence for our flag," it says. "While others place their hands over their hearts, Obama turns his back to the flag and slouches." We have previously examined e-mail allegations that he attended a radical Muslim school (so inaccurate we called it Pants on Fire), that he took the oath of office with a Koran (also Pants on Fire) and that his middle name is Mohammed (Pants on Fire). We've also explored the questions surrounding this photograph from Time magazine's Web site, which prompted the allegations that he "refused to say the pledge" (also False). Now comes a new allegation, apparently relying on the same photo. Since this one is new to many readers, we'll revisit some of our previous findings and address the new charge about slouching. (This is the first time we can recall slouching being used as the basis for a political attack.) The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16, 2007, in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the Time photo says Obama and the others "stand during the national anthem." Obama was on stage with New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Harkin's wife Ruth. As the Time caption indicates, the photo was taken during the national anthem, not the pledge, so the photo does not support the allegation that Obama "turns his back and . . . slouches" during the pledge. This is corroborated by an ABC News video of the occasion. It's clear from the video that the assembled Democrats are not turning their backs on the flag to make an antipatriotic statement. They are looking at the same point — presumably the woman singing the anthem. It is a matter of interpretation whether Obama is slouching as the anthem is played. The photo shows him with his hands clasped in front of his waist while the others have their hands over the heart (a point of anthem protocol that we addressed in this item). But it doesn't look to us like he's slouching and there's no evidence to suggest his posture was making an antipatriotic statement. Obama has responded to these allegations by saying he often leads the pledge when he presides over the Senate, as seen in this video from the Senate. So once again, we find a chain e-mail is incorrect about Obama. We find the statement False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-02-08T00:00:00	2008-01-06	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06053	Says that when Republicans held Congress and the presidency, they "doubled the size of the (U.S.) Department of Education."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/11/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-when-republicans-held-congress-and-p/	A day after Texas U.S. Rep. Ron Paul finished second in the Republican Party’s New Hampshire presidential primary, Charlie Rose of CBS News asked Paul to comment on the view that as conservatives fail to coalesce behind an alternative to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, they’re making it easier for Romney to win the party's nomination. "Yeah," Paul replied, "but what if you coalesce with big spending and you elect somebody like that and you do the big spending? This is what we’ve done. When we’ve had the House and the Senate and the presidency, we coalesced, and we increased the (national) debt, and we increased the spending, we doubled the size of the Department of Education, we passed (the) No Child Left Behind (Act), we passed Sarbanes Oxley. "Why should we coalesce behind conservatives who aren’t conservative?" Paul continued. "They’re just big government conservatives. That’s why there’s frustration out there. That’s why people have started the tea party movement. So I don’t know why people don’t understand this." We don’t doubt that federal spending and the debt were increased by Congress in past sessions and that Republicans aligned with Democrats to create the No Child Left Behind Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in January 2002, though Paul did not note that Democrats held a narrow Senate majority when the act advanced through that body in 2001. In July 2002, Bush signed into law the Sarbanes Oxley act, which was intended to enhance corporate responsibility and financial disclosures while combating corporate and accounting fraud. But were Republican majorities in Congress and a Republican president responsible for doubling the size of the education department? To our inquiry, Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, reminded us that PolitiFact in 2007 rated True this Paul statement: "It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education." The GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, the Senate for most of those years and the presidency from 2001 through 2008. Significantly, the earlier fact-check weighed spending over years when Republicans controlled the House and Senate, regardless of who was in the White House. And the education department’s appropriation was $100 billion in 2006, nearly quadruple the $27 billion appropriated in 1994. Adjusting for inflation — the 1994 budget rises to $36.8-billion when calculated in 2006 dollars — the increase was 172 percent. Much of the increase came as a result of the No Child Left Behind Act. In return for implementing a regimen of student testing and teacher accountability, states received an infusion of federal funds. Some perspective: The $100 billion education department appropriation in 2006 was by far the largest up to that year, and something of an anomaly. It marked a substantial increase from the 2005 funding level of $71.5 billion. In 2007, indeed, the budget fell to about $67 billion, a 75 percent increase over 1994 levels in inflation-adjusted terms — big, but not doubled. That 2006 bump was the result of a massive increase in mandatory spending related to student loan processing and to a one-time infusion of $4.3 billion to cover shortfalls in funding for grants to university students. Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs — including No Child Left Behind funding — are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year. Fast forward: Paul outlined more restrictive partisan conditions to CBS News, saying there was a doubling in the department when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress plus the presidency. Accordingly, let’s focus on spending over much of the first six years of Bush’s presidency when Republicans controlled Congress. From June 2001 into November 2002, Democrats narrowly held the Senate. So, how did the education agency’s funding change during Republican dominance? According to the department, its funding in fiscal 2001, which began before Bush became president, was $42 billion, which adjusting for inflation would have been $49.2 billion in 2007 dollars. The comparable figure for fiscal 2007, the last budget year over which Republicans held full sway, was $67 billion -- nearly 60 percent higher than such spending in 2001, 36 percent adjusted for inflation. This indicates that such spending went up under Republicans, but did not double. Still, there remains a way to suggest Republicans more than doubled the department’s funding. Cutting off the comparison in 2006, the year with the highest spending, results in an increase of 138 percent compared with 2001. Adjusted for inflation, the 2006 spending was 109 percent more than the agency was appropriated for 2001. Then again, the 2006 appropriation shakes out as the second-highest amount spent through the department for any year since 1980, according to the agency. It was later outpaced only by about $138 billion appropriated in fiscal 2009, an amount driven by nearly $100 billion in education spending included in the economic stimulus package approved that year. Excluding the stimulus year, appropriations to the department from 2007 through 2011 ranged from nearly $44 billion in 2011 to $68.5 billion in 2008. David Dunn of Austin, who was chief of staff to Bush’s secretary of education, told us in an interview that he considers the 2006 appropriation an aberration. Broadly, Dunn said, "we never felt like we doubled spending" on the department. "We knew spending increased significantly. We were proud of that." Paul’s campaign manager, Jesse Benton, stood by the PolitiFact check of Paul’s 2007 claim, saying by email: "...you are pathetic. You are about to contradict something that PolitiFact (al)ready fact checked. Why don'(t) you get a life?" Our ruling Paul’s comment to CBS News, reflecting on a shorter period than his 2007 claim, holds up by comparing spending in 2006 and 2001. However, in the last budget adopted when Republicans held full sway, the department's appropriation was 60 percent higher than in 2001, 36 percent accounting for inflation. That’s an increase, but not a doubling. One could also say Republicans cut the department’s appropriation between 2006 and 2007. Paul’s recent statement rates Half True.

pomt-13882	Says Donald Trump "spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/01/michael-caputo/trump-was-outspent-his-closest-primary-opponents/	After Donald Trump replaced campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, another aide, Michael Caputo, sent a tweet that read: "Ding dong the witch is dead!" Afterward, Caputo quickly resigned from the campaign. Since then, he’s been making the rounds on television. Caputo, who ran Republican Carl Paladino’s 2010 bid for governor in New York, appeared on Capital Tonight on Time Warner Cable News last week. During the segment, Trump’s finances came up. Trump had about $1.2 million on hand through the end of May. Hillary Clinton had $42.4 million. Caputo called Trump’s spending humble. "Donald Trump is not known for wasting money," Caputo said. "He spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly, and he doesn’t intend to start burning money in the middle of the street now." Caputo says he was referring to spending by Republican rivals who left the race: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also held out until late in the race. We wanted to know if Trump actually spent less during the primary than his closest competitors. Overall spending vs. spending during the campaign At first glance, the numbers show Trump spending more than his opponents. Filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Trump’s campaign spending has topped $63.3 million through May, which are the most recent filings. Only one GOP candidate spent more throughout the campaign: Ted Cruz spent $85.8 million. Among the candidates spending less than Trump: Rubio at $50.4 million, Carson at $62.4 million, Bush at $35.1 million, and Kasich at $18.8 million through the end of May. But if you break up that spending over a timeline of the primary, Caputo’s claim holds water. We looked at how much Trump spent compared to each candidate over the course of their respective campaigns. After Bush suspended his campaign at the end of February, his campaign reported spending $34.2 million. Through the same filing period, Trump’s spending was slightly less at $33.4 million. Carson dropped his bid just a few weeks later, in early March. His campaign spent $60.7 million through the end of February compared with Trump’s $33.4 million. Rubio dropped his bid in mid-March. Trump spent about $1 million more than Rubio by the end of the filing period that included March, but if you look at spending by both campaigns over individual days, Rubio’s campaign spent almost $4 million more than Trump before the Florida senator dropped his bid. Cruz suspended his campaign after losing to Trump in the Indiana primary on May 3. Campaign filings through the end of May show Cruz had spent $85.8 million to Trump’s $63.3 million. The one exception is Kasich, whose spending came in at just under $19 million through May - more than $40 million less than Trump. Caputo told PolitiFact New York he was not referring to the Ohio governor when he made the claim. Our ruling Caputo, a Trump supporter and former adviser, said, Trump "spent the least amount of money of any of the competitive primary contenders that he beat so badly." When Trump’s spending is looked at broadly over the course of the campaign, he appears to outspend the majority of his opponents through the end of May. But a review of his spending during the time rival candidates were still in the race shows a different result. All except Kasich spent more money than Trump before dropping out. It's also worth mentioning that Trump did not have any major funding from a superPAC, while some of his opponents did. The Right to Rise superPAC, for example, spent more than $80 million to elect Jeb Bush.

pomt-07800	The government will "go out and buy my breast pump for my babies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-government-will-buy-you-brea/	The Democrats are at it again, said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.: Trying to get the government to solve all our problems. "I’ve given birth to five babies, and I’ve breast-fed every single one of these babies," Bachmann said on The Laura Ingraham Show. "To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state." We decided to fact-check Bachmann’s catchy sound bite after seeing it repeated in the media this week. Bachmann’s comments were prompted by a decision from the Internal Revenue Service to change the way it classifies breast pumps and related supplies. Previously, the IRS said breast pumps were not medical expenses because they were related to nutrition. And nutrition -- i.e., food -- is not a medical expense. On Feb. 10, the IRS announced it had reconsidered, and that it had decided breast pumps are in fact used for medical care. Like obstetric care, breast pumps "are for the purpose of affecting a structure or function of the body of the lactating woman," the IRS said in its ruling. So does this mean free breast pumps for mom? Hardly. Formally, it means that breast pumps can be treated like other medical expenses that are tax deductible. Keep in mind, the hurdle for directly deducting medical expenses is quite high: The out-of-pocket expenses have to exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted income before you can begin deducting them. More commonly, it means people can now buy breast pumps using money from flexible health spending accounts. Many employers offer these accounts, which allow workers to save part of their paychecks tax-fee to a personal account that can be used only for health care costs. Because the money isn’t taxed, people are able to set aside more for health expenses than they would otherwise. The accounts have restrictions, though. There’s a limit to how much can go to the accounts, currently $2,500. People have to save all their receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if there’s money in the account at the end of the year, the employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies. In addition to the IRS announcement, breastfeeding has been in the news because First Lady Michelle Obama said recently that she hoped to promote breast-feeding through her "Let’s Move" campaign to prevent childhood obesity. Obama said that studies have linked breast-feeding to lower obesity rates. Radio host Laura Ingraham, who asked Bachmann about breast pumps, questioned Obama’s motivation for the "Let’s Move" campaign, and speculated that the First Lady might intend to run for office later. Bachmann, though, said she doubted that Obama was motivated by self-interest. "I think honestly she is really committed to the far left agenda, more than anything else," Bachmann said. We should note that Ingraham was accurate in explaining that breast pumps were being newly classified as a medical expense, and hence tax deductible. Bachmann, though, described the decision incorrectly when she said, "To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You want to talk about the nanny state? I think you just got a new definition of the nanny state." Those remarks have been widely reported. It’s a catchy sound bite, but like a lot of sound bites, it’s not so accurate. The government will not buy you a breast pump. Rather, it will now allow you to treat money you spend on the pumps as a deductible medical expense. Bachmann's statement suggests a large government program to purchase and provide the devices when in fact the government is actually treating them as tax-deductible, like countless other things. We rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-02-18T12:25:39	2011-02-15	['None']
pomt-02060	Senate immigration legislation is the "Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/28/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-senate-immigration-reform-efforts/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor is facing his most significant primary challenge since he first won the Republican nomination for his Virginia congressional seat in 2000. With a few weeks to go before the June 10 election, he has hammered his opponent, Randolph-Macon College professor Dave Brat, on the air with negative ads while seeking to boost his own conservative credentials. In short, he’s taking the challenge seriously. Cantor’s latest attempt is to brand himself as a staunch critic of immigration reform efforts that passed the Senate last year but have stalled in the Republican-controlled House. According to reports, the GOP leader sent out a campaign mailer that claims Cantor is "stopping the (President Barack) Obama-(Sen. Harry) Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty." He went on to claim the "liberal plan would give six million illegal aliens citizenship." The timing of the flier is interesting; just last week, Cantor reaffirmed his support of a plan that would give citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants who enter the U.S. military. Some might call that amnesty. But let’s go back to the Senate plan and take a look at whether Cantor’s mailer is an accurate portrayal of the bill. Is it amnesty? We asked Cantor’s campaign to explain the language of the ad to us. They didn’t respond. Is it reasonable to call the Senate bill "amnesty"? In the past, we’ve said yes and no, generally settling on Half True. In addition to spending billions on new border control measures, the bill also seeks to address the status of the 11.5 million undocumented immigrants already residing in the United States. Some of those individuals would be eligible for a pathway to citizenship. In that respect, the bill does include an amnesty provision, because in legalese, the previous offense (in this case entering the country illegally) is eventually forgiven. But the path to citizenship is not without significant hurdles and the bill does not "give" away citizenship status, as Cantor portends in his campaign literature. For many people, it would take up to 13 years before they are legally citizens. And it’s not free, either. The bill would allow people to seek "Registered Provisional Immigrant Status," by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as "Dreamers," and some agricultural workers would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. New security measures would have to be underway before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. Is it Obama and Reid’s bill? Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid both support the Senate immigration bill. Reid voted for it, and Obama has called on the House to take up the legislation. But it’s a tough sell to pin the bill entirely to those two Democratic leaders, and by calling it a 'liberal" plan, Cantor conveniently leaves out that it had sizeable Republican backing. For starters, the bill is largely the product of the so-called "Gang of Eight," a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators who spent months working on the legislation before successfully ushering it through the upper chamber. Obama’s efforts were mostly behind the scenes. Perhaps the most significant addition to the Gang of Eight was Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who joined Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and added a critical conservative and Latino voice to the debate. Someone on the left could just as easily call it the Rubio-Graham plan. It's far more accurate to label it a bipartisan proposal. The four Republicans in the "gang" weren’t the bill’s only GOP supporters, either. When it passed 68 to 32 in June 2013, 14 Republicans eventually voted for it. The Democratic caucus supported it unanimously, supplying the other 54 votes. Still, that makes it about as bipartisan a measure as you’ll see pass out of the Senate on such a controversial topic these days. While many conservative groups have come out against the Senate bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a right-of-center organization, has backed the immigration reform efforts, as have faith-based groups that more often side with the GOP on social issues. That’s not to say it’s not a contentious or politically charged piece of legislation. But characterizing it Reid and Obama's liberal bill is a distortion of reality. Our ruling In recent campaign literature, Cantor said the Senate immigration bill is "liberal" and the "Obama-Reid plan to give illegal immigrants amnesty." Reasonable people might consider this amnesty, but it’s a much more rigorous path to citizenship than Cantor lets on in his flier. It’s certainly not a "give" away. Further, the plan had significant support from both sides of the aisle, both inside the Senate and from outside organizations. The bipartisan Gang of Eight is credited with putting together the package, not Obama and Reid. Weighing all of that, we think Cantor is intentionally misleading Virginia voters on this issue. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2014-05-28T18:01:39	2014-05-28	['None']
pomt-14552	Says Sen. Bernie Sanders has called President Barack Obama "weak. He's called him a disappointment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/12/hillary-clinton/did-bernie-sanders-call-president-barack-obama-wea/	In one of the more heated exchanges of the Democratic presidential debate in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders of having shown too little loyalty to President Barack Obama. Clinton said, "In the past, (Sanders) has called (Obama) weak. He’s called him a disappointment." For emphasis, she later repeated the charge that Sanders had used the words "weak" and "disappointment." But did he? We found lots of examples of Sanders prodding Obama to take a more aggressively liberal approach to governing, and we have previously found some truth to the charge that Sanders had tried to find someone to challenge Obama in a primary when he was running for a second term in 2012. But the specific charge Clinton made -- that Sanders used the words "weak" and "disappointment" -- were at best exaggerated. We found two examples when Sanders used one or both of those words, both of which are murkier than Clinton lets on. One is an interview Sanders gave broadcaster Thom Hartmann on July 22, 2011. Sanders lamented that Obama, in his view, had moved too far to the right politically. But while Sanders used the words Clinton cited, he didn’t say that he himself felt that way. Specifically, Sanders said, "I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been — for whatever reason — in negotiating with Republicans. And there’s deep disappointment." Note Sanders’ language: He says "millions of Americans" feel that way, not that he did so himself. It’s a small difference, but we think a significant one given the forcefulness of Clinton’s attack line. The other example we found came on Nov. 13, 2011, when Politico reported that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama for re-election (though he ultimately did). The Politico article quoted Sanders saying that Obama should "stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it’s a little bit early in the process." Here, Sanders said Obama had reached weak agreements with his political adversaries, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Once again, this is more nuanced than Clinton’s assertion made it out to be. We should note that Sanders has used other words to distance himself from Obama’s policies and approach to governing. For instance, in July 2015, Sanders told Jim Tankersley, a writer for the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, "In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he’s wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I’ll go from here on my own. I’ll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don’t need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized." This is certainly a critical assessment of Obama’s tenure, but it doesn’t include the words "weak" or "disappointment." Our ruling Clinton said Sanders has called Obama "weak. He's called him a disappointment." Sanders has critiqued Obama and used those words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama’s policies. But Sanders did not specifically call Obama "weak" and "a disappointment." We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-15060	"#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2015/sep/25/caleb-rowden/columbia-lawmaker-says-mizzou-broke-obamacare-law-/	After the University of Missouri-Columbia announced on Aug. 14 it would pull subsidies for graduate student health insurance plans, several Missouri politicians turned to Twitter to express their disapproval. Rep. Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, blamed the Affordable Care Act for MU’s decision. "#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing," Rowden tweeted Aug. 21. MU cited an IRS decision based on the Affordable Care Act as the reason for pulling insurance subsidies for graduate students, who are considered university employees. The university said it would be subject to an excise tax of $36,500 per year per student employee if it continued its subsidies program, which was specifically designed to help graduate students pay for health insurance. To make up for the subsidies, MU announced it would give a one-time fellowship to all eligible graduate students. By law, the university couldn’t tell students the fellowships funds had to be used to purchase health insurance. On Aug. 21, after significant student pressure, MU announced it would "defer implementation of its decision regarding graduate student health insurance," according to a letter by MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. In other words, the university reinstated graduate student health insurance subsidies — at least for the time being. Even after the university restored the subsidies, it wasn’t clear if MU’s initial withdrawal of the funds could be blamed on the Affordable Care Act, or if MU had actually broken the law by reinstating the benefits. We decided to take a look. ‘#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare’ MU student employees aren’t eligible for the group health plan the university offers to other workers. And, unlike other universities, MU doesn’t provide a student group health insurance plan. Instead, students — graduate and undergraduate — can opt to sign up for an individual health plan offered through Aetna Health. Some graduate students are eligible to receive subsidies from MU to pay for their insurance, according to the MU Office of Graduate Studies website. To get the money, graduate students have to sign up for a student individual health plan provided by Aetna. Then, students must email the Office of Graduate Studies, which verifies enrollment in the plan and eligibility for subsidies. Students then receive a reimbursement for the insurance plan’s partial or total cost. Subsidy levels depend on, among other factors, the number of hours students work per week. By asking students to enroll in an individual health plan to receive money, MU requires its student employees to use the subsidies to purchase insurance, said Sidney Watson, a health law professor at St. Louis University School of Law. That’s a big no-no, according to IRS regulations created to enforce the Affordable Care Act. According to the IRS, employers are allowed to give money to their employees that could go toward purchasing individual health insurance. But employers can’t require workers to use the cash specifically for that purpose, Watson said. To comply with the health care law, employers can provide subsidies — and require that the money be used to purchase health insurance — only to employees enrolled in a group plans. And as we said, MU graduate students aren’t part of a group health plan. Hence the problem. In July, MU realized the potential implications of not complying with the law. The university pulled the subsidies to avoid penalties and legal trouble. Technically speaking, MU’s withdrawal of health insurance subsidies for graduate students is "the result of the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act by the Treasury Department, because the Affordable Care Act itself doesn’t address this question," said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University. So, it’s not just the Affordable Care Act that caused the problem. But, the idea that the removal of benefits is a "direct result of" the Affordable Care Act isn’t too far from reality. Absent the Affordable Care Act, Jost said, it’s likely MU would still be able to legally provide subsidies for graduate students to purchase individual health plans. "The basic problem with the statement is that it greatly oversimplifies a very complicated situation," Jost said. ‘#MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing’ By "the right thing," Rowden meant "give graduate students health insurance," Rowden’s legislative assistant Stuart Murray told PolitiFact Missouri. By that measure it’s not correct to say MU broke the law, several experts who spoke to PolitiFact Missouri said. "The university has other options; they do NOT have to break the law," said Gerald Kominski, a professor of health policy and management at University of California Los Angeles, in an email interview. MU could dodge legal trouble by adopting UCLA’s model, Kominski said. Health insurance is a mandatory for all UCLA students and it’s a condition of enrollment, according to the university’s website. UCLA automatically signs up all students in a student group health plan, which they’re all then billed for. This effectively requires all graduate students who’ve received increased stipends to use the money to pay for insurance unless they can prove they have insurance from another source, Kominski said. Jost, the Washington and Lee law professor, came up with another alternative. "(MU) could simply add (graduate students) to its employer plan as employees and give them employee coverage," he said. A comprehensive student group health plan would also solve the issue, said Philip G. Peters, Jr., MU health law professor emeritus. He also said this solution would be expensive for MU. The university’s original solution — providing stipends to all students that weren’t specifically earmarked for health insurance — was also within the framework of the law, said Watson, the SLU law professor. Overall, the experts we spoke to offered at least five alternatives to the graduate health insurance ordeal. On balance, "Rep. Rowden is partially correct and partially very wrong," Peters said. Our ruling Rowden tweeted: "#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing." Without the Affordable Care Act, MU wouldn’t have had to remove subsidies for graduate students. But MU can still provide health insurance for its student employees — all without breaking the law. The university could, for example, create a student group health plan for graduate its graduate student employees. The first part of Rowden’s tweet is accurate but takes things out context. The second part of the statement isn’t accurate. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Caleb Rowden	None	None	None	2015-09-25T13:33:33	2015-08-21	['None']
pomt-15044	The unemployment rate may be as high as "42 percent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-unemployment-rate-may-be-42-perc/	During the televised press conference in which he announced his tax plan, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump returned to a claim he has made before -- that the official unemployment rate -- currently 5.1 percent -- woefully undercounts the percentage of people who are unemployed. During the Sept. 28, 2015, media event, Trump described an unemployment rate in the range of 5 percent as "such a phony number." "The number isn't reflective," he said. "I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent." He continued, "5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent." We previously rated False a claim by Trump that "our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent." So if 18 to 20 percent is false, how does 42 percent rate? We took a closer look. We’ll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population. Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work. This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements. The 42% calculation We asked the Trump campaign for a source of the 42 percent figure, but they didn’t respond. The Fact Checker, however, traced it back to a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a "plausible measure of the potential workforce." If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you run the numbers, "the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent," Stockman wrote. Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws. In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so. "Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers," he wrote. "We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else." Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial. Stockman’s calculation "treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all." In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced. Taking another whack at the numbers All of this spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It’s within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor "underutilization" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially "unemployed" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are "marginally attached" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump’s 42 percent. We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here’s a summary. Category People Neither working nor officially unemployed, age 16 and up, civilians and noninstitutionalized only 94.0 million Subtract: Ages 16 to 19 9.7 million Subtract: Ages 65 and over 37.8 million Subtract: Students, age 20 to 24 8.7 million Subtract: Students, age 25 to 29 2.9 million Subtract: Students, age 30 to 34 1.4 million Subtract: Stay-at-home moms 10.3 million Subtract: Stay-at-home dads 2.0 million Subtract: Those receiving disability checks 9.0 million Subtract: Those in job training, ages 24 to 29 745,000 (estimate) Remainder: 11.5 million In other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early). If you turn this into a new type of "unemployment" rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it’s only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed. As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being "out of work" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. "The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits," he said. This isn't the first time Trump has used the 42 percent number. In August, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the column’s harshest rating for truthfulness. Trump then repeated it in his tax-plan press conference. Our ruling Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump’s 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire. CORRECTION, Feb. 11, 2016: We've updated this story to reflect some changes to the statistics for students listed in the table. Our new calculation puts the highest "unemployment" rate we could produce at 16.4 percent. The rating remains Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1b7360a0-5e27-41f2-a541-c0e476663219	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-09-30T10:00:00	2015-09-28	['None']
pomt-05779	After prenatal diagnosis, "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-90-percent-down-syndrome-childr/	During an interview on CBS News' Face the Nation on Feb. 19, 2012, Rick Santorum got into a lengthy discussion of prenatal issues with host Bob Schieffer. We’re looking at two claims from that exchange; but here we’re focusing on here is that "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." Let’s first look at the context of Santorum’s claim. Referring to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio, Schieffer said, "You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all." Santorum responded, "Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." First, let’s recap what PolitiFact Florida found when it checked a similar claim in April 2011 that came up during a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives. Republican state Rep. Richard Corcoran said -- and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates publicized it on Twitter -- that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." Corcoran cited a New York Times article from 2007 that discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that "about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion." The story did not say specifically where the statistic came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. We searched and found other studies that showed similar percentages. A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. A study in San Francisco published in 2006 found an overall rate of 81 percent. That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here). However, in additional research for this article, we’ve found information that makes the question less cut-and-dried. In a joint statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups cautioned against generalizing about national patterns from a series of smaller, local studies. "No current, comprehensive estimate of the number of pregnancy terminations following prenatal diagnosis exists," the statement said. "Several studies reporting older data, studies from single centers and studies from other countries have reflected variation in the number of pregnancies terminated. These studies are frequently cited, but given their limitations, are difficult to generalize to the current population of pregnant women in the United States. Undocumented observations from prenatal genetic counselors in the United States suggest that the rate of termination for prenatally diagnosed Down syndrome may vary across the country. New research is called for to comprehensively explore the uptake of prenatal testing and the outcomes of prenatally diagnosed pregnancies in order to more accurately define how women currently incorporate prenatal testing into their lives." ACOG suggested we talk to Mark I. Evans, a physician and president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. He emphasized that the percentage can vary significantly based on region and other factors. "In liberal areas such as New York City, probably 80 to 90 percent of patients with severe abnormalties do choose to terminate when legal to do so," Evans said. "In conservative areas, the proportion of terminations is much lower, perhaps as little as 10 percent" in some cases. We also located a paper in the journal Issues in Law & Medicine, titled "Informed Consent or Institutionalized Eugenics? How the Medical Profession Encourages Abortion of Fetuses with Down Syndrome." The paper cites the example of a professor and practitioner, Elizabeth Gettig, who found that "almost 100 percent" of women with a Down syndrome diagnosis chose to abort when she practiced in North Carolina, but the number dropped to about half when she relocated to Pittsburgh. Gettig offered several reasons for the disparity. "First, the Pittsburgh region has a higher percentage of Catholics," the paper said. "Second, there are more services than most cities in Pittsburgh to assist children who have disabilities." Our ruling A number of scientific studies have shown an abortion rate from 80 percent to 90 percent -- close to what Santorum said -- but all have been localized. Since there’s evidence that the decision to abort can vary by region, we think it’s an overstatement for Santorum to say that after prenatal diagnosis, "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." There are no standardized, national numbers, so his use of the term "in America" is problematic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.

According to a New York Times account of her speech, Clinton said young Texans had been disenfranchised by the voter ID law. "If you want to vote in this state," she said, "you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough." This claim took just a few key strokes and help from a state office to confirm. Prior to the change in law, Texas law didn’t require anyone to present a photo ID to vote. However, Alicia Phillips Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, confirmed by email that student ID’s previously could have been presented to help officials pin down someone’s identity for the purposes of voting though the law did not require anyone to present more than a voter registration card. The old law broadly said a voter could present a "form of identification containing the person’s photograph that establishes the person’s identity." The Texas secretary of state’s office says on its Frequently Asked Questions web page that the current ID mandate enables a registered voter to cast a ballot at a poll during early voting or on Election Day with one of seven types of a photo ID: A Texas driver license issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Texas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS. Texas personal identification card issued by DPS. Texas concealed handgun license issued by DPS. U.S. military identification card containing the person’s photograph. U.S. citizenship certificate containing the person’s photograph. U.S. passport. So, yes to voting in Texas with a concealed handgun license but no-go for someone presenting a student ID. Nationally, the National Conference of State Legislatures said in March 2015, 14 of 34 states with laws requiring voters to show identification at the polls included a student ID option, including three states — Mississippi, Virginia and Wisconsin — that, like Texas, were described by the group as having "strict" photo ID voting laws. Wondering if a student ID element was ever part of the legislation that became the Texas law, we reviewed the varied versions of Senate Bill 14, authored by Sen. Troy Fraser of Horseshoe Bay and fellow Republicans that advanced in the 2011 legislative session. We found no "student" mentions. Language permitting a state license to carry a concealed handgun to be offered at the polls wasn’t in the original Fraser proposal; it was added, though, before the Senate sent the proposal to the House, legislative records show. Voting by mail We’ve noted before that Texas maintains a no-ID element for voting by mail, in 2013 rating True a claim the Texas law doesn’t require a person voting by mail to present a photo ID. That’s so, we found, for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Those voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even they don’t have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas. A registered voter wishing to ballot by mail must say she or he will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or she or he is sick or disabled or will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote. Our ruling Clinton said: "If you want to vote in" Texas, "you can use a concealed-weapon permit as a valid form of identification, but a valid student ID isn’t good enough." The photo IDs accepted at Texas polling places include the state’s concealed-handgun license and not any student IDs. We rate this statement True.

pomt-02098	"Economic inequality in Multnomah County has a face -- and a name. It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/may/16/jim-francesconi/does-multnomah-county-have-90000-people-who-are-un/	Income inequality is a hot topic both nationally and in Multnomah County, where Jim Francesconi has made it a central theme in his race against Deborah Kafoury and four other candidates for chair of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners. Using campaign themes of "Moving Forward Together" and "Leaving No One Behind," Francesconi has said he will focus heavily on job creation if elected. The claim: Francesconi’s campaign website describes him as a "champion of workers’ rights" and highlights a jobs plan. It also includes the claim that the county is still recovering from the Great Recession. "Economic inequality in Multnomah County has a face -- and a name," according to one item. "It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash." Does Multnomah County have 90,000 residents who are unemployed or underemployed? We checked. The analysis: We contacted Francesconi’s campaign and asked about the statistic. They sent an email containing several sources, including the annual and quarterly reports of a nonprofit agency that tracks employment data and a link to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics table showing "underutilized" labor for every state. However, the crux of his claim was contained in a news article that put county unemployment at 91,600 as of March 2013. We checked that by calling Amy Vander Vliet, a regional economist with the Oregon Employment Department. Her department is responsible for compiling and publishing the state’s official employment numbers. The correct figure for Multnomah County unemployment at the time Francesconi’s campaign published its claim, she said, is 27,800. The 91,600 figure, she said, appears to come from a category labeled "Portland Metro" unemployment in a report issued by Worksystems, a nonprofit agency that deals with employment in Multnomah and Washington counties. The greater Portland metro area, for the agency’s reporting purposes, is comprised of seven counties, including Multnomah. We then checked the campaign’s other sources -- Worksystems’ annual State of the Workforce and its quarterly report, issued in October 2013. We checked both. The annual report did not mention "underemployment." Vander Vliet verified that. The quarterly report, which included data through the end of September 2013, said a combined 68,000 people in Washington and Multnomah counties were underemployed as of that time. Vander Vliet said she could not vouch for the figure because her department doesn’t provide county-by-county information tracking underemployment. We called Rick McKay, senior project manager at Worksystems, who came up with the 68,000 figure. He said it’s based on a sampling of telephone interviews his agency conducts. "It’s a back-of-the-envelope kind of number," he said. "But it’s somewhere in that neighborhood." McKay estimated that about 60 percent of the 68,000 underemployed people live in Multnomah County. That would put the figure at 40,800. Clearly, that number isn’t statistically valid, but if added to the 27,800 people who are unemployed in the county, we get 68,600 people who are either unemployed or underemployed in Multnomah County. That’s considerably shy of the 90,000 figure on Francesconi’s campaign website. We asked the campaign about the discrepancy and received in reply a spreadsheet showing the number of people living below the federal poverty line in every county in the country. The numbers, taken from federal statistics, put the figure at 136,065 for Multnomah County. However, those numbers don’t take into account that many of those people, even if at or near the federal poverty level, are employed. In addition, federal poverty statistics have nothing to do with any of the sources the campaign originally provided. Our ruling: Jim Francesconi, now running for Multnomah County chair, says on his campaign website that 90,000 people in the county are either unemployed or underemployed in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash. His campaign, when asked, pointed to several sources to justify the number. One source, which the campaign could have verified, gave an incorrect figure for the number of unemployed workers in the county. Another, contrary to what the campaign asserted, made no mention of underemployed workers. A third cited a figure for underemployment, but the person who compiled the figure acknowledged it was an "estimate on an estimate." Taking that estimate and adding it to the number of unemployed in the county gives us a figure of 68,600 -- a lot, obviously, but far short of the 90,000 listed by Francesconi. We rate the claim False.	None	Jim Francesconi	None	None	None	2014-05-16T17:08:02	2014-04-15	['None']
pomt-03200	The 2010 DREAM Act failed despite "strong bipartisan support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/28/janet-napolitano/2010-dream-act-has-strong-bipartisan-support-said-/	Janet Napolitano is set to leave her post as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security after serving for President Barack Obama’s entire first term and into his second. But before leaving, she issued a ringing defense of Obama administration policies, especially when it came to immigration. Napolitano singled out the how the administration has handled young illegal immigrants who were brought as children to the United States. Under Obama’s policies, these young people have been allowed to stay, at least for the time being, under a policy called referred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama authorized the policy after Congress failed to pass legislation called the DREAM Act that would have achieved the same thing on a permanent basis. Napolitano suggested the administration’s hand was forced due to congressional gridlock. "Congress had a chance to give the so-called dreamers a way to stay in our country through the DREAM Act but, unfortunately, that legislation failed to garner the 60 votes need for cloture, falling just five votes short despite strong bipartisan support," she said. (Napolitano is set to leave her post on Sept. 6, 2013, to lead the University of California system.) Her comments got our attention. We didn’t remember strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for the DREAM Act. That sent us looking up congressional votes to see what the vote was. On Dec. 18, 2010, the DREAM Act failed on a cloture vote, where 60 votes are needed to advance the bill. The vote ended up 55 in favor and 41 opposed, with four senators not voting. Among those in favor, the vote included 50 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents. (The three Republicans were Robert Bennett of Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Only Murkowski still serves.) Among those opposed, the vote included 36 Republicans and five Democrats. There’s some bipartisanship there, but not much. At PolitiFact, we usually describe such votes as failing "largely along partisan lines." And in fact, the 2010 DREAM Act vote stands in contrast to more recent Senate votes -- which had much more bipartisan support. The farm bill, for example, passed the Senate 66-27 on June 10, 2013, with 46 Democratic votes, 18 Republican votes and two independents. The comprehensive immigration bill to overhaul the entire immigration system, including the DREAM Act, passed on a 68-32 vote, with 52 Democratic votes, 14 Republican votes and two independents. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare the relative bipartisanship of the DREAM Act votes with other votes. We set this benchmark: A bill receiving half its support from Democrats and half its support from Republicans would be considered 100 percent bipartisan, which would be a very strong showing of bipartisanship. (There are other ways we could calculate this, but this seemed simple and fair.) Using that measure as a yardstick, the 2010 DREAM Act vote was 6 percent bipartisan. Meanwhile, the 2013 farm bill was 28 percent bipartisan, and this year’s comprehensive immigration bill was 21 percent bipartisan. Napolitano said that bipartisan support for the DREAM Act was "strong." Actually, the DREAM Act seems a rather weak display of bipartisanship. (We asked for comment from DHS, but we didn’t hear back.) We should note that we’ve looked closely at the question of what makes a bill bipartisan before. In 2009, Obama claimed that a Senate committee approved a version of the health care law with "both Democratic and Republican support." We rated that Mostly False, since it got a single Republican vote out of 14 votes in favor. In 2011, we looked at House Speaker John Boehner’s statement that the House’s "cut, cap and balance" budget plan passed the chamber with "bipartisan support." We rated that Mostly False, the proposal got five Democratic votes out of 234 in favor. We noted in that report that there is a proud tradition of claiming that a vote is bipartisan, even when it has the barest sliver of votes from the other party. This tradition is -- dare we say it -- bipartisan. But that doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Our ruling Napolitano said that the DREAM Act -- a law that would have allowed young people in the United States illegally to stay -- failed in Congress even though it had "strong bipartisan support." We looked up the vote and found that three Republican senators joined 52 other senators on the vote. The bill failed because it required 60 votes. Three Republican senators isn’t "strong" bipartisan support, though. In fact, it’s pretty minimal. The vote failed largely along partisan lines. Napolitano’s remarks clearly suggest otherwise. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Janet Napolitano	None	None	None	2013-08-28T12:04:43	2013-08-27	['None']
pomt-06336	Obama creates new tax on Christmas trees, fees get passed on to consumers.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/09/blog-posting/republicans-bloggers-needle-obama-creating-new-tax/	In Oregon, fresh cut Christmas trees are as cherished as hazelnuts and Hood strawberries: We grow a lot of them, so we own them. So it was with some astonishment that PolitiFact Oregon heard that President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy holiday trees. "Is President Obama 'the Grinch who taxed Christmas' trees?" queried a headline on the Los Angeles Times website. A Republican congressman from Louisiana issued a press release, slamming the Democratic president for trying to "sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees." By the end of Nov. 9, 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation had logged more than 2,000 comments on its blog post, "Obama Couldn’t Wait: His New Christmas Tree Tax." Locally, we spotted a Multnomah County GOP retweet of the Republican National Committee: "Obama admin creates new tax on Christmas tree farms, fees get passed onto the consumer." What in the name of Rudolph and Frosty and the Polar Express was going on? Oregon is the No. 1 grower of Christmas firs and pine, harvesting more than 7 million trees. (That’s twice the haul of No. 2 North Carolina.) Was the president seriously imposing a new "tax" that might make our holidays a little less ho-ho-ho? As it happens, a national fresh tree group had sought the 15-cent tree assessment to better promote its products. It’s a "checkoff program"much like the ones already in place for beef ("it’s what’s for dinner")and pork ("the other white meat"). The Agriculture Department approved the idea. The Internet exploded. By the end of the day, the White House had decided to re-assess. Betty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who heads up the Christmas Tree Promotion Now campaign, said she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by the president. "It’s absurd. We’ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years. The industry has talked about this for 20 years," Malone said. "This started long before Obama" was in the White House. To be fair, not everyone in the industry embraces the idea, although the National Christmas Tree Association reports the majority of responses to the proposed program were positive. Would the fee be passed on to consumers? That’s unclear, said Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association. "It doesn’t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it." Finally, there’s the question of whether the 15-cent assessment is actually a "tax." The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn’t go to government. Rick Dungey, spokesman for the national tree association, insists it is not a tax. (He also says consumers should not see a difference in tree prices.) In Oregon, at least, revenue has to go into the general treasury in order to be considered a tax. If the government doesn’t touch the money, even though government mandates it, the assessment is neither a tax nor a fee. But we digress. We’re talking about the federal government. Let’s turn to federal sources, with the help of national PolitiFact. "It certainly doesn't smell or quack like a tax," said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton. On the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the Cato Institute, says "a coercive levy is a tax." We also checked with Stephen Bell, communications director for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana congressman who vowed to block Obama’s sneaky tree tax, and Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman. It didn’t matter to either of them that industry had sought the assessment or that industry was denying it’s a tax. "It doesn’t matter who asked for it," said Bell. "It’s at the sole discretion of the Obama administration to impose a tax, and they decided to impose this 15-cent tree tax." This is a tax, added Spicer, because "it’s not voluntary. It’s not a contribution to a cause." So, where does that leave us? Sources appear split on whether this truly is a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. As for the claim that Obama created this new tax, that suggests that he came up with the program -- when it’s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry. Those are pretty big facts to ignore. So we rate the claim Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-07228	"We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George Bush left office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/02/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-says-george-w-bush-inherited-56-trilli/	During an interview on the MSNBC show The Daily Rundown, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., addressed the previous day’s House vote to raise the debt ceiling. Hoyer blamed Republicans for turning the vote -- which failed by a wide margin -- into a political game. The "premise" of the debt ceiling vote, Hoyer said, "was we have this debt because of President (Barack) Obama's policies. That's simply not true, and the world knows it's not true, and the Republicans know it's not true. We went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus trillion debt when George (W.) Bush left office. So to say it is Obama's debt and that the debt limit needs to be extended because of Obama is simply not true." A reader asked us to check Hoyer’s claim that the United States "went from a $5.6 trillion surplus that George Bush inherited to over ... $11-plus-trillion debt when George Bush left office." Here’s the way we initially looked at it. We turned to a historical table published annually by the Office of Management and Budget. The table reports that during fiscal year 2001 -- which included much of Bush’s first year in office, and which was based on a budget assembled during the term of his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton -- there was a surplus of $128 billion. So Hoyer was right that there was a surplus, but it was only 2 percent of the amount Hoyer indicated it was. Meanwhile, according to the Treasury Department, the level of debt when Bush left office on Jan. 20, 2009, was either $6.307 trillion (the amount of debt held by the public) or $10.627 trillion (the amount of publicly held debt plus debt held by the government, including the Social Security and Medicare trust funds). With the latter measure, Hoyer’s in the ballpark. But when we spoke to Hoyer’s office, they said he was actually using a different yardstick for the first figure. They said Hoyer was referring to the $5.61 trillion in surpluses that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress -- had predicted in January 2001 would materialize over the next 10 years, based on the fiscal outlook at the end of Clinton’s tenure. (Hoyer’s office confirmed our conclusion about the second figure.) The CBO number provides support for Hoyer’s claim, but we think that his failure to make clear that he was comparing a projected surplus to the deficit weaken his argument. Given Hoyer’s wording -- that when Bush came into office he "inherited" a $5.6 trillion surplus, we think a viewer would assume that it’s both a tangible figure, and that it refers to a specific point in time. In reality, it’s neither. It’s a projection of future surpluses, and it’s a figure that covers a 10-year period. In fact, the final two years of those surpluses wouldn’t even fall within Bush’s two terms in office. There is some merit in Hoyer’s larger point -- that Bush came into office with a rosy fiscal outlook and left with one that was far less so. And he’s pretty close when he says that Bush left an "$11-plus trillion debt" when he departed the Oval Office. Still, Hoyer left out enough qualifiers -- that the number was a projection, and that it covered 10 years -- that we believe viewers would take away an exaggerated impression of the fiscal picture Bush inherited. So we’re giving Hoyer’s comment a rating of Half True.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2011-06-02T11:41:34	2011-06-01	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-14568	"Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)"	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/09/viral-image/no-evidence-support-rumors-tying-zika-genetically-/	Global health emergencies understandably stoke fear, panic and wild claims. Exaggerations about Ebola were PolitiFact’s 2014 Lie of the Year. And now rumors about Zika, a virus linked to birth defects, are taking the Internet by storm. One of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control. As Snopes and Discover have noted, this idea appears to have originated from a post published Jan. 25 to the subreddit r/conspiracy — our first red flag. But since then, the claim has been circulated by media outlets ranging from Infowars and Natural News to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Russia Today and Fox News. One version can be found in a popular YouTube video entitled: "Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic) funded by Gates." The video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, "where we have this explosion of Zika," the video says. "Writing’s on the wall, folks." We wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes. In a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn’t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn’t hold up. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes. "I don’t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission," said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. "I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue," said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University. Let’s dissect this claim bit by bit. Not a new disease The claim’s first problem is history. Zika didn’t suddenly appear after genetically modified mosquitoes were released. The virus was first documented nearly seven decades ago in Uganda and has cropped up many times over the years. On April 18, 1947, researchers studying jungle yellow fever isolated the virus from mosquitoes and named it after the Zika Forest where it was found. Though Zika had never been seen before, "it had probably lurked chronically in African monkeys, or some other native reservoir, for millennia," reports National Geographic. In the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented. Zika was detected outside of the two continents for the first time in 2007. The small island nation of Yap saw 108 confirmed or probable cases of the disease. The second outbreak of Zika hit French Polynesia, another small island in the Pacific, in 2013. About 11 percent of the population (28,000 cases) were infected. In May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby’s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America. Incapable mosquitoes The claim’s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn’t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak. Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. This particular mosquito, common in tropical areas around the world, also spreads yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya. To combat dengue fever, Oxitec engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce a lethal protein and self-destruct. Females, which bite, are destroyed in the lab while males, which don’t bite and thus can’t transmit diseases, are released into the wild. They mate with local, non-GM females and the self-destruct gene is passed onto offspring. Oxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release. "This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive," said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. "Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika." Wrong location The claim’s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn’t actually match up. The first Brazilian cases of Zika reported in May 2015 were in Camaçari, a district in the northeastern state of Bahia that’s hundreds of kilometers away from the Oxitec trial sites. The biotech firm released the genetically modified mosquitoes in Juazeiro, which is roughly 490 kilometers from Camaçari, and in Jacobina, about 340 kilometers away. It’s also very unlikely, if not impossible, that Zika-carrying Oxitec mosquitoes made their way to Camaçari. For one, the typical Aedes aegypti mosquito can fly a maximum of 200 meters to 440 meters. For another, the trials took place months and years before the Camaçari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So "even if an Oxitec mosquito ‘hitched a lift,’ " it would have died long before, Warren said. Beginning in April 2015, Oxitec did release mosquitoes in Piracicaba, in the southeastern state of São Paulo — about 2,000 kilometers from Camaçari and 1,900 kilometers from the epicenter of the disease in Recife. According to the state’s department of health, São Paulo has reported only 20 cases of microcephaly as of Jan. 20, 2016 (though there is some suspicion over the official tally) while Piracicaba itself has two confirmed and 12 suspected cases of Zika. Oxitec’s true role in Zika’s rapid spread Rather than spreading Zika, Oxitec mosquitoes could actually help fight the disease, as NPR, CNN, and the New York Times have noted. The self-destructing bugs have reduced virus-carrying mosquito populations in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands by 80 to 90 percent, according to studies commissioned by the company. (Critics say these results are exaggerated.) Experts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos. Whereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil. Immunity and resistance to the disease has been documented in Nigeria and Indonesia. But in the Americas, Zika is basically a "virgin soil epidemic," said Morse of Columbia. (So were smallpox to Native American populations in the United States and yellow fever to European colonialists in West Africa.) "I think it’s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we’ve seen this kind of thing happen many times," Morse said. One final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is helping support PolitiFact’s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has no input over what we fact-check or the rulings we issue. Our ruling An Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the "Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)." There’s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered — where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released — doesn’t hold up. What’s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses. This claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12129	"The idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/15/joy-reid/did-confederate-symbols-gain-prominence-civil-righ/	A major catalyst in the run up to the deadly clashes in Charlottesville, Va., was the city’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. As the nation reeled from the violence, some political analysts sought to place Confederate symbolism in a broader historical context to help explain the turmoil around the Aug. 11-12 weekend. "The idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s," MSNBC analyst Joy Reid said on NBC’s Meet The Press, Aug. 13, 2017. Reid went on to say that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African-Americans. American history features two periods when Confederate symbolism spiked: around the turn of the 20th century and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s. As a group, most Confederate statues went up in the earlier period. Early 20th century: Confederate monuments multiply A sharp uptick in the construction of Confederate monuments took place from the late 1890s up to about 1920. That’s according to a Southern Poverty Law Center study that took a nationwide inventory of the more than 1,500 Confederate symbols in public spaces. This chart from the study shows the increased pace of construction around the turn of the 20th century, with blue dots signifying monuments on courthouse grounds, red dots indicating other sites (including monuments) and green dots representing schools. Several cross-currents explain the explosion of Confederate symbolism in this period. This was an era of generational change during which Civil War veterans, dying of old age, were venerated by their children and grandchildren, experts told us. "Organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans came into being," said Charles S. Bullock, III, a professor of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia. "Civil War veterans were honored in parades. There is a Confederate Memorial Day which pre-dates the National Memorial Day." But as a victorious North fixed its gaze on a prosperous future, the American South was mired in poverty that would persist for generations. The monuments were a way to look back to an idealized past. "Tributes to the Confederacy — placing statues, naming streets and other public facilities — were part of the Lost Cause ideology that focused on an idyllic era of stately mansions, beautiful women and gallant Confederate officers," Bullock said. But the monuments also implicitly symbolized slavery and white violence, the experts said. "On the surface, they were memorials to the Confederacy and their heroes," said Karen L. Cox, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. "Yet, they were also built during a period of racial violence and strong beliefs about Anglo-Saxon (i.e. white) supremacy." "The fact that they were placed on the grounds of county and state courthouses was intentional," she added. "The message: white men are in charge." The period between 1890-World War I saw whites reassert control over the South by enforcing Jim Crow laws, taking control of southern governments and systematically disenfranchising and disempowering African-Americans, said Jonathan Leib, a professor of geography and chair of the department of political science and geography at Old Dominion University. Racial segregation also got a major endorsement at the federal level during this era. In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Plessy vs. Ferguson which upheld the constitutionality of state laws that racially segregated public facilities that were "separate but equal." (Nearly 60 years passed before the Court would declare such segregation "inherently unequal.") "This was also a moment when the nation itself began to repair the wounds of the late war by agreeing on the inferiority of African Americans," said Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School. "Racial segregation became the law and custom of the nation at precisely the moment when many of these monuments were built." Another monument born roughly of this era, a statue of Robert E. Lee installed in Charlottesville in 1924, now figures as a present-day flashpoint. Civil rights era: Confederate flag gains prominence The second period when Confederate symbols exploded was the civil rights era. But it was the Confederate flag — not monuments — that gained prominence during this time, as Reid later clarified in an email to PolitiFact and in a Aug. 15 appearance on MSNBC. The flag became a symbol of opposition to desegregation. "It was the choice to fly Confederate flags, more so than the building of new statues, on government property that became a popular show of resistance during the civil rights era," Muhammad said. He added the decision to fly the flag was a clear sign of protest against the federal government’s growing enforcement of civil rights. It was during this era when the Ku Klux Klan came to embrace the Confederate flag, notes the Southern Poverty Law Center. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Reid said, "the idea of putting up (Confederate) monuments actually didn’t happen right after the Civil War. It happened during the 1960s." She added that Confederate symbols were political statements aimed at African-Americans. Reid's comment that Confederate symbols are political statements aimed at African-Americans is backed up by history, say experts. But she is wrong that Confederate monuments were built during the civil rights era. Roughly 75 percent were erected before then, according to a comprehensive study of Confederate symbolism. It was during the civil rights era that the Confederate flag gained prominence, which she later clarified. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-15010	Says Donald Trump "supports eminent domain" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/07/club-growth/trump-supports-eminent-domain-abuse-says-conservat/	Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain. Eminent domain is the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision. "The Supreme Court’s Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations," the ad’s narrator says. "Conservatives have fought this disaster. What’s Donald Trump say about the decision?" The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. "I happen to agree with it 100 percent," Trump said. The narration picks back up: "Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights." Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as "eminent domain abuse" -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion. Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didn’t want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the government’s eminent domain powers. In a liberal majority 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found in New London’s favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growth’s ad. Here’s an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Fox’s Neil Cavuto: Cavuto: "What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision?" Trump: "Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, ‘Will Donald Trump take over your home?’ sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in. "But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good." As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property. In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jersey’s casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later. So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid 2000s, but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Fox’s Bret Baier asked Trump, "What do you think of eminent domain?" "I think eminent domain is wonderful," Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows "better than anybody" how frustrating it can be when you’re building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell. "And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory," he said. "I think eminent domain is fine." Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives. "I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject," Trump said. "I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives." Our ruling Club for Growth said "Trump supports eminent domain" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision. As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the Kelo decision, which expanded the power, "100 percent."

pomt-12518	"More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/apr/25/brad-schneider/are-there-three-times-many-solar-energy-jobs-coal-/	As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump has championed the cause of coal mining. But critics of the coal industry have countered that Trump and other supporters of coal are overlooking an energy sector with an even bigger impact on jobs -- solar energy. In a Chicago Tribune op-ed published on April 20 -- two days before Earth Day -- Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., took issue with Trump’s environmental priorities. At one point in the op-ed, he wrote, "More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry." We had previously looked at whether there are more people employed in the U.S. solar-energy industry than in the oil industry. (There aren’t.) But the comparison with the coal industry was new to us, so we decided to take a look. The sources of Schneider’s statistics When we contacted Schneider’s office, they cited two sources, one for each number in the statement. The first number -- 260,000 U.S. solar workers -- stems from the 2016 edition of the National Solar Jobs Census, which is published by the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit organization aligned with the solar industry. We confirmed that, according to the foundation’s calculations, there were 260,077 solar workers in the United States in 2016. The second number -- unstated in the op-ed, but equaling 87,000 workers employed in coal mining, if you do the math -- actually overstates the number of mine workers. According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the federal Energy Department, the number of people working at coal mines was 65,971 in 2016. The actual ratio between the two numbers would be almost four-to-one. So the congressman has some support for his statement. However, the comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Let’s explore why. Comparing data for energy jobs is tricky One problem for Schneider’s numerical comparison is that it uses different databases, with different methodologies. The Solar Foundation told us that their data comes from more than 500,000 telephone calls and more than 60,000 emails to known and potential energy establishments across the United States, resulting in a total of 3,888 full responses. The group counted jobs held by a worker who spends at least 50 percent of his or her time on solar-related work. They included jobs in installation, manufacturing, sales, distribution, and project development, among other categories. The Energy Information Administration data, meanwhile, comes from official U.S. Labor Department data. It includes employees "engaged in production, preparation, processing, development, maintenance, repair shop, or yard work at mining operations, including office workers." The coal industry considers the official coal employment numbers to be low "to the point of being fiction," said Terry Headley, a spokesman for the American Coal Council. "They don't include many people who work at a coal mine every day, full time, but are not company employees," Headley said. "They are employees of service companies that provide direct support services, such as coal truck drivers, electricians, surveyors, machinists, mechanics, construction workers and others. Taken together, despite everything that has been thrown at it, West Virginia alone has some 50,000 ‘coal miners and contractors’ according to the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training. If you go by the federal government data, West Virginia has only about 13,000 coal miners working." A better source While there will always be difficulties in making an exact comparison between the two energy sectors, there is a database well-suited for directly comparing solar and coal jobs. The United States Energy and Employment Report was designed by the Energy Information Association to put a variety of energy sectors on an equal statistical footing. This report found 373,087 solar jobs in 2016, compared to 160,119 coal jobs. (That’s a higher number for solar jobs than in the Solar Foundation report; it’s because the Energy Information Administration included jobs even if a relatively small proportion of the worker’s work week was spent on activities related to solar energy.) Here’s the full summary: This data produces a ratio of 2.3 solar jobs for every coal job. So by this measurement, there are more solar jobs than coal jobs, but it’s short of three times as high, as Schneider wrote. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and an expert in labor-force data, said she agreed that the U.S. Energy and Employment Report data is the best source to use. She added that other data from Indeed, where she is a senior economic fellow, bolsters the idea that the labor market is healthier for solar than for coal. "We saw almost eight times more solar job postings than coal job postings in the United States in the first quarter of 2017," Sinclair said. "Of course, these numbers don't represent current employment and are reflective of both growth and turnover in the different sectors. Still, it gives a sense of scale of these industries. This comparison leads me to think that Rep. Schneider's estimates may be on the conservative side looking forward." Our ruling Schneider said, "More than 260,000 Americans are employed by the domestic solar industry — three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry." Based on an apples-to-apples comparison using the best available data, the ratio is just short of three-to-one. Still, the data we found confirms that the number of solar-related jobs does outpace the number of coal-related jobs today. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10253	Biden is "one of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/howard-dean/we-should-all-be-so-poor/	Wealth has taken a beating in this presidential campaign as John McCain tries to paint Barack Obama as an elitist and Obama fires back that McCain is so rich he can't keep track of how many houses he owns. Now, it seems, a lack of wealth is the new political badge of honor. Just a day after Obama named Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean was on C-SPAN highlighting not only Biden's assets, but also his lack of assets, financially speaking. "Joe Biden has certainly been a good example of a working-class kid who grew up and got himself a scholarship to a great university, worked really hard and has really made good," Dean said. "One of the least wealthy members of the U.S. Senate, I think he remembers his roots and I think he'd tell you what a great country this is given his own experiences." Biden is the proverbial career politician. His main income is his salary as a U.S. senator. According to financial disclosure forms submitted on May 15, 2008, Biden's $165,200 salary as a senator in 2007 was supplemented with $20,500 he earned as an adjunct professor at Widener University Law School and a $112,500 advance he received from Random House for his book, Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics. Biden's financial picture gets a little fuzzier after that, because although each senator's financial disclosure statement includes assets, liabilities and earnings, the form does not require exact figures; instead, officials check off a range under which each item falls. So we know he has some income from several bank accounts, mutual funds and insurance policies. But he also lists liabilities including loans against cash value of life insurance policies, $15,001-$50,000; a loan he co-signed to pay for his son's college expenses, $15,001-$50,000; and a line of credit with the J. Wilmington Savings Fund Society for somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000. The Center for Responsive Politics analyzes the possible ranges of net worth among senators and in 2006 they determined that Biden's net worth was somewhere between negative $302,980 and $277,997. But keep in mind, you don't have to declare the value of your primary residence. Property records show that Biden's three-bedroom Wilmington, Del., home has an assessed value of $525,700. Still, in 2006, those disclosed numbers ranked Biden dead last among U.S. senators. "In the most recent rankings, 2006, he was the least wealthy, poorest I guess you could say, of the senators," said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. The center has not yet completed its rankings for 2007, but Ritsch said he has seen Biden's 2007 report and his net worth "hasn't changed much. I suspect he's still at the bottom of the list." It's a heady list. Senators had a median net worth of about $1.7-million in 2006, and 58 percent of the members rated as millionaires, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan research group Center for Responsive Politics. So where are the guys at the top of the ticket? In 2006, Obama's net worth was estimated at somewhere between $456,012 and $1,142,000, according to a CRP analysis. That earned him a ranking of 67th. But it's a ranking that is sure to go up. Obama's 2007 tax return showed earnings of $4.2-million, based largely on the sale of his books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope. McCain rode his wife's coattails to No. 8 in the 2006 ranking among senators, with an average net worth, $36.4-million. Much of McCain's wealth comes from his wife, Cindy McCain, who is chairman of Hensley & Co., her family's Arizona beer distributorship. So congratulations, Sen. Biden, you are in fact one of the least, if not the least, wealthy members of the U.S. Senate. For now. We bet book sales for a vice presidential candidate will soon change that.

pomt-00183	"He even supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/oct/19/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-attacks-molinaro-record-womens-issues/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo is keeping up the attacks on his Republican opponent, Marc Molinaro, as he campaigns for a third term. His latest ad, running online and also airing on television, focuses on issues important to women and criticizes Molinaro for opposing equal pay, abortion rights and taking guns away from domestic abusers among other positions. But one claim stood out. Cuomo says Molinaro "supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth." Where did that come from, and is it true? The Assembly bill As an Assembly member in 2009, Molinaro voted against a bill to prohibit the use of shackles and restraints on pregnant inmates who are in labor. In support of the "anti-shackling bill," women who had been incarcerated in New York State described how they were subject to the use of waist chains, handcuffs, and shackles, while they were in labor. Health care organizations called the restraints harmful to women and their babies. "Physically restraining a pregnant prisoner poses undue stress on both her and her baby, is uncomfortable and possibly could interfere with proper assessment of the patient's condition," the Medical Society of the State of New York wrote in a letter supporting the bill. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called for an end to the practice before the legislation. By 2009, at least four other states had enacted prohibitions on restraining inmates during delivery. Groups opposed to the bill included the New York State Association of Counties, which said it takes away discretion of local sheriffs and medical personnel. It could add expenses to local budgets, the association said. The New York State Sheriff’s Association also opposed the measure. The bill, S.1290-A/A.3373-A, won wide support, passing 61-0 in the Senate and 119-21 in the Assembly. The law restricts the use of restraints when pregnant inmates in labor are transported to a hospital and during delivery and recovery. During transport to a medical facility before labor, and only under "extraordinary circumstances," the law allows corrections staff to handcuff them by one wrist if the women are a danger to themselves or to medical or corrections personnel. No restraints may be used during labor or during recovery. The law calls for corrections personnel to stay with the woman during her hospital stay to keep her in custody. The law applies to state correctional facilities and local jails. Between 60 and 70 state prison inmates were pregnant in 2007 and 2008, according to Sen. Velmanette Montgomery, a bill sponsor. Molinaro's regret Molinaro said recently that he would not vote the same way today - not because he changed his mind about the substance of the bill, but because of politics. He said he voted against the 2009 bill because of concerns raised by physicians and corrections officers about women acting violently against themselves and their newborns, according to an article in the Poughkeepsie Journal. "The way the bill was written, there was no discretion," Molinaro told the newspaper’s editorial board. "It made a very black-and-white statement that could put women and children at risk." Molinaro explained his regret to the editorial board. "I regret that vote only in that I had to deal with it politically," he said. "The only reason I regret that vote is that you can spin it the way you wish." We asked the Molinaro campaign whether he had anything to add and if there is any context we should consider when evaluating Cuomo’s claim about Molinaro’s vote. Campaign spokeswoman Katherine Delgado provided a memo written by then-Gov. David Paterson when he signed the bill into law. Paterson acknowledged some people were concerned the law would be interpreted to apply to any pregnant woman being transported for any reason. Paterson wrote that he did not share that concern. The Molinaro campaign also drew attention to Paterson’s statement that he would prefer a bill that would allow corrections personnel to use discretion about whether to use a restraint if the inmate posed a risk to the public or could escape. Paterson decided not to veto the bill because inmates who are a danger to the public would also likely be a danger to themselves or medical or corrections personnel, as specified in the law. Inmates thinking about trying to escape would be deterred by the presence of a correctional officer, he said. In a video interview with USA TODAY Network, Molinaro pushed back on the use of the term "shackle" when describing restrained inmates. He was not directly asked about that vote. But speaking generally about votes that have come under scrutiny during the campaign, Molinaro said he has evolved. "If we want to be held and defined only by slices of our lives, we’ll get nowhere," he said. Our ruling Cuomo said Molinaro "supports putting a female inmate in shackles during childbirth." Molinaro was one of 21 Assembly members to vote against a bill that would prohibit the use of restraints on pregnant inmates held in local jails and state prisons during childbirth.

pomt-12166	Says a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they "can’t afford" Obamacare.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/blog-posts-dont-update-bad-details-about-couples-s/	A story shared on multiple websites about a New York couple who committed suicide because they couldn’t afford to pay for health care is the result of news outlets that at first wrote the pair left a note saying as much, but later walked back the claim. A July 28, 2017, post on NewsBreaksHere.com said a 53-year-old Manhattan chiropractor and his 50-year-old wife had jumped out of a high-rise window together, leaving a note that read, "We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care." The post noted that the suicide came "just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare," but that three members of the GOP had voted no, defeating the measure and keeping the Affordable Care Act in place. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. There was a double suicide in midtown Manhattan on July 28, according to the New York Post. Glenn Scarpelli and Patricia Colant jumped from the ninth floor of the building where they worked, leaving behind a 19-year-old son and 20-year-old daughter. The husband and wife also did leave a note, which read, "We had a wonderful life." But the couple was deeply in debt. The New York Post reported a lien showed they had owed more than $23,000 in federal taxes, and as of April 2015 they had more than $232,000 in debt. Scarpelli had faced legal action in 2013 for not paying back a $60,000 student loan. The "financial spiral" in which they were trapped was too much for the couple, who elected to jump to their deaths, the Post reported. There was no mention of medical costs, or health insurance premiums, or anything else related to the Affordable Care Act. So where did all these posts mentioning health care costs come from? Initial versions of the New York Post’s story apparently cited a law enforcement source that said there was a second note at the scene. That note reportedly read, "We both have medical issues, we just can't afford the health care." Later versions of the story corrected that assertion, saying a New York Police Department spokesman refuted that detail, and that there was no mention of health care costs in the couple’s sole suicide note. Several posts on different websites cited a version of the story from the U.K.’s Daily Mail, which appears to have included the same details and also was updated. Neither story indicates what was changed in the text during the subsequent updates. Using an uncorrected and incomplete version of the story led those posts to highlight the erroneous assertion that medical expenses, whether through high insurance premiums or procedural costs, drove the couple to suicide. Our ruling Bloggers said a New York physician and his wife jumped to their deaths because they "can’t afford" Obamacare. Multiple blog posts said that the couple committed suicide because of unaffordable medical costs. That was based on initial reports about the note the pair left behind, and turned out not to be the case. News outlets later took out references to health care expenses when they updated their stories, but the flawed information remained in other posts. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10837	"Our whole food system in this country...most of it is genetically engineered. And (there is) no testing for the health consequences of this food."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/11/dennis-kucinich/biotech-foods-less-widespread-and-better-tested-th/	At a cancer forum in Iowa sponsored by Lance Armstrong, Kucinich said, "In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration approved, without any scientific basis, the manufacturing of genetically modified organisms for food. Our whole food system in this country has now been — most of it is genetically engineered. And no safety testing was done, no testing for the health consequences of this food." He's exaggerating. First, a little history. The FDA caused a storm of controversy in 1992 when it declared that it would hold plants developed through biotechnology to the same standards as all other foods. Under the ruling, foods made with plants whose genetic material had been altered using biotechnology would not face higher scrutiny than foods produced in traditional ways. In 1994, the agency for the first time approved a bioengineered food product — a tomato that resisted rotting — for human consumption. Although the safety standards are the same for bioengineered and traditional foods, the agency says that, in practice, genetically modified foods usually receive a more thorough review. These foods are subject to a voluntary consultation process, where the producer can choose to review its own health research with the FDA's scientists. That process appears to give an advantage to the food companies, but it still involves more testing than Kucinich's statement suggests. As of 2004, every bioengineered food product on the market had completed this consultation process, the FDA said. (More recent statistics were not available.) So Kucinich exaggerates when he says that "no safety testing" has been done on the products that are on the market, although the process has been criticized for giving food companies too much influence. In 2001, the New York Times reported on the political considerations that went into the FDA's decisions on genetically engineered foods in the 1990s, revealing that many scientists in the agency had expressed doubts about the safety of the foods but were silenced by the focus on the deregulation of industry by the first Bush administration. Many environmental groups continue to push for greater regulation of genetically modified foods, including labeling, while the FDA continues to insist that these foods do not pose health risks to consumers. Kucinich is closer to the mark with his claim that most food is genetically engineered. The Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, says that a handful of genetically modified crops - mostly corn, soybeans, canola and cotton — account for most of the foods involved. But the group also estimates that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms. Joe Mendelson, the group's spokesman, said Kucinich "has firm ground to say it's penetrated our food markets a great deal. But it is certainly not everything."

NBC News called Eastman "the new darling of the left." She "rode a progressive wave," the Omaha World-Herald said of her May primary victory. Now Eastman gets to challenge a Republican incumbent, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, for the congressional seat in November. That has put her under the watch of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that wants to retain the House of Representatives’ Republican majority. The PAC, aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, released a TV and web ad on Sept. 4 saying that because Eastman was opposed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 -- the so-called Republican tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump just before Christmas -- and has spoken of repeal, a vote for Eastman would be a vote to "eliminate your tax cuts." "Your family," the ad says, would have to pay $2,500 more a year in taxes as a result. Eastman’s position, however, is more nuanced than that. What it really means The ad begins with an announcer saying, "We know Kara Eastman is a liberal. But what does that really mean?" If Eastman is elected, the ad says with a series of answers, Americans would pay $32 trillion. "That’s the cost of Eastman’s plan to give everyone free health care," the announcer says. Then the ad gives another figure, $600 billion. "That’s the price of Eastman’s free college plan," the announcer says. And finally: "$2,500 -- that’s how much more your family will pay after Eastman eliminates your tax cut." The first two figures are based on the legislative equivalent of moonshots for progressives like Eastman. For example, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, has said his College for All Act, eliminating tuition for families making $125,000 or less, would cost $600 billion, financed through a new "Wall Street speculation tax." And left- and right-leaning think tanks alike have pegged the cost of Sanders’ "Medicare for All Plan" around $32 trillion, although Sanders disputes the estimates. But free college and health care in the United States would require a political tsunami before they could get more than fleeting floor discussion in Congress. Eastman might support them but even if elected, she could be waiting a long time. The Kaiser Family Foundation last year suggested it could take "a prolonged national debate over making such a dramatic change to the U.S. health care system." That is why we are focusing here on something far more likely: a change in the tax rates and Eastman’s position specifically. If Congress doesn’t change the new tax law, in fact, Americans are practically guaranteed to face a tax hike within a decade. That’s because lawmakers structured individual tax cuts to expire by 2027, a way of making costs fit within 10-year congressional budget contours. The law can be amended and extended when the time is right -- and unless members of both parties want to face accusations that they raised taxes, they are almost certain to try to make those changes and keep many if not all of the individual tax cuts intact. That brings us back to Eastman’s position on those taxes and the claim we are examining. The Congressional Leadership Fund is telling residents in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District that "your family" will pay $2,500 more if Eastman gets her way. Will they? The facts To answer, we first asked the Congressional Leadership Fund to cite the basis of its claim. The PAC said the $2,500 figure is from a U.S. House Ways and Means Committee analysis in December of how much money families in each congressional district would save with the tax cuts. The committee’s Republican leaders said in their estimate that a married couple with two children in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District would get a median cut of $2,597. Next, we looked at why the Congressional Leadership Fund says Eastman would take these tax cuts away. The PAC said the elimination claim came specifically from a May 14 article in the Omaha World-Herald that described differences between Eastman and her Democratic primary campaign opponent. The article said: "The candidates agree that the recent Republican tax overhaul was overly tilted to the wealthy, but Eastman wants to repeal the law and go in the other direction while Ashford would want it to be rolled back. For example, the bill cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Eastman wants to see it at least returned to 35 percent, while Ashford would set the corporate rate at about 26 percent." If both parts are true -- that the median annual tax cut for a family of four in Eastman’s district was $2,500, and if Eastman "wants to repeal" the tax law -- then the claim would be accurate. But there’s more to it. Even the $2,500 figure is disputed. Figures for savings by middle-class families across the country have differed because of variables included or excluded in estimates, such as changes to deductions and exemptions, and even because of different methods of counting. As PolitiFact reported in July: "For 2018, the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the income scale is $780. That’s much less than it is for the top one-fifth of the income scale -- $5,790 -- and compared to the top 1 percent, at $32,650, it’s positively paltry." That’s a national figure. While the Ways and Means Committee says the average savings in Nebraska District 2 is $2,597, the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has put the savings for middle-class Nebraskans -- those earning $45,430 to $73,300 -- at $840. But the institute added that due to the scheduled expirations, those families’ taxes will rise by 2027. "The CLF ad is deceptive in that they are using fuzzy math and refuse to admit to voters that the Republican tax bill will raise taxes on middle-class families in Nebraska by 2027," said Heather Aliano, Eastman spokeswoman. Eastman’s plan Quibbling over sums aside, what about Eastman’s statement, as cited by the Congressional Leadership Fund, that she wants to repeal the law, a characterization -- but not an Eastman quote -- in the Omaha World-Herald? Courtney Alexander, the Congressional Leadership Fund’s communications director, told PolitiFact the article speaks volumes. "We are simply referring to an article by the Omaha World-Herald, which is arguably the most respected newspaper in the state," Alexander said. Yet the information on taxes was in a single paragraph highlighting the candidates’ general positions, not the details. We found several more detailed descriptions, and Eastman’s campaign sent us others. None spoke of repealing the entirety of the 2007 tax cuts. Nor, for that matter, did the article that the Congressional Leadership Fund says it based its ad on. In that single paragraph on taxes, Eastman said she wanted the corporate income tax rate returned to 35 percent, but she did not speak about individual rates. That turned out to be consistent with more detailed quotes and statements elsewhere in which Eastman criticized the December tax package as too generous to the wealthy but never said she wanted to take away middle-class tax cuts. In an interview with the Gateway, an independent, student-run newspaper and website at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Eastman said in August that "we need to be thinking more about regular people." "I would like to see that tax bill flipped so that we are taxing the very wealthy and large corporations at a fair rate," she said in that interview. "Giving them a tax break does not benefit Nebraskans. It actually just benefits the CEOs of those companies and the shareholders. And we're seeing clearly that cutting taxes for the very wealthy is not the way to boost the economy." On her campaign website, Eastman says, "The U.S. has to generate more revenue to pay down our $20 trillion debt by raising the top tax rate and eliminating corporate tax loopholes." The website says nothing about overall repeal. Discussing this with the Congressional Leadership Fund, Alexander again cited the newspaper language that said Eastman wants to "go in the other direction" from the one the tax bill followed. Although that direction was not specified in the article the PAC cites, Alexander said that "if you repeal the tax cuts, the tax rates go up. Kara Eastman said she wants to repeal the bill." Eastman has not said she wants to repeal everything, however. She has not laid out her own tax plan or proposal, but she has said repeatedly that she wants rates to go back up for the rich, not the middle class. "That tax plan is a dupe to Americans, to the middle class, to working people, and we need to flip that tax plan on its end," she told KETV, Omaha’s ABC affiliate, on March 12. Asked how she would change it, she spoke about "taxing the very wealthy, the 1 percent and corporations." Aliano, the campaign spokeswoman, told PoltiFact, "Kara doesn’t want to see tax rates rise for the middle class. She’d like to maintain the tax breaks the middle class receives long term -- something the Republican tax plan doesn’t do." Our ruling The claim that Eastman will raise taxes on "your family" by $2,500 is based on a generalization in a single article that could be open to interpretation. It need not be viewed in isolation, because a body of interviews and statements exists that show more specifically what Eastman would do. She would raise rates on the wealthy. She has not spoken of raising rates on the middle class. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10759	Obama spokesman Bill Burton says Clinton gave Bush "a blank check on a critical foreign policy issue."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/29/barack-obama/not-quite-a-blank-check/	A spokesman for Barack Obama said that Hillary Clinton gave President Bush a "blank check" by voting for the Kyl-Lieberman Amendment declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a terrorist organization. Obama and other Democrats have tried to use Clinton's vote to portray her as careless on Iran and remind voters she backed President Bush's request to go to war with Iraq. Obama advisers say the Kyl-Lieberman amendment provides a new rationale for keeping U.S. troops in Iraq and could be used to justify an attack on Iran. "Without a doubt," Obama adviser Greg Craig said in a memo, "President Bush can cite that language as authorizing him to maintain and use U.S. troops in Iraq for the purpose of containing Iran, curtailing Iran's influence in Iraq, and, if need be, to expand our troops' activities beyond Iraq's borders to pursue and attack Iranian forces." Sen. Joe Biden made that argument forcefully in a statement after the vote, arguing that the Bush administration has interpreted laws in ways Congress did not intend. "I don't trust this administration not to twist its words into a justification for war," Biden said. "I don't trust this administration to follow the plain meaning of the law." But Clinton emphasized that the amendment was "non-binding" and that it "in no way authorizes or sanctions military action against Iran." So which side is right? Some foreign policy analysts — and a senator who supports Obama — say it's an exaggeration to call the amendment a "blank check." "It's non-binding, so it has no policy implications, let alone legal implications," said Michael A. Ledeen, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "It's posturing." Sen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat supporting Obama, told Bloomberg Television that the resolution does not give authority "to invade Iran or any other country ... I have the same concerns that Barack Obama does about this administration and what they might do with the power that they have. But I don't think this resolution gives them a green light to do anything." But other analysts say that while the legislation may not appear to be a blank check, the Bush administration may try to use it that way. "I think it's sort of a stretch, but this administration has been known to make that stretch previously," said Max Bergmann, deputy director of the National Security Network, a left-leaning group that studies national security. "It's getting into an area where Congress and our country have been burned before." Given the differing interpretations, we rate the "blank check" claim to be Half True.

pomt-04050	"Washington, D.C., had some of the strictest gun laws in the country. And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/28/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-after-dc-passed-gun-laws-viol/	Do gun laws work? As lawmakers consider President Barack Obama's call to take action against gun violence after mass shootings in Connecticut, Colorado, Wisconsin and Arizona, some argue new rules won’t help. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told Fox News that Obama’s plan — which proposes steps such as closing background check loopholes and banning military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — is "not going to solve the problem." "Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country," Rubio told host Brian Kilmeade on Jan. 17, 2013. "And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed." We wanted to know: Did violence leap after the nation’s capital cracked down on guns? Unprotected citizens In 1976, the District of Columbia required all guns to be registered, banned new handguns and required guns at home to be stored unloaded and disassembled or locked up. The law’s handgun ban was invalidated by federal courts in 2007, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. But for three decades, the nation’s capital had some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country. We’ll note that the president isn’t proposing D.C.’s gun laws — indeed, the Supreme Court took that off the table — so it’s a comparison of questionable value. But we were curious whether Rubio was correct to say that Washington’s handgun ban was followed by violence. Why would violence climb after such a ban? Rubio’s office declined to explain, but a Jan. 15, 2013, opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal by journalist and attorney Jeffrey Scott Shapiro makes a similar argument: The gun ban had an unintended effect: It emboldened criminals because they knew that law-abiding District residents were unarmed and powerless to defend themselves. Violent crime increased after the law was enacted, with homicides rising to 369 in 1988, from 188 in 1976 when the ban started. By 1993, annual homicides had reached 454. Shapiro’s homicide numbers match the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics. But when we looked at related data, it was quickly apparent he chose statistics that told a simple story — pass ban, violent crime soars — that was in reality much more complicated. We reached out to Shapiro to ask for research to support his conclusion, but didn’t hear back. Violent crime rates in the District of Columbia from 1976 look like a rockin’ roller coaster, dipping slightly after the ban’s passage, climbing steadily until the early ‘80s, diving again through the late ‘80s, then climbing a steep mountain until the early ‘90s. Then violent crime, as in the rest of the country, fell steeply, settling into a slower cruise downward since the start of the new century. (It’s still much more violent in the District than the rest of the nation, with 1,330 violent crimes per 100,000 people compared with 363 per 100,000 for the entire country in 2010.) But Shapiro cited the annual homicide number for 1993 — the height of violent crime in the four decades we’re examining — then later says: Since the gun ban was struck down, murders in the District have steadily gone down, from 186 in 2008 to 88 in 2012, the lowest number since the law was enacted in 1976. He fails to mention that drop started in 1994. Weapon-choice theory But back to Rubio. In his Fox News interview, he didn’t claim the gun ban caused the crime rate to rise. But he does say that the gun laws are "not going to solve the problem," citing D.C.’s experience as an example. We know that violent crime didn’t simply "skyrocket" in the District after the handgun ban passed in 1976. It took a rocky path with peaks in 1981 and 1993, and has generally fallen since then. A similar trend echoed across the United States. That suggests a wide range of factors at work, not merely D.C.’s gun laws. Some experts who study violence, such as Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, say the early ‘80s peak and fall can largely be attributed to the baby boomer generation entering their teens and 20s and then growing up. (People tend to be more law abiding as they age.) The later U.S. peak, Blumstein said, came with crack cocaine and President Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs. And the fall in violent crime since then? Theories include the passage of Roe vs. Wade and a reduction in environmental lead. Blumstein argues an important part of the explanation was the decline in the demand for crack as people saw its effects in older friends and relatives, "and aggressive actions by police in taking the guns off the street." Ah, so, back to gun laws. What, if any, role did they play in violent crime in the District of Columbia? There’s not a lot of fresh research on the subject, since Congress put a chill on government-funded firearms research starting in the late ‘90s. (Something that the president’s recent executive actions seek to reverse.) But Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California at Davis School of Medicine, pointed us to a 1991 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. "Sen. Rubio couldn't be more wrong," he told PolitiFact. The study, conducted by a research group at the University of Maryland and University at Albany, examined suicides and homicides in the District of Columbia compared with nearby cities from 1968 to 1987. They found that the adoption of the gun-licensing law "coincided with an abrupt decline" in gun-related deaths not found just across the border. Nor were there increases in homicides or suicides that didn’t use guns. "Our data suggest that restrictions on access to guns in the District of Columbia prevented an average of 47 deaths each year after the law was implemented," the authors concluded. Despite widely circulated Internet criticism to the contrary, researchers did consider the effects of population changes, including age and population size. They got similar results. How did the laws help? The researchers argued the data supported something called the weapon-choice theory. When people don’t have easy access to guns, some will use a less deadly form of force. So even if the number of assaults and suicide attempts stays the same, with fewer guns, deaths drop. The researchers argued their results showed it was reasonable to assume that even with violent crime rising, restrictions on gun access had "a preventive effect." In other words, even if "violence skyrocketed," as Rubio said, that’s not direct evidence that D.C.’s gun laws failed to help. Of course, they also didn’t fully "solve the problem." Our ruling Rubio, expressing his disappointment in Obama’s recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldn’t solve the problem. "Washington, D.C. had some of the strictest gun laws in the country," he said. "And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed." Crime statistics don’t support Rubio’s simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws’ role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate — in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place — but leaves out important details and context.

pomt-06233	The balanced-budget amendment once came within one vote of passing Congress but was defeated because of the no vote from a top Senate Republican, and Rick Santorum says he "stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/rick-santorum/Rick-Santorum-says-he-called-for-resignation/	A Republican lodestar this year is passage of a balanced budget amendment, a constitutional change requiring Washington to balance its books every year, with some exceptions, such as if the country is at war. So far, the proposal has failed to get the two-thirds majority required in the U.S. House, falling short in a 261-165 vote on Nov. 18, 2011. It’s slated to be voted on by the Senate in December -- a vote was a requirement of last summer’s debt-ceiling deal -- but two-thirds passage there is unlikely given that the chamber is controlled by Democrats, even though some have supported it in the past. Even if the measure were to clear Congress, it would still need approval from legislatures in 38 states to become part of the Constitution. Nonetheless, it remains a key talking point for Republicans on the presidential campaign trail. And in a Nov. 29, 2011, op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asserted that the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of passing Congress and going to the states during his first year in the Senate. He also said that he’s not afraid to expose fellow Republicans who stand in its way. "The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work," Santorum wrote. "The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding ‘no’ vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals." Did that really happen? And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue? Santorum campaign aide Matt Benyon said his boss was referring to a vote in 1995, Santorum’s first year in the Senate, and that the Republican in question was the late Mark Hatfield, who died in August 2011 at 89. Santorum on Jan. 4, 1995, became a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate. This was the era when Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich’s Contract With America, had swept into power in the House and Senate, and the amendment, then as now, was a major part of their agenda. It passed the House, with more than the two-thirds majority required, on a 300-132 vote on Jan. 26, 1995, but failed to reach the two-thirds mark by one vote in the U.S. Senate on a 65-35 vote on March 2, 1995. While several Democrats voted for the measure -- including then-U.S. Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Paul Simon, D-Ill., and current Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa -- the lone Republican to oppose the measure was Hatfield. The Oregon Republican and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the measure a "procedural gimmick." Santorum, then only 36 (the New York Times pointed out that Hatfield was first elected governor of Oregon in 1958, the year Santorum was born), called for the veteran lawmaker to be stripped of his committee leadership, as did some other young Republican Turks. "He can vote against the balanced-budget amendment. But he shouldn’t be in leadership," Santorum said at the time. "This is an issue that is at the core of what Republicanism is all about … I see this as a major stumbling block in the way of the agenda." For his part, Hatfield, who had served in the Senate for 28 years at that point, stood his ground, saying, "I do not care for the implication -- and I only say implication -- that perhaps a conscience vote is no longer possible on the Republican side of the aisle." A variety of senior Republican lawmakers, ranging from North Carolina’s Jesse Helms to Vermont’s Jim Jeffords, spoke in favor of Hatfield's right to break ranks on the issue. Defending Hatfield at the time, Jeffords told the Times, "He is a moderate, and moderates can make or break this Senate. Either we can have compromise, or we can have gridlock." Hatfield held onto his committee chairmanship, though he opted not to run for a sixth term in 1996. Our ruling Santorum was correct in stating the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of clearing Congress and that the vote by the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations committee against it was key to its failure to pass. Hatfield said he opposed it because he viewed it as a "gimmick." And Santorum and others did call for Hatfield's resignation as committee chairman. Santorum's description of his role as evidence of his leadership skills is an opinion, and we don't check opinions. But he has the basic history right. We give his statement a True.

pomt-11103	Under Philip Levine, Miami Beach "passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable and never enforced. He passed a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/09/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-philip-levines-record-miami-beach-ma/	As he makes his run to become Florida’s governor, Democrat Philip Levine often touts the more progressive moves he made during his time as mayor of Miami Beach. Chief among them is increasing the minimum wage and banning assault weapons. "Everyone wants to tell you what they’re gonna do in the future, but no one wants to tell you what they’ve done," Levine said June 9. "Well let me tell you what I’ve done as mayor: I raised the minimum living wage in the city of Miami Beach and I plan to do it statewide. We actually decriminalized marijuana. We’ve had the highest LGBTQ scores in the entire state of Florida. We became the leading poster child on sea-level rise and climate change and by the way, we banned assault rifles." But one of Levine’s opponents in 2018 Democratic primary says Levine’s achievements aren’t as successful as he sometimes makes it seem. "They passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable and never enforced," said Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. "(Philip Levine) passed a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced." Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. Miami Beach passed a resolution urging lawmakers to adopt an assault rifle ban, but it wasn’t a ban. It was a resolution that carried no legal authority. As for the minimum wage increase, Miami Beach passed an ordinance to gradually increase it to $13.31 per hour by 2021, but it was struck down by the courts before it went into effect. Assault rifle 'ban' On July 13, 2016, the Miami Beach Commissioners adopted a resolution urging Congress and the Florida Legislature to lobby for assault weapons bans. It also urges the Florida Legislature to lift the preemption policy that prevents local governments from enacting gun control ordinances. The resolution had no legal authority, though. That’s because resolutions, according to the Florida Statutes, are a statement of position, not an official legislative action of a governing body like a law. "A resolution of the city commission of the city of Miami Beach, Florida, calling upon the federal and state-elected officials to collaborate with local officials and first responders to prevent mass shootings… ," the resolution heading says. So rather than an actual ban, the resolution was really more of a call to action for lawmakers to consider banning assault weapons. It did not impede Miami Beach’s access to them. The resolution wouldn’t have survived. Under Florida law, any local officials who try to enact gun regulations that are more restrictive than state law face fines up to $5,000 or even removal from office. Florida cities, including Miami Beach, have sued Gov. Rick Scott so they can enact tougher local gun regulations. As we mentioned, Levine sometimes touts this achievement with no additional clarifications, but at one point during the June 9 debate, Levine acknowledged that the assault weapon ban "wasn’t enforceable." "As the mayor of Miami Beach we did many things," Levine said. "From reforming a police department from raising the minimum wage to fighting back sea level rise to decriminalizing marijuana to banning assault rifles even, though unfortunately, it was not enforceable." Minimum wage In June 2016, Miami Beach Commissioners voted to gradually raise its minimum wage in the city from $8.05 to $13.31 per hour by 2021. The increase would have been enforced basically starting January 2018 and gone up every year until reaching the 2021 threshold. The law never went in to effect, though. Florida Circuit Court Judge Peter Lopez ruled in March 2017 that Miami Beach's minimum wage law was pre-empted by a state statute preventing local minimum wages from exceeding the state rate. A panel of the 3rd District Court of Appeal upheld Lopez’s ruling, but Miami Beach (along with other cities) asked the Florida Supreme Court to review the December 13 appellate court ruling. So, Gillum is right that no one really got the benefit of it. The one thing worth noting is that Gillum could have been more precise in describing the action Miami Beach took. Gillum said it was a resolution, but it was an ordinance. This means that the minimum wage increase, unlike the assault weapon resolution, would have been enforced had it not been struck down. During the debate, Levine alluded to issues with the minimum wage effort. "In 2004, the people of Florida voted that the local municipality should have the right to enforce and set their own minimum wage," Levine said. "That's what we did. Unfortunately, we got sued by the governor, the state of Florida, the Retail Federation. We are fighting it in court and we believe it's going to go to the Florida Supreme Court and we're going to win. The fact of that matter is we did it." Our ruling Gillum said Levine "passed a resolution to ban assault rifles, which was not enforceable," and passed "a resolution to raise the minimum wage, which actually no one got the benefit of because it was not enforced." Gillum’s claim is largely accurate. He could have been more precise in describing the legislative action Miami Beach took, but his general idea for both initiatives is accurate. The assault weapon "ban" that Levine talks about was a symbolic resolution, not an actual ban. And the minimum wage increase was struck down before taking effect in 2018.

pomt-00057	"Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/02/north-dakota-NPL/voting-will-not-cost-hunting-license-north-dakota/	The North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party is running a Facebook ad in North Dakota that claims your hunting license is at risk. It’s not. "Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses," says the Facebook ad, which began running on Nov. 1. We ran the ad by Cameron Wimpy, research director at MIT Election Data and Science Lab. "I do absolutely think it is voter suppression to try and trick folks this way," Wimpy said. Most North Dakota hunters can breathe easy. If you have an out-of-state hunting license anywhere outside of North Dakota -- and it’s an out-of-state license, rather than a residential one for residents of that state -- you’re safe. If you have a North Dakota residential hunting license, you’re also safe, because in applying for that license you already gave up any other residential licenses. North Dakota’s Game and Fish department doesn’t allow a person to hold two residential licenses. (Those tend to expire within a season or year anyway.) In theory, this applies to folks living in North Dakota who have a residential license in a state other than North Dakota, which conceivably could be people who have just moved. (This is the basis on which the North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party, which is the state’s branch of the Democratic Party, defended the ad.) Would casting a vote in North Dakota make even those licenses void? We found no evidence of that. We called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota’s neighboring states: Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota. They all told us that voting in North Dakota wouldn’t make them lose their licenses. "If they purchased that license prior to leaving Montana as legal resident, it is valid until the expiration date, no matter what they do in North Dakota," said Ron Jendro, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department. The same goes for Wyoming, South Dakota and Minnesota; the licenses are valid until they expire. For other states, establishing residency elsewhere means their resident hunting license is void. That’s the case in North Dakota and Kentucky, the two other states whose hunting permit offices we called. But there’s no way that casting a vote would suddenly make those licenses null. Lee Ann Oliver, elections specialist at the North Dakota Secretary of State’s office, told us they have a central voter file, but fish and wildlife departments don’t get access to that database. And anyway, in order to vote, a person has to already have established residency. "They’re putting the cart before the horse," Oliver said. "You have to be a resident before you can vote." Voters can show a North Dakota driver’s license, nondriver’s identification card, tribal ID or long term care card. If those don’t include a current North Dakota residential address or date of birth, the voter may supplement their ID with a variety of documents, like bills or bank statements. Our ruling North Dakota Democratic-NPL said, "Attention hunters: Voting in North Dakota could cost you your out-of-state hunting licenses." It’s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting. But voting will not cost anyone their hunting licenses. People with out-of-state hunting licenses get to keep their licenses; the warning only applies to people with residential licenses in another state who recently moved to North Dakota. Voting would not make those null, but establishing residency in another state, which is a prerequisite to voting, might, depending on the state. The ad employs a ridiculous argument.

pomt-05291	Says the majority of candidates in Texas’ 25th Congressional District live outside the district.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/23/justin-hewlett/justin-hewlett-says-majority-districts-congression/	Justin Hewlett, among a dozen Republicans seeking to represent a new tornado-shaped U.S. House district running north toward Fort Worth from western Hays and Travis counties, points out in a recent mailer that members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they represent. The Constitution holds that House members must be residents of the state -- not the district -- they represent. So it’s legal, say, for a member representing Central Texas to live in El Paso or Port Arthur or Brownsville, though we cannot recall such a farflung turn. Hewlett’s mailer continues: "In fact, the majority of the (Congressional) District 25 candidates reside outside of the district." We were curious if Hewlett was right that at least seven of the GOP aspirants do not live in the district, which brings together parts or all of 13 counties including Burnet, Lampasas, Bosque, Hill and (smidges of) Tarrant and Bell counties. The sole Democratic candidate, Elaine Henderson, lives near Austin in Lago Vista, which is in the district. Hewlett -- the mayor of Cleburne, in Johnson County, which is in the district -- told us in a telephone interview that he checked each opponent’s filings with the Federal Election Commission and researched home addresses online. By email, he passed along his breakdown indicating that five candidates do not live in the district, while three candidates might have moved in after declaring their candidacies. According to Hewlett’s breakdown, candidate Ernie Beltz Jr. lives in Cedar Park, not in the district; Bill Burch lives in Grand Prairie, not in the district; Dianne Costa lives in Lewisville, not in the district; Michael Williams has an Arlington home and an Austin apartment, both not in the district; and James Dillon lists his hometown as Liberty Hill, not in the district. Wes Riddle lives in Belton, Hewlett told us, just outside the district. Hewlett wrote: "Since taking some ‘heat’ about not living in the district, (Riddle) bought a property" in Gatesville, in the district, and changed his voter registration to that address. Dave Garrison, Hewlett said, has listed an address in Horseshoe Bay, just outside the district, but claims to have an apartment in Bee Cave, near Austin, in the district. "If this is true, it is likely that he has changed his voter registration to the apartment in Bee Cave," Hewlett told us. Finally, Hewlett wrote, Roger Williams is from Weatherford, outside the district, but when he declared his candidacy he said he and his wife would buy an Austin home. "He is now claiming they own a house in Austin," Hewlett said. "If this is true, it is likely that he has now changed his residence to Austin." The unmentioned Republican candidates in his analysis are Chad Wilbanks of Austin; Brian Mathews of Austin; and Charlie Holcomb of Wimberley, all presumably living in the district. Separately, Wilbanks pointed out a news article on the candidates in the March 17, 2012, Killeen Daily Herald stating that six candidates, or half, live within its boundaries and six -- Beltz, Burch, Costa, Dillon and Michael and Roger Williams -- do not. To launch our own check, we asked the election commission if it tracks where House candidates live. A commission spokesman, Christian Hilland, advised by email that the agency is not required to collect home addresses of House candidates; most addresses on file are for candidate postal boxes or campaign headquarters. Next, we played Dial-A-Candidate, focusing on candidates listed as non-residents in the Herald story plus those whose residency is questioned by Hewlett. We then confirmed three candidates as non-residents, while four said they indeed live, and vote, in the district. Dillon, listed as living in Liberty Hill, outside the district, declined to discuss his residency. Details: --Burch told us he lives in Grand Prairie, outside the district, though hopes to move into the district before November 2012. --Beltz confirmed that he lives in Cedar Park, about two miles outside the district. --Costa said she lives outside the district in Denton County’s Highland Village, though her family has a 230-acre ranch in Hamilton County, which is in the district. "I pay taxes in the district. I have an investment in the district," Costa said. --Michael Williams’ campaign manager, Will Fullerton, told us that Williams got an apartment in the Austin part of the district after the race started and registered to vote there. Vanessa Shaw of the Travis County Tax Office separately told us by phone that Williams registered to vote in the county in early 2012. --Rachel Nolen of Riddle’s campaign said the candidate has offices in Belton and Austin, but lives in Gatesville, which is in Coryell County and the district. Peggy Vaden of the Coryell County Tax Office later told us by phone that Riddle registered to vote there in August 2011 and has since voted there twice. --Steve Ray, a consultant to Garrison’s campaign, said that while Garrison has a Horseshoe Bay house just outside the district, he has lived and voted in Bee Cave, near Austin and in the district, since at least last fall. Shaw, of the Travis County office, said Garrison registered to vote in the county in September 2011. --Roger Williams moved into a West Austin apartment in the district on March 16, 2012, his campaign spokesman, Kasey Pipes, told us by email. Asked about Williams’ Weatherford home, Pipes replied: "He’s keeping two residences, but his primary residence will be in Austin." Shaw told us Williams’ registration to vote in the county took effect in May 2012. Our ruling Our conclusion is that four of the 12 Republican candidates -- not the majority, as Hewlett says -- live (and vote) outside the district. Still, some hopefuls lived outside the district until not long ago, giving Hewlett’s claim an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08820	Kathryn Starkey "aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/group-raps-kathryn-starkey-aiding-and-abetting-tax/	A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax. The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.) "Taxin’ Kathryn," says the mailer sent in early August 2010 . "With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?" We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her voting record on setting tax rates. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving the sales tax. After questioning Starkey’s attendance record as a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, the mailer says that when she did attend, "Starkey aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same DESPITE skyrocketing property values that allowed local governments to pad their budgets." Here is what the minutes show. Of the seven budget meetings she attended, the board voted six times to keep the tax rate the same. Starkey voted with her colleagues five out of those six times (She cast a dissenting vote in 2006). So overall, she voted over 70 percent of the time to keep the same tax rate. All this came as taxable values were soaring in Pinellas and Pasco counties. Between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2007, when the rate stayed at 40 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, the total taxable values for the basin board went from roughly $48 billion to $81 billion in Pasco and Pinellas counties, according to Southwest Florida Water Management District. By the time the board lowered the rate to 37 cents for fiscal year 2008, the total values were roughly $86.6 billion. Simply counting votes misses an important fact, though. Starkey did make efforts to lower the tax rate. In 2004, for instance, she made a motion to lower the rate to 39 cents. The motion died for lack of a second, and Starkey went along with the rest of the board to keep the tax rate the same. And it was Starkey who took the lead role in 2006 when she again argued for lowering the rate, this time making a motion to set it at 37 1/2 cents. The motion failed. She tried again, arguing for 38 cents. Her motion failed again. The board voted 3 to 2 to keep it at 40 cents, and Starkey dissented for the first time. At the preliminary budget meeting in June 2007, Starkey made the motion to set the rate for the 2008 budget at 37 cents, which finally passed. "Every year I tried to roll it back," she said, but didn’t have the votes. Pennington’s mailer is technically correct: Starkey did go along with votes most of the time to keep the tax rate for the basin board the same, even as taxable values soared. But it leaves out the important context that Starkey tried over three years to lower the tax rate. We rate this Half True.

pomt-08057	Texas "children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching."	true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/26/mike-villarreal/rep-mike-villarreal-says-texas-students-may-have-t/	In the flurry to pre-file legislation before the Texas legislative session starts in January, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, announced a proposal he said "would end the practice of Texas schools hiring full-time teachers with no classroom teaching experience." "Parents are shocked when I tell them that their children may have a teacher who never spent one minute practicing teaching but is now responsible for educating a classroom full of kids," Villarreal said in a Nov. 30 press release. "If we are serious about improving education, we need to listen to the research about the importance of student teaching. We shouldn't hand the classroom over to a teacher who has never stood in front of a class and taught a lesson." Any questions? We decided to check how much practical experience is required of newly-minted Texas schoolteachers. On its website, the State Board for Educator Certification lists the basic requirements for becoming a Texas teacher: a bachelor's degree, teacher training through an approved program (universities and "other entities" such as for-profit programs) and completion of state teacher certification tests. Texas has 177 teacher preparation programs, run by providers including universities, school districts and for-profit companies, according to a November 2009 Houston Chronicle news story. Traditional university programs include a student-teaching component prior to graduation. For aspiring teachers who already have a college degree, SBEC suggests "alternative certification and post-baccalaureate programs." According to the website, "many of these programs can be completed in a year, during which time you may have a paid teaching position in a public school classroom." According to the Texas Education Agency, 7,500 new teachers during the 2010 academic school year were certified through university programs, and 11,567 were certified via alternative programs. Asked to back up Villarreal's statement, Peter Clark, his legislative director, pointed to those teachers who are in alternative programs. "They do not receive their full certification until the end of that first year teaching," he said in an e-mail. "But during that full school year they are the teacher of record responsible for a classroom, and they may have started that year without ever standing in front of a classroom of students and delivering a lesson plan." According to state law, teacher candidates who serve a year-long internship have a "probationary certificate" until they complete the year, but during that time they're classified as a "teacher" on school campuses. Does that mean they haven't had any teaching practice before entering the classroom? Karen Loonam, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that it "is possible" for someone to start teaching without any practice teaching "but highly unlikely since our rules require 30 clock-hours of field experience in the classroom and 80 hours of training prior to entering the classroom." According to state law, 15 of those 30 hours of field experience must be spent performing "professional educator activities" while interacting with students, teachers and faculty in a school setting "that is part of regular classroom instruction." According to Villarreal's press release, his legislation "would require a teacher candidate to undertake 15 hours of practice teaching to become full-time teachers... this legislation would ensure that the 15 hours on campus are spent delivering lesson plans rather than merely observing, assisting with administrative functions or attending school events." In an interview, Janice Lopez, the education agency's director of educator standards, told us the law doesn't require that those 15 hours in the classroom are spent teaching. "We require that they go through training and hopefully that training is interactive — interacting with students while observing a certified teacher," Lopez said. Loonam told us that usually the field experience is "a combination of activities for an individual to see the realities of the complex job of teaching — how does the teacher develop lesson plans... observing students... classroom management. We've tried to put in our rules some requirements to help these people get prepared before entering the classroom," she said. Loonam also told us that school districts' "late hires" may start teaching in the classroom without having those 15 classroom hours. "If a principal finds out on a Thursday — and school's going to start Monday — that she just lost a teacher for whatever reason, she needs to find someone to fill that vacancy," she said. If there's a teacher shortage in that particular district, the district may hire a prospective teacher who knows about the subject to be taught but doesn't have the required training. The new teacher is then assigned a certified teacher as a mentor and completes training throughout the school year. Ed Fuller, a researcher for the University Council for Educational Administration, an interstate consortium of higher-ed institutions, called the Texas education code's practice-teaching requirement "vague." "Teachers are not, in fact, required to complete any practice teaching or student teaching before becoming a teacher of record" — a teacher who has sole responsibility for a class, he said. Fuller said teachers without any experience come largely from alternative certification programs that don't offer student-teaching training. But according to Vernon Reaser, who heads an alternative teacher-certification program based in Houston, the alternate route is more demanding than the single semester of student-teaching required by university programs. Alternate-route teacher candidates must first complete a year of professional teaching — the internship — as a real teacher before the principal decides whether the teacher should be certified, said Reaser, president of A+ Texas Teachers. He told us most prospective teachers who are certified through the program do practice teach, "and those that don't will get it anyway in the first few months. "This is the person's career, not just a temporary assignment like student teaching is," he said. "They have to perform well that year just like every other teacher does in order to keep their job." We also consulted Pamela Hall, a personnel administrator for the Austin Independent School District, who told us the district rarely hires individuals without teaching experience, but when it does, it's through the state's alternate certification programs. Such teachers are on probation for their first year, she said. Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, told us the agency does not keep information on how many individuals never taught before becoming classroom teachers. She said that information is kept by each certification program. Time to grade Villarreal's statement. We did not find a precise count of teachers in Austin or Texas public schools who started without teaching practice, though, significantly, it's undisputed that schools can — and do — hire teachers lacking even a minute of experience teaching a class. We rate the statement True.	None	Mike Villarreal	None	None	None	2010-12-26T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['Texas']
pomt-05991	Suzanne Bonamici supports a plan that will cut choice for Medicare Advantage seniors.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/21/rob-cornilles/does-suzanne-bonamici-support-plan-reduces-choice-/	Republican Rob Cornilles continues his attack on Democrat Suzanne Bonamici, claiming once again this week on Think Out Loud that her support of President Obama’s 2010 health care reform act means that she supports cuts to seniors on Medicare and Medicare Advantage. "…She supports taking $500 billion away from Medicare. I don’t support that. It would largely affect those seniors who are on Medicare Advantage, which is about a quarter of a million Oregon seniors. They’ve chosen that option. I want to maintain they have that choice. She does not." Cornilles and Republicans nationally have refused to back off their erroneous claim that Obama’s Affordable Care Act cuts $500 billion from Medicare. As we reported in November 2011 and in October 2010, the act reduces Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But those dollars don’t come out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits. As PolitiFact Oregon’s Ryan Kost reported: "The $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law’s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending." An initially estimated $136 billion of the $500 billion in future savings is to come from Medicare Advantage. What is Medicare Advantage? Let’s back up for a moment. Every person 65 or older gets what’s called original Medicare or traditional Medicare. It consists of Part A, which covers hospital care, and Part B, which covers doctor visits. You can get these services from any provider who sees Medicare patients. Part A is free; Part B premiums usually come out of your Social Security check. Some private insurers also offer what’s called Medicare Advantage, Part C, where seniors can pay an extra monthly premium for services not covered by plain Medicare A and B, such as vision, hearing and dental. Often, these plans will include Part D, which is the prescription drug plan pushed by then President George W. Bush in 2003. Some seniors prefer Medicare Advantage plans because they are comprehensive, with all billing through one entity, said Joe Baker, president of the nonpartisan advocacy group Medicare Rights Center. Other seniors might prefer traditional Medicare because they travel a lot and don’t stick to one region, or they want services that aren’t covered by advantage plans. "There are trade-offs with both," Baker said. Now, why would Congress want to reduce future growth in Medicare Advantage spending? Because it’s considered bloated. As the Kaiser Family Foundation reported in a 2010 video primer, Congress in previous years had increased payments to private insurers who offer Medicare Advantage plans in order to increase enrollment in those plans. Insurers used that extra money to offer more benefits to those people, such as vision and dental care. "However, as a result of this payment system Medicare actually pays more for beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage plans than it pays for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare," says Tricia Neuman, a vice president of the Kaiser Foundation and director of the Medicare Policy Project. "This has increased costs to the Medicare program. These over-payments also contribute to Medicare’s fiscal problems, shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund and actually increasing payments paid by other beneficiaries." (Kaiser Health News reported in December 2011 that according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the government spent in 2011 "10 percent more for beneficiaries enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) plans than if those beneficiaries were in fee-for-service Medicare.") Ah-ha! So private insurers are making out nicely off of Medicare Advantage plans, leaving traditional Medicare recipients to pick up the slack. We can see why government would want reform. Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, says that’s besides the point. Bonamici supports the Affordable Care Act. Ostrom says that means Bonamici supports eliminating choice for seniors. "Whether services are cut, contracts terminated or out-of-pocket expenses grow unaffordable, it is completely reasonable to suggest that when people must drop from a plan they like, they are forced out. A $900-a-year increase in out-of-pocket costs would be considered unaffordable by many seniors. They have no choice," Ostrom said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon in November 2011. Is Ostrom correct on that front? Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, projected in an April 2010 memo that "[t]he new provisions will generally reduce (Medicare Advantage) rebates to plans and thereby result in less generous benefit packages." He estimated that by 2017, enrollment will be 7.4 million rather than the originally projected 14.8 million. (As of September 2011, 11.9 million were enrolled.) A follow-up from Foster, as posted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance website in October 2010, states that out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries should grow to $873 a year by 2019. Yet, the Kaiser Family Foundation cautions against sweeping predictions inits October 2010 report: "The HHS Actuaries predict a decline in enrollment between 2011 and 2019, and an erosion of extra benefits. However, such predictions are difficult, and at the present time, Medicare Advantage appears to remain an important part of the Medicare program." It turns out that enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans increased 6 percent from from 2010 to 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. Enrollment was projected to increase again in 2012 and average premiums decrease. In the past we gave Cornilles a False for perpetuating the inaccurate statement that Bonamici and other Democrats support $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, hurting seniors. Here, however, he’s making a more specific point about seniors on Medicare Advantage. It’s hard to know what will happen to Medicare Advantage, but it’s undeniable that reduced payments to insurers could result in higher costs or decreased benefits for seniors. We acknowledge that truth in the statement. Still, there’s significant information missing. The Affordable Care Act was designed to save money by slowing future spending, including future spending on Medicare Advantage plans. But spending still goes up. In addition, many outside factors can affect the cost and range of benefits, making it impossible to know how Medicare Advantage might change. While the statement from Cornilles is partially accurate, it is taken out of context and ignores important details on a politically volatile subject. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08676	"There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by ... Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-there-have-been-more-terrorist-at/	Just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Ann Coulter, the often provocative conservative pundit, wrote a column in which she compared the number of terrorist attacks in the United States under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Coulter was challenging the argument by Gen. David Petraeus -- the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan -- warning against a proposed Koran burning in Gainesville, Fla., on the grounds that, in Coulter's words, "it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans." Coulter wrote that "this is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting?" She went on to knock Andrew Sullivan, an iconoclastic conservative pundit, for suggesting that if Obama was elected, his racial background and life story could help counter jihadist recruiting efforts. "It didn't work out that way," Coulter wrote. "There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin (sic) had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the 'it will help them recruit' argument yet?" (For the record, she said she opposes [Koran]-burning, saying, "The reason not to burn [Korans] is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm.") Coulter raises a pertinent question about what the U.S. can actually do to curb recruiting by jihadists. But the only part of her comment that's checkable is her claim that "there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq." So we looked into it. We'll start by noting that Coulter's terminology is quite specific, leaving out a lot of terrorist activity that occurred under both presidents. She appears to be counting terrorist attacks (not foiled attacks or arrests before attacks were carried out or plots undertaken), and she is limiting her count to attacks on U.S. soil (leaving out attacks against U.S. interests in other countries). She also starts the clock after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which means excluding the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two. Among the other incidents excluded by Coulter's parameters are the December 2001 "shoe-bombing" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes and the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians. Both cases were reportedly motivated to one degree or another by radical Islam. After looking through several sources, including reports by the FBI and independent commissions, we conclude that there were no Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks fitting Coulter's strict definition under Bush. As for the record under Obama, we found two that fit Coulter's categories. One was the attack at Ft. Hood in Texas on Nov. 5, 2009, which left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military doctor and suspected Islamic extremist, has been charged in the shooting. The other attack at a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark., June 1, 2009, left one soldier dead and one wounded. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad has been charged with being the gunman in that incident. Using Coulter's criteria means excluding at least two well-publicized incidents that took place during Obama's tenure -- the foiled Dec. 25, 2009, attempt to bomb a plane landing in Detroit by alleged "underwear" bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and the failed Times Square attack of May 1, 2010, by alleged car-bomber Faisal Shahzad. So, Coulter's numbers may be meticulously circumscribed, but they're right: There were zero attacks during the six years cited under Bush, and two attacks in the first 16 months under Obama. But terrorism experts told us that the more important question is what those statistics signify. The answer may be: not much. In large part, that's because terrorist attacks often take years to plan. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, noted that Najibullah Zazi -- who plotted simultaneous suicide attacks on the NYC subway a year ago -- made contact with and was trained by al-Qaida in 2008. So he began his planning under Bush but was arrested under Obama, Hoffman said. The same goes for many of the Somali-Americans who went to Somalia for terrorist training as far back as 2006 and 2007 but only got onto the authorities' radar screen in 2009. In fact, experts we spoke to agreed that it's unlikely that the terrorists and alleged terrorists in question even gave any thought to who was serving as president when planning their attacks. Someone who takes the fateful step of starting to plan a deadly attack against U.S. citizens isn't likely to be swayed in their views by mere changes in partisan control; they have become fundamentally opposed to the underlying foundation of American society. "Islamist terrorism exists not because of what we do but because of what its practitioners believe and because of the policies of the states that support it," said Ted Bromund, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Bromund called it "solipsism" -- that is, extreme self-centeredness -- for any American to assume that our own short- to medium-term actions will have much of an impact on jihadist recruiting. "Islamists have their own ideology, and states like Iran have their own interests, which are not simply a mirror reflection of us and our actions," Bromund said. "Therefore, we should carry out policies that are in accord with our interests and values and not fall into the habit of believing that the problems of the world are really all about us." This view actually fits pretty well with the broader point Coulter was trying to make, which is that individual incidents and events aren't likely to have much of an impact on terrorist recruiting. Reviewing the evidence, Coulter's numbers are correct -- there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil under Obama than under Bush. But this statistic is of questionable value. It's based on carefully constructed parameters that could have produced a different comparison if those parameters had been tweaked. It suggests that terrorist plots can be blamed on a specific presidency, even though plots can take years to come together. And it suggests that the only way to measure success in combating terrorism is by comparing deadly attacks on U.S. soil, even though "it's immensely relevant whether someone has become motivated to attack U.S. persons or interests anywhere in the world, including Afghanistan and Iraq," said Robert Chesney, a law professor and terrorism specialist at the University of Texas. Ultimately, we think the statement is accurate but doesn't provide needed context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00221	Says Washington’s Kim Schrier has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes and put your care "in the hands of government bureaucrats."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/national-republican-congressional-committee/washingtons-kim-schrier-no-bernie-sanders-nor-her-/	"Medicare for All" is today’s catch phrase for government supported, single-payer health care, and if you’re a free-market Republican, that can sound like a path toward socialism. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician in Washington state who’s running for Congress, uttered that phrase, and Republicans in the other Washington (D.C.) even have it on videotape. "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system," Schrier said. The video clip, with suspenseful music added for emphasis, is part of an ad put out by the National Republican Campaign Committee, or NRCC, an arm of the Republican Party that supports Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The NRCC supports Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator, in the race for the open seat in Washington’s 8th Congressional District, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs across the Cascades. Medicare for All, the Republican ad says, would mean "your employer-based health coverage" would be "eliminated. Your income tax could double. Kim Schrier’s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for Washington families. Washington can’t afford Kim Schrier in Congress." We could approach this by asking whether "Medicare for All" would do this, as we’ll do briefly. But another question arises: Does Schrier really have a plan like this? Let’s see. Definitions Medicare for All can mean different things. In its broadest sense, it means that the country would get rid of the current system of multiple health insurers vying for your or your employer’s premiums. Instead, the government would build on an existing taxpayer-supported system: Medicare, the federal program that already covers seniors age 65 and older. It does not mean the government would pick your doctor or hospital. Instead, the government would set or negotiate payment rates to providers, and you’d go to the doctor of your choice. The costs and many other details for such a system are in debate, with critics saying that even a doubling of all individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient. Supporters say the savings in health care premiums and administrative costs would balance this out, and one proposed bill in the House — a bill with 123 co-sponsors, all Democrats — would raise taxes on the incomes of the top 5 percent of earners and on stock and bond transactions. (For a fuller look at this, check out PolitiFact’s annotated checks of an op-ed by President Donald Trump, who called Medicare for All part of Democrats’ "radical agenda.") But there are variations on this idea within Congress. One set of proposals would let you or your employer keep the insurance you have but, alternatively, let you buy coverage in the Medicare system if you wanted. Another set of proposals would only open Medicare to individuals and small employers, keeping large-employer insurance largely unchanged. And yet another would allow Medicare buy-in only to people age 50 or 55. Each one of these variations has been introduced in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy side-by-side comparison of eight of these bills. What Schrier wants On her campaign website, Schrier says "quality health care is a fundamental human right," and that is why she says she wants Medicare for All — but not yet. It will take time, she says, because it will take a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass, and then more time to implement. For now, she says, Congress should allow a voluntary buy-in. "Too many Washingtonians face skyrocketing healthcare costs, and we need to take immediate steps to help them get the coverage they need and deserve," her website says. "That’s why I am committed to moving us toward a Medicare for All system that guarantees affordable, high-quality care for every American. Medicare has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to deliver high-quality care. "But we cannot simply wait for a Democratic president and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass a bill that will take years to implement. In the meantime, we need to take immediate action to stabilize our insurance market and build on the ACA (Affordable Care Act) in the short term and implement a Medicare public option immediately, as we work toward a universal system." Schrier’s Medicare buy-in would be handled through state health care exchanges -- the Affordable Care Act marketplaces -- with private individual and small-group plans offered as well. Prices would be based on a sliding scale, with subsidies available for the neediest. Tale of the tape The video clip in the NRCC ad comes directly from Schrier’s campaign website’s video. But there are major differences. The NRCC added scary music and cut off Schrier right after she said, "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system." The full video is more than 12 minutes long. And right after mentioning Medicare for All, Schrier says, "But I see patients and what they are going through, and we do not have the luxury of waiting until we have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president to get Medicare for All. We need to take action right away." She then lays out her "buy-in, public option" plan. So on what does the NRCC base its claim that Schrier would eliminate your employer coverage, put "your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats" and require "historic tax increases?" The ad gives citations on the screen. The part about employer coverage cites a 2017 New York Times analysis on the proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for single-payer health care. "The employer-based insurance that now covers 156 million people would be eliminated," the Times story said. "Those people would lose their current coverage and be enrolled in the new program instead." For the possible doubling of taxes, the screen cites an Associated Press story from July, which said, "Sen. Bernie Sanders’ ‘Medicare for All’ plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes, says a study released Monday by a university-based libertarian policy center." This is a study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Sanders disputes the high-end cost. The New York Times’ and other analyses have said there would be trade-offs, because people could spend less on health care and premiums. As for the government’s control, the ad’s screen cites a July story in The Hill. The article was about comments from Seema Verma, Trump’s administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare. "By choosing a socialized system, you are giving the government complete control over the decisions pertaining to your care or whether you receive care at all," Verma said in a speech in San Francisco, as the article reported. Not her plan The NRCC’s claims about Schrier assume she wants a Medicare for All program similar to the one promoted by Sanders and a number of House members. Schrier doesn’t specify anyone’s single proposal but says Medicare for All is desirable in the long term -- but unrealistic for now. So when would she want it? We asked her campaign, and spokeswoman Katie Rodihan answered without giving a date because, she said, Schrier isn’t even promoting that kind of plan. "Dr. Schrier's plan specifically does not eliminate employer-based coverage, does not require an income tax increase, does not give the government ‘complete control,’ and does not require historic tax increases," Rodihan said in an email. She added that the bill the ad seems to cite "is Bernie Sanders' plan, not Kim Schrier's," and that "Kim does not" support it. "The fact is that Kim has her own plan that is separate and distinct from Medicare for All." Our ruling The NRCC says "Kim Schrier’s Medicare for All plan" would eliminate employer-provided health coverage, "put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases." It is true that Schrier said, "Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system," but she then said a lot more, and the ad ignores it all, instead citing criticisms of a specific plan she doesn’t support (and those criticisms themselves are in dispute). Her plan would make Medicare available to all -- all who chose it, that is. The day may come when a Sanders-like plan is viable and politically realistic, but Schrier made clear that since that day is not now, she is focused elsewhere. We rate the claim Mostly False.

The headline on a May 6, 2017, post on ConservativeFlashNews.com read, "Malia Obama arrested with a gang of thugs in Chicago." The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds. The post said Obama and the men were at an unnamed park in Chicago, and were charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance. Obama had been forbidden by her famous parents from going to any such party, the story said, but disappeared before turning up at the police station. This didn’t happen, of course, because the story is fake. It turned up on a few other websites around May 6. But it actually originated on May 5 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately tried to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake -- this Malia Obama post is just the latest example. A previous story from TheLastLineOfDefense.org said Malia Obama had been expelled from Harvard University for smoking marijuana in Boston, despite the fact that she hadn’t even been enrolled at the school. As for the fake accomplices pictured in the story, the image is taken from a series of mugshots showing a group of eight men arrested in Florence County, S.C., in 2013 for running a dogfighting ring. Malia’s image was inserted to suggest she’d been partying with the other seven. But that’s not the case. As far as we know, the 18-year-old is still enjoying her gap year before enrolling at Harvard this fall. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

A post on viralactions.com, headlined, "80% of black men in Atlanta are Homosexuals, study says," claims that Georgia State University students "began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results." The study divided the population into the categories "black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual," said the Jan. 7, 2016 post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post also claimed that the percentage of gay black men in Atlanta is expected to be much higher "due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society." We did not find a Georgia State University study concluding that 80 percent of black men in Atlanta are gay. We did find social media accounts linked to viralactions.com that made it clear that its information is not factual. Viralactions.com’s website doesn’t feature a page describing its mission or who’s behind it, and to anyone visiting the site, there’s no easy way to tell if it’s stories are real or not. But it does link to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook accounts that suggest its content is fake. The website linked to an Instagram page for the username "folksrtalking," with a biographical description claiming to have "3 BILLION satire article views shared & counting from over 50 blogs! You may not know my name but you definitely seen my work if your on the Net! #IZM." Its Twitter page, also for the username @FolksRtalking, said "Folks don't want to be INFORMED they want to be ENTERTAINED. #InfoTainment News at its Finest! #NYC." The Twitter account links to another website, celebtricity.com, which describes itself as "the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world.

TmzWorldstar appears to be part of a web of hoax websites recycling and cross-posting fabricated information. Fellow fact-checkers at Snopes.com in February 2016 deemed as false claims that a study found that 80 percent of black men in Georgia were gay. The story debunked by Snopes in 2016 is the same one that has resurfaced on Viralactions.com.

pomt-04179	Says, "In the last four years we’ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/15/sam-adams/did-sam-adams-cut-36-million-budget/	PolitiFact Oregon has been around government budgets long enough to know that they’re hard to decipher. There are add-on packages and inflationary costs, general fund dollars and one-time dollars and all-funds budgets. Numbers by themselves don’t mean much without context. So, naturally, our ears perked right up when Portland Mayor Sam Adams made this statement in a budget work session shortly after the Nov. 6 election: "In the last four years we’ve cut $36 million in ongoing revenue." He also tweeted the number Nov. 13and used it again in a year end-interview with the Portland Mercury. Sounds gloomy, right? But remember, this is the same mayor who once hooted about a one-time $22 million budget surplus in February 2011, and we found that claim to be Half True. So we wanted to know more about these dollar "cuts." We decided to give his statement the full Truth-O-Meter treatment. We were aided by one of The Oregonian’s Portland City Hall reporters, who immediately pointed out that the $36 million was really closer to $25.6 million because the city had added $10.3 million for new programs over the same period. In other words, Adams had to "cut" as much as he did because he chose to spend money elsewhere. Apparently this was not news to anyone at the budget meeting because Andrew Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, clicked through a PowerPoint presentation with a slide that outlined $25.6 million in "ongoing shortfall" and $10.3 million in new program additions. Now, we bet you’re asking for the definition of an "ongoing shortfall." Government budgets don’t stay flat, obviously. The cost of maintaining the same programs goes up every year, sometimes beyond the cost of inflation, whether due to increases in demand for services or steep hikes in health and retirement benefits. When projected revenue falls short of dollars needed to maintain services, that’s the shortfall. State and local governments can’t print money like the federal government, so they have to fix the shortfall by raising revenue (usually taxes) or cutting services, pay, etc. Elected officials may always choose to add new programs. But if they don’t have enough money, they have to reduce or eliminate other programs. We call that making choices; we could even call that "budgeting." We’ve called out politicians previously for talking about "budget cuts" when government has had more money than the year before, just not enough to cover a shortfall and pay for new programs. We also bet you’re asking for some hard numbers. The city’s total annual budget is in the $3.5 billion range, but Adams is talking about the much smaller amount known as the general fund. The general fund includes property taxes and business license fees, but does not include gas taxes, sewer and stormwater charges or water fees. The numbers vary, depending on how you slice them, from $349.5 million to $472 million in 2009-10, to 352.5 million to $490 million for 2012-13.. But no matter how you look at the numbers, if you compare apples to apples, the figures today are higher, even slightly, than what they were in 2009-10, with ups and downs along the way. In other words, today’s budget is not $36 million less than the 2009-10 budget, which is what the average person probably thinks when the mayor says that he has "cut $36 million in ongoing revenue." Scott, the city’s financial planning manager, disapproves of our simplistic way of looking at numbers. He says that you can’t compare dollars to dollars because that doesn’t account for steep growth in government costs, such as participation in the Public Employees Retirement System or health insurance. The cost of running government doesn’t stay the same from year to year. He’s right about that, but taxpayers and non-wonks don’t live in a world where buying everything you did the previous year, even if it costs more, is considered spending the same in dollars. Had Adams just said the city had cut services, he’d be on more solid ground. Of course, he’d also have to mention that the city had added services. But that’s not what the mayor said either. He stated $36 million in ongoing cuts. That’s not true, even if his spokeswoman stands by the statement. His statement contains some connection to reality: The city has not been able to spend $36 million that it needed to maintain current services over the four years. Part of the reason is because the mayor and council chose instead to spend $10 million on other programs. The remaining $25 million was based on an expectation of maintaining the status quo. We rate the statement False.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-12-15T06:00:00	2012-11-13	['None']
pomt-00398	If Missouri Amendment 1 passes, the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/05/saundra-mcdowell/mcdowell-claims-missouri-amendment-1-would-adjoin-/	If November ballot measure Amendment 1 passes, municipalities such as St. Louis and Joplin could be smushed into one district, according to Saundra McDowell, Republican candidate for state auditor. During an interview on "The Weekend Report" radio show, published online Aug. 20, McDowell, who is running against Democratic incumbent Nicole Galloway, said Amendment 1 would require all new voting districts to be 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat. To do that, the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch," she said, even adding later in the interview that "this will happen." As states nationwide seek solutions for gerrymandering, Missouri is doing the same with Amendment 1, which would put the power of redrawing state voting districts into the hands of a non-partisan expert picked from a list curated by the auditor's office. The amendment also seeks to rid lobbyist gifts from the Missouri General Assembly and to keep legislative records public, among other stipulations. It is authored by Clean Missouri, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of lobbyists and corporations. It has attracted attacks from many politicians, including McDowell. Given the strikingly different claims from Amendment 1 proponents and McDowell's surprising assertion about non-contiguity, we decided to assess her contention. The McDowell campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment, noting that she doesn't intend to take media interviews for approximately 60 days as of Aug. 27. Who has power over redistricting? In the statement, McDowell claims that the auditor's office would have overwhelming control over the redistricting process, adding that the auditor’s office "could literally change the entire demographics of Missouri." She said earlier in the interview that Democrats back Amendment 1 so that Galloway can bend the maps in favor of her party. Amendment 1 language gives the auditor's office just one role: making a list of potential non-partisan demographers from state residents who apply. From that list, the state Senate's majority and minority leaders would have to agree on one or accept a random lottery after each leader removes a third of the list. After the demographer draws up the maps, state legislative commissions can make any changes to it after holding a public hearing. Benjamin Singer, communications director for Clean Missouri, said there was no language in the amendment specifying which part of the government the demographer works in, such as the auditor's office. Must districts be contiguous? The question of whether St. Louis and "a southwest Missouri Republican district" could become a district without their borders touching is answered in the amendment, sort of. Section 3 says new districts "shall be composed of contiguous territory. Areas which meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous." Edward Greim, a lawyer who specializes in constitutional and election law, filed a lawsuit in August to remove Amendment 1 from the ballot. The lawsuit will be decided upon by a judge as early as this week. Greim said that on the surface, this language gives more teeth to contiguity than the current law. But Greim said a loophole in the same section of the amendment prioritizes fairer dispersal of Republicans and Democrats in an area over contiguity. The phrase in question is that contiguity is "subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)." "Now, they only need to be composed (of contiguous districts) if you have met A and B," Greim said. So if A and B can only be met without contiguity, then contiguity becomes moot, Greim said. Ruth Greenwood, a redistricting attorney from Campaign Legal Center, said "subject to" simply means one requirement has a lower priority than another. "It would ultimately be up to the court to interpret the text," she said. Do districts need to be half-Republican and half-Democrat? Context is essential to McDowell's statement, as she said that non-contiguity is required because every district has to be close to 50 percent Republican and Democratic. But the amendment's requirement that any shift in the statewide electorate reflect a substantially proportionate shift in the state legislature would not be met if that was the case. The amendment also requires the map to be drawn based on voting numbers from the sum of all districts. In other words, Greenwood said, the map can't be drawn solely on a district-by-district basis. Why? Because a big goal of the amendment is to reduce the "efficiency gap" in votes. The statistic measures the difference in the number of votes that don't contribute to a win. After all, everything above 50 percent is not necessary. This would fight gerrymandering methods, where the goal is to increase the opposition party's so-called "wasted votes" while decreasing one party's own. What matters is not how red or blue a certain district is, but how "efficient" votes are being translated to representation. With the Clean Missouri model, not every district has to be "50-50," as potential voting maps of other states have demonstrated. Rather, it simply seeks to reduce the disproportionate representation of the party in power. Our ruling McDowell said that if Amendment 1 is enacted, the auditor's office will necessitate non-contiguous voting districts. Specifically, she said the auditor's office "could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch." Her sentiment is too broad and mostly unfounded. Because the auditor's office does not have complete control over drawing districts, and Amendment 1 is not trying to make every district is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, McDowell's allegation of non-contiguous voting districts becomes more dubious. Her supposed saving grace — "subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)"— is highly debatable and best left up to legal parsing. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-09116	Thurbert Baker kept a teen in jail "who didn't even commit a felony."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/18/concernedcitizen4u/video-uses-obama-speech-attack-baker/	What's the best way for someone to undermine a Democrat in a primary campaign? A video clip of Barack Obama bashing the candidate is a good start. Someone who is apparently not a fan of Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, a Democratic gubernatorial contender, created a professional-looking YouTube video attacking him. It begins with a picture of Baker with the "Ghostbusters" symbol. "Thurbert Baker for Governor?" reads the headline on the video, created June 10. Baker's position in the controversial Genarlow Wilson case is the focus of the three-minute video posted by "concernedcitizen4u". The video also includes civil rights stalwarts the Revs. Joseph Lowery and Al Sharpton taking Baker to task. Baker is in a crowded Democratic field seeking that party's nomination to become the state's next leader. To win, or at least get in a runoff, a Democratic candidate must capture a significant portion of the state's African-American vote. Blacks make up about half the Democratic voter base in Georgia. Baker is black. The other leading Democratic candidates are white. Whoever posted the video -- and at this point that person or political campaign remains unknown -- apparently is trying to undermine Baker's support in the black community by using a 3-year-old statement by the man who is now president of the United States. Then-candidate Obama assailed Baker for pursuing the case against Wilson, who is also black. This is a stealth political attack at its lethal best. Brutally blunt, it focuses on a target audience and is virtually untraceable. But is it true? The Baker camp said no. "This isn't the first time a false attack has been spread anonymously ... and it won't be the last," Baker campaign manager Jeff DiSantis said. "It's a pack of lies." Wilson, you may remember, was convicted in 2005 of felony aggravated child molestation for what he said was consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl. Wilson was 17 at the time of the incident and faced 10 years in prison after he was convicted. Some activists suggested prosecutors treated Wilson harshly because he is black. The accusations of racial discrimination, added to a story about sex, generated national news coverage. In 2006, the state Legislature changed the law to make similar acts between teens a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 12 months in prison. The changes, however, did not apply to Wilson and anyone else already imprisoned on such charges. So he remained in prison. Not fair, Obama said. The Democrat referred to the Wilson case in several speeches in 2007 during his run for president. Obama compared Wilson's case to I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the former chief of staff to Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. President George W. Bush decided to commute Libby's sentence after he was convicted of perjury and obstruction in a CIA leak case. "You've got Scooter Libby not serving any jail time. But you've got a young man, a football player who didn't even commit a felony, who's being locked up for 10 years, then it's harder for you to say you stand up for justice in America," Obama said in one campaign speech that was recorded. The crowd cheered. The video ends with audio replaying some of Obama's speech. "It's harder for you to say you stand for justice in America." Video of the future president questioning your commitment to justice can't be good for Baker in a Democratic primary. The video does not say when Obama's remarks were recorded. But an Atlanta Journal-Constitution account of Obama's visit to Atlanta in August 2007 said he made comments about Libby and Wilson at that time. There's one problem with Obama's comments. State law 16-6-4 said at the time of Wilson's conviction that aggravated child molestation was a felony. Monroe County Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson (no relation to Genarlow) ruled in June 2007 that the case was a misdemeanor and that Genarlow Wilson should be freed. Baker appealed the ruling, saying Judge Wilson overstepped his authority. The attorney general said at the time he was worried the ruling had the potential to allow other convicted child molesters to be freed. Baker was quoted in the AJC as saying he thought the 10-year sentence was "harsh." But, Baker also said: "I took an oath to uphold the laws of this state. And in taking that oath, I don't have the luxury of taking the law into my own hands or picking which cases to defend." The Georgia Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in October 2007 that Genarlow Wilson should be freed. We tried to reach "concernedcitizen4u", but our efforts have been unsuccessful. People who watch the video may get the wrong impression about the case. Wilson was indeed convicted of a felony. So Obama's comments about the case in 2007 were incorrect. We believe the video is misleading and rule that this item is False.	None	Concernedcitizen4U	None	None	None	2010-06-18T06:00:00	2010-06-10	['None']
pomt-10554	"I have something in common with my husband. He never carried caucuses either. He lost all of the ones that I've lost."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/13/hillary-clinton/both-caucus-losers-but-shes-more-thorough/	Trying to brush off some of her recent defeats, Sen. Hillary Clinton compared her battle with Sen. Barack Obama to Bill Clinton's presidential travails, noting that he, too, had a tendency to perform lousy in caucuses. "I have something in common with my husband. He never carried caucuses either. He lost all of the ones that I've lost," she said in a Feb. 11, 2008, ABC/Politico interview. Misery may love company, but the New York senator is stretching facts a bit to draw comparisons with the self-proclaimed "Comeback Kid." That's partly because some states have switched their selection processes between primaries, in which voters cast statewide ballots for the nominee of their choice, and the older caucus system, in which voters meet at the precinct level to decide a winner, sometimes under complicated rules. It's true that Bill Clinton lost all the states that Hillary Clinton has lost among those states that held caucuses in both 1992 and 2008. Those are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota and Washington. Hillary Clinton also lost primaries in Delaware and Utah — states that in 1992 held caucuses that Bill Clinton lost. And she lost the caucus in Colorado, a state whose primary Bill Clinton couldn't carry 16 years ago. On the other hand, she won the Nevada caucus that her husband lost in 1992. The couple's fortunes also differed in several states that have changed their nominating processes. Hillary Clinton lost caucuses in Kansas, Nebraska and North Dakota, which each held primaries in 1992 that Bill Clinton won. She won the primary in Arizona, a state Bill Clinton was unable to carry when it held a caucus in 1992. As an incumbent president in 1996, Bill Clinton didn't have to sweat intraparty battles and coasted to the party nomination unopposed. It's hard to read too much into comparisons like the one Hillary Clinton cites because the political complexions of some states — particularly in the West — have changed markedly over the past 16 years. So, too, has the nature of campaigning — and the way the 24/7 spin cycle affects groups of voters. Safe to say, both Clintons do better in big states that hold primaries. For this reason, we rule Hillary Clinton's claim Mostly True. UPDATE: We have updated this item to show that Nevada held a caucus this year, not a primary.

pomt-02410	"We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."	false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-record-funding-environmental-prot/	So we know Gov. Rick Scott likes to portray himself as the jobs-promoter-in-chief but what about tree-hugger-in-chief? During his fourth State of the state speech March 4, Scott began by reeling off a list of recent accomplishments. "A lot has happened since I spoke to you last year. I can talk about how our unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 percent. How our crime rate is at a 42-year low. How we have invested record funding in protecting our environment....." Some of those numbers sounded familiar to us. But we hadn’t heard Scott’s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment, so we decided to fact-check that claim. Funding to restore springs We asked Scott’s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure Florida had invested record funding on environmental protection. Spokesman John Tupps told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Scott was referring to his proposed budget that includes a "record $55 million" to protect and restore springs -- "building upon last year’s investment of more than $37 million." Funding for springs is only a subset of funding for environmental protection, but we’ll look at the status of springs funding first. As of early March, the Legislature hadn’t voted on the amount for springs protection. It’s possible the Legislature will set an even higher amount: A coalition of Senate committee chairs drafted a bill to raise $400 million for springs from documentary stamp taxes on real estate transactions. The state has more than 1,000 freshwater springs, and many are suffering from nitrate pollution that fuels the growth of toxic algae blooms. Geologists have found an increase in saltiness in a few freshwater springs, which could signal future problems with the state's drinking supply, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In 2013, the state asked water management districts for a list of projects essential to springs restoration and received a list of about $122 million. The Legislature set aside $10 million, but the total climbed to $37 million, once other sources including local government money was included. "If the Legislature passes Gov. Scott’s $55 million springs recommendation it will be a record level of spending for Florida’s springs," Eric Draper, Executive Director Audubon Florida, told PolitiFact Florida. Annual DEP funding Though Scott’s spokesman said he was referring to money proposed for springs protection, his claim was more broadly about the environment, so we asked the Department of Environmental Protection, called DEP, for the bottom-line budget total for each year during Scott’s tenure. We found similar figures back to 2004, during the tenure of his predecessors, Govs. Charlie Crist Jeb Bush. Here is the bottom line total each year: 2004-05: $2.1 billion 2005-06: $2 billion 2006-07: $2.9 billion 2007-08: $2.4 billion 2008-09: $2 billion 2009-10: $1.3 billion 2010-11: $1.4 billion 2011-12: $1.8 billion 2012-13: $1.4 billion 2013-14: $1.3 billion These numbers come with some caveats: they are appropriation numbers, not actual expenditures, and they combine state and federal dollars. In several of those years, the numbers included debt service payments of more than $400 million. It’s no surprise that the dollar amounts were higher in flush financial times under Bush and part of Crist’s term and then plummeted along with the economy in the second half of Crist’s tenure and Scott’s tenure. We have seen the same pattern for other state spending priorities. Spokespersons for DEP and Scott also cited other environmental projects Scott has supported -- including an $880 million water quality plan to provide clean water to the Everglades. Facing the prospect of court-ordered cleanup, in 2012 the state reached a settlement with the federal government to end a long-standing dispute about Everglades cleanup. All of the $880 million won’t be spent this year; it is a 13-year agreement. For this year, Scott proposed $130 million for Everglades, which includes part of that $880 million, as well as other state and water management district sources. "Scott has skillfully negotiated the Everglades deal with EPA, which gives him a talking point of boosting environmental programs in Florida," said Jerry Phillips, a DEP attorney in the 1990s who is now an environmental watchdog. "But the reality is that Bush and Crist had been negotiating with EPA for years as well, on issues such as the Everglades." Environmental cuts The total DEP budget doesn’t tell the full story because other agencies also do work that relates to protecting the environment. We interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to Scott’s lack of investment in protecting the environment. We will cite some of their examples: • In 2011 Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties. • In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. The South Florida Water Management District’s total budget dropped from about $1 billion in 2011 to $622 million in 2014. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues. • In December 2012, DEP laid off 58 employees. • The number of enforcement cases handled by DEP has dropped dramatically, from 2,289 in 2010 (Crist’s final year) to 799 in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times reported. As of the end of May, only 145 new cases had been filed. • For many years the Legislature invested $300 million a year in Florida Forever, a program to buy land with money from a tax on real estate transactions. During the economic downturn, the Legislature pulled back. In 2010, Crist’s final year, the program received $15 million. In 2011, Scott proposed zeroing out Florida Forever (it ultimately got $744,000), and then in 2012 he signed a budget that included about $8 million. In 2013, lawmakers approved $20 million and directed the state to sell off $50 million worth of land to generate additional dollars. In March, DEP scrapped the program without selling an acre. Scott has proposed $70 million for next year -- that includes $40 million from the sale of non-conservation lands. Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida, said Scott’s claim is "disconcerting" because of the various cuts. "You have to take all that into account when you run budget numbers," he said. "It sounds to me like Scott’s people are coming up with their own selective set of budget figures. ... He doesn’t have environmental creds as far as I am concerned." Our ruling During his State of the State speech Scott said, "We have invested record funding in protecting our environment." After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott’s statement during the speech likely left listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either. Scott tried to take his spending recommendation for one particular environmental project -- springs restoration -- and portray that as an overall record, and that’s not the case.

pomt-08344	Says Republican candidates in Oregon are "advocating violence" against gays.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/28/basic-rights-oregon/basic-rights-oregon-tries-tie-one-pollsters-anti-g/	Campaign donation requests say the darndest things. Take, for instance, a fresh-off-the-keyboard e-mail received from the Basic Rights Equality PAC -- the political finance arm of Basic Rights Oregon -- that ties the views of one pollster to those of the Senate Republicans. First, the e-mail starts by quoting from a Willamette Week article: "It’s hard to believe. But there it was in bold print in ‘Willamette Week’: an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans ‘advocates death for gays.’ " The e-mail continues, making some assertions of its own: "It’s shocking that candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence." Indeed, it is shocking. That’s why PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. As a basis for their claim, Basic Right Oregon points to the Willamette Week article, which reported on "an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans" and his alleged extreme anti-gay views. A quick Google search, and we had before us the article with the perfectly provocative headline "Republican Pollster In Oregon Says Slaves ‘Well-Treated’; Advocates Death for Gays." According to the article, state filings showed that the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans had paid thousands of dollars to Target Market Strategies for polling over the past few years. Senate Democrats pounced when they learned that Dennis Oliver Woods, the "company principal" of Target Market Strategies, had published a book that included the following passages: "Some crimes are such a violent assault on the image of God in man or on biblical society that God stipulates that nothing less than death will satisfy His offended sense of justice." And then this one: "In addition to murder (see Lev. 24:17), the death penalty is specified for a number of crimes. This is the ultimate form of restitution. These crimes include promotion of witchcraft…Bestiality (see Lev. 20:15), homosexuality (see Lev. 20:13), incest and adultery ..." We decided to give Woods a call directly to discuss his views. He wouldn’t chat with us but instead sent us an e-mail that didn’t do much to address what he actually thought. "My point of view is really irrelevant now since the Senate Republican caucus has dismissed me and I am no longer working for them," he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon wrote him back, asking for clarification. He never responded. To learn more, we got our hands on a copy of his book, "Discipling the Nations," from which all this was excerpted. The book says that "Part III," the section excerpted in Willamette Week, "offers God’s Blueprint for Civil Government. Chapter 7 holds forth the Word of God as the only adequate rule for civil government." Michael Gay, the spokesman for the Senate Republicans, says they did not know about Woods’ book, which was published more than 10 years ago and is not widely distributed. They have since stopped using his services. "He served no advisory function to the caucus whatsoever," Gay said. "He was merely a vendor who made phone calls. "We wrote the poll questions, we told him what to ask, he was scripted." Maya Blackmun, a spokeswoman for Basic Rights Oregon, argues, "(I)t's common knowledge that on political campaigns pollsters are a key player in advising and consulting on a campaign, interpreting results, providing cross tab analysis, targeting profiles, connecting messages with key audiences, etc." Even if Woods does believe in the death penalty for gays and even if he was an adviser to the Senate Republicans, Basic Rights Oregon asserted that Republican candidates are "blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence." PolitiFact Oregon finds no evidence of this claim. Certainly, no member of the Republican Senate caucus has spoken in support of Woods’ views or said anything remotely similar. Blackmun concedes that the e-mail could have done with a bit of editing. It would have been fairer, she said, had the e-mail read something to the effect of "it’s shocking that an adviser to candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay." "We made a mistake," Blackmun said. "The additional words would have made it clearer." We find the claim that Senate Republicans are advocating violence against gays False. Comment on this story.

pomt-13757	Says that as a U.S. senator, Russ Feingold "voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/22/ron-johnson/gop-national-convention-ron-johnson-attacks-challe/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson used part of his July 19, 2016, speech at the Republican National Convention to boost his re-election campaign, attacking challenger and ex-senator Russ Feingold for voting "against authorizing our military 11 separate times." It’s a claim we want to check, given that Johnson made it in the context of arguing that electing Feingold would made America less safe. But first a little on how the Wisconsin Republican got there. The attack Johnson opened his speech in Cleveland with this greeting: "Ladies and gentleman, what difference, at this point, does it make?" It was a shot at Hillary Clinton. While secretary of state, Clinton uttered that phrase to him during a Senate hearing on the bombing of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans died in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. (Our In Context on Clinton’s remarks is one of our most-clicked items. And PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True another claim from the speech in which Johnson took credit for inducing Clinton’s comments.) After criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Johnson continued his speech by warning of dangers posed by terrorism if Democrats win in the November 2016 elections. Then he pivoted to attacking Feingold, a Democrat who served three terms in the Senate before Johnson defeated him in 2010. "So, the question is, when will America actually confront this terrible reality. We certainly won’t, if Democrats win in November," Johnson said. "In Wisconsin, I’m running against Russ Feingold, a man who even after 9/11, was the only senator to vote against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his 18-year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times." During his current campaign, Feingold has defended, and raised money on, casting the only vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. He said the law "gave the federal government way too much power to spy on people without adequate oversight." But in the context of Johnson’s remarks about terrorism and being tough on defense, what does it mean that Feingold "voted against authorizing our military"? In short, Johnson is making an attack that is broader than a claim about 11 votes. Understanding the NDAA To back Johnson’s statement, which is also made in a Johnson TV ad, his campaign staff cited 11 instances in which Feingold voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. But here are two key points made by three experts on defense budgets about NDAA votes: 1. The annual NDAA contains thousands of pages and hundreds of provisions, which means a lawmaker might vote against it for any number of reasons. Some lawmakers think it doesn’t authorize enough funds, others might think it authorizes too much; or a no vote could come from opposition to a policy in the bill, such as gays in the military or moving detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. "Even if you’re the biggest proponent of a strong defense, you could find something to object to in the NDAA almost every year," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank. 2. The NDAA authorizes funds, but it doesn’t provide any. Money is actually allocated through a separate appropriations process. So, voting no on an NDAA would not result in any shutdown, like voting no on appropriations could. Indeed, some federal agencies operate for years without an authorization bill. "An authorization is just a license to hunt, it doesn’t actually bag you a deer," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a public spending watchdog group. We also found that although Feingold sometimes was among only a small number of Democrats voting against an NDAA, often he was joined by conservative Republicans: 1993: 22 senators voted no, including Republican stalwarts Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Vietnam war veteran John McCain of Arizona, the GOP’s 2008 presidential nominee. 1994: Feingold was joined by McCain and another war veteran, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP’s 1996 president nominee, voting no. 2009: Feingold was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the NDAA. But 28 Republicans, including conservative stalwarts such as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the current Senate majority leader, and Jeff Sessions of Arizona, also voted no. Feingold has given different reasons for his no votes. In 2008, for example, he said he supported a number of provisions in the NDAA, including a pay raise for troops and limiting the outsourcing of private security functions in war zones, but voted no because it contained "$70 billion to continue the war in Iraq but no language mandating that we safely redeploy our troops." It's also worth noting that Feingold did vote yes on a number of NDAAs, including in November 2005, June 2006 and December 2010, just before he left office. Our rating Johnson argued that Feingold would be weak on defense, and claimed that as a senator, Feingold "voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times." During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold did vote 11 times against the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues such as gays in the military. The 11 votes indicate a pretty clear pattern. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that appropriations bills provide funding. And experts told us conclusions can’t be drawn about why a lawmaker votes no on the NDAA, given that sometimes lawmakers oppose it because of certain policy provisions. Moreover, lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum, including ex-military conservative Republicans, have voted against it over the years. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5667d437-28d4-4b76-913a-c8e9cf079d5e	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-07-22T10:30:00	2016-07-19	['United_States', 'Russ_Feingold']
pomt-00541	"The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/18/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-income-inequality-widest-1920s/	Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the 2016 Democratic nomination has focused on the gap between rich and poor. Sanders recently tweeted that the income inequality is wider than it’s been in a long time -- a very long time. "The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s," Sanders tweeted from his @BernieSanders account on June 4, 2015, after his first campaign trip to Iowa. But is the inequality gap really that big? Intriguingly, Sanders’ tweet mirrors a statement made by someone on the far opposite end of the political spectrum: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In January, PolitiFact Texas fact-checked a claim by Cruz that "today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928." For that fact-check, a Cruz spokesman directed us to a report done by the Pew Research Center citing research from Emmanuel Saez, a University of California-Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. The report showed a database compiled by Pew that included the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries. The data compiled showed that 1928 and 2012 were the two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans earned the greatest share of the nation’s income. Here’s the chart, which lists, in descending order, the top 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income : Year Top 1% income share 1928 19.6 2012 19.34 1927 18.68 1916 18.57 1929 18.42 2007 18.33 1914 18.16 2006 18.06 1926 18.01 1913 17.96 2008 17.89 2005 17.68 1936 17.64 1917 17.6 1925 17.6 In other words, in 1928, the top 1 percent of taxpayers collectively held 19.6 percent of the nation’s income. In 2012, the top 1 percent held 19.34 percent of the nation’s income. So a recent year -- 2012 -- did rank second to 1928 on the list of biggest years for income inequality. But we’ll note two reasons for caution. First, other recent years did not rank as high on this list. While the years 2005 through 2008 ranked in the top 15, the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 did not. The Wall Street meltdown in 2008, which reduced incomes at the top of the spectrum as well as the bottom, may be a reason why. But this fact does offer some doubt about whether the 2012 result was more than a blip. Tax hikes that took effect in 2013 may have led taxpayers to time their liquidation of certain assets to avoid higher tax rates, said Saez, who with Thomas Piketty and others developed the underlying research. That suggests that 2012 could be an unusually high year, and experts say the increased taxation after 2013 could reduce how much of the nation’s income is held by the top 1 percent. The second caveat is that the method Saez used doesn’t fully account for all of the income sources that flow to those in the bottom 99 percent. The data used in his study looks at pre-tax, private income but doesn’t account for other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. Accounting for those factors in the calculation could produce a narrower income gap, although a full-blown study going back to the 1920s would be required to see whether the Saez method has produced an abnormal result. (Read the PolitiFact Texas fact-check for more detail.) Our ruling Sanders said, "The gap between the very rich and everyone else in America is wider today than at any time since the 1920s." One commonly used method supports that argument -- at least for one recent year, 2012. However, it’s worth noting that this method tends to widen income differences more than other approaches do. On balance, we rate Sanders’ statement Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-06-18T10:28:26	2015-06-04	['United_States']
pomt-00801	"In this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/02/bernie-sanders/checking-bernie-sanders-americans-low-voter-turnou/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and is considering running for president, recently decried the lack of Americans participating in the electoral process during a town hall at a union hall in Austin, Texas. During an appearance at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers-sponsored town hall on March 31, 2015, Sanders told the audience: "I beg of you do not enter that world of despair. We can win this fight. In order to win this struggle we are going to need nothing less than a political revolution, and let me tell you what I mean by ‘a political revolution.’ When, as was the case in this last election in November, when 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, when 80 percent of young people, when 75 percent of low-income workers, chose not to vote, what we need to do is create a momentum so that 70, 80, 90 percent of the people vote. And when that happens, we win hands down." It's a longstanding concern for Sanders, who has introduced a bill to make Election Day a national holiday so more people can vote. We wondered: Was Sanders right about the low level of voter participation? First, let’s look at the numbers. • "63 percent of the American people chose not to vote." Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist, has assembled the United States Election Project, an extensive and widely used archive of voter participation data. He found that in the November 2014 general election, 33.2 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot and 35.9 percent of the voting-eligible population voted. The difference between those two figures is that the voting-age population includes non-citizens and felons, neither of which are able to vote, whereas the voting-eligible population excludes these groups. If you flip the numbers so they are expressed as Sanders used them, 66.8 percent of the voting-age population didn’t vote, and 64.1 percent of the voting-eligible population didn’t vote. Using the latter figure -- which political scientists consider a better measurement -- Sanders is quite close. Incidentally, according to McDonald’s data, the overall turnout rate in 2014 was the lowest since World War II. • "80 percent of young people" did not vote. We found a study conducted by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University that had some relevant data for voters age 18-29. It estimated a turnout rate for that age group of 21.5 percent. That works out to a 78.5 percent non-participation rate -- close to the 80 percent Sanders cited. • "75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote." This is the claim for which Sanders has the weakest support. After each election cycle is over, the Census Bureau looks back at how many Americans of different demographic groups voted. The data isn’t yet compiled for the 2014 election, so we looked instead at the 2010 election -- the most recent midterm election prior to 2014. (In general, presidential-year elections see higher turnout across the board than midterms do, so using 2010 offers the best apples-to-apples comparison for 2014.) According to the 2010 data, those earning less than $30,000 a year -- the cutoff Sanders’ office told us he was using -- had a turnout rate of either 28.9 percent (if you use total population) or 34.6 percent (if you use citizens only). Flip those and you get 65 percent of citizens in that income category not voting, or 71 percent of everyone in that income category not voting. Those are both lower than Sanders’ claim of 75 percent, and for the more salient statistic -- citizens alone -- it’s off by a full 10 percentage points. (Jeff Frank, a Sanders spokesman, acknowledged that the statement was an estimate.) We should note that political scientists say that the census data may overstate actual voting rates, since it’s based on what respondents tell researchers, and there’s a widespread assumption that people over-report socially admired actions like voting. So it’s possible that Sanders’ 75 percent figure is closer to accurate. However, saying so requires speculating beyond the hard figures. To sum up, then: On the numbers, Sanders is quite close for turnout rates among Americans overall and among young people, but he’s a bit off for turnout rates for lower-income Americans. Did all of these people 'choose not to vote'? However, there’s another wrinkle to what Sanders said. Sanders twice used the phrasing "chose not to vote." In the same Census Bureau survey we mentioned earlier, researchers asked for the reason why people didn’t vote. It’s broken down by age and income, so we can check all three of Sanders’ claims against the data for 2010. We divided the stated reasons for not voting into two categories -- reasons of circumstance and reasons of choice. Under reasons of circumstance, we included "illness or disability," "out of town," "too busy/conflicting schedule," "transportation problems," "registration problems," "bad weather conditions," and "inconvenient polling places." Under reasons of choice, we included "forgot to vote," "not interested," and "did not like candidates or campaign issues." (We ignored "other" and "didn’t know.") Our division is not infallible -- others can combine the reasons into their own categories -- but we think our calculation offers a useful starting point for comparison. All three demographic groups Sanders mentioned turn out to have pretty similar breakdowns. For Americans overall, 55 percent didn’t vote for reasons of circumstance. For young Americans, it was 56 percent, and for low-income Americans, it was 52 percent. By contrast, the percentages of people not voting by choice were lower across the board. For Americans overall, it was 33 percent. For young Americans, it was 30 percent and for lower-income Americans it was 34 percent. This means that Sanders went too far when he said that large majorities chose not to vote. "It would be true to say that roughly an estimated 80 percent of youth did not vote in the 2014 midterm," said Abby Kiesa, youth coordinator and researcher at the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. "However, the existing research about youth voting does not suggest that all of those youth actively chose not to vote. In fact, young people in particular face barriers such as navigating a new system, that may prevent them from registering and voting, even if they do want to vote." This may have been an unintentional word choice on Sanders’ part, but at PolitiFact we pay close attention to speakers’ precise wording. Class differences in voting A final note: Sanders may have gotten some of his numbers wrong, but he does have a point that poorer Americans vote at lower rates than rich Americans do, as do younger Americans. "There is a class bias in voting," said Sean McElwee, a research associate with the think tank Demos. In 2010, for instance, the Census Bureau found that as 34.6 percent of citizens making below $30,000 were voting, a much higher percentage of those earning at least $150,000 voted -- 59 percent. Even taking into account the caveats in the data, McElwee said, "this is a disturbing gap." Our ruling Sanders said that "in this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote." Sanders was too loose with some of his numbers and his wording, but he has a point that rates of non-voting among Americans, and especially among younger and poorer Americans, are high.

pomt-14319	Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate is 20 percent.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-wisconsins-effective-unem/	At a campaign rally in Wisconsin on March 29, 2016, Donald Trump took aim at Gov. Scott Walker and -- reading from notes that he said came from "books" -- made a number of statistical claims that reflect negatively on the state. The Republican frontrunner for president cast blame on the Republican governor and onetime presidential candidate, citing figures on state government debt and the number of people on food stamps. But one of Trump’s most striking claims was about unemployment -- something Walker frequently takes credit for having brought down. "Unemployment rate -- well, they say -- that can't be possible," Trump told a crowd in Janesville, looking at his notes. "Unemployment rate, they have down 20, that can't be possible." As members of the audience interjected, Trump continued by saying: "What? Is it 20 percent? Effective or regular? I mean just -- effective unemployment rate, 20 percent. Hey, this is out of the big book." So, is Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate 20 percent? The measures There is no official measure for the effective -- or as Trump on other occasions called it -- the "real" unemployment rate. But even taking into account the federal government’s most expansive measure of unemployment, Wisconsin’s rate doesn’t even reach double digits. Here’s what the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us: BLS has six measures of unemployment, ranging from U-1 -- the most restrictive -- to U-6 -- the most expansive. In between is U-3, the official unemployment rate. That’s the one you see reported in the news most often. The U-3 official unemployment rate in Wisconsin was 4.6 percent in 2015. That rate is updated monthly. The most recent rate, for February 2016, was also 4.6 percent. The U-6 rate, meanwhile, is sometimes referred to unofficially as the "real" unemployment rate. U-6 includes people who are unemployed, plus "marginally attached workers," meaning those who are not in the labor force but want to work and are available for work. It also includes people who want to work full time but, because of economic conditions in their area, are able to work only part time. The U-6 rate is calculated only annually. Wisconsin’s U-6 rate for 2015 was 8.3 percent -- again, far below Trump’s 20 percent. Trump made a similar claim in June 2015 in announcing his run for president. He said the "real" unemployment rate for the United States at the time was "anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it." (At the time, the official unemployment rate nationally was 5.5 percent.) PolitiFact National rated that statement False, citing U-6 figures as we've cited. Trump’s campaign staff didn’t respond for that fact check and, as of press time on this fact-check, had not responded to our requests for information. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin’s "effective" unemployment rate is 20 percent.

pomt-10479	"Again today (Ahmadinejad) made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/hillary-clinton/a-911-denier-yup/	Discussing global threats and whether it's wise to directly engage Iran in talks on matters such as its nuclear program, Sen. Hillary Clinton during the April 16 Democratic debate ruled out meeting with Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As she criticized the Bush administration for failing to deter Iran from pursuing its nuclear program, Clinton said Ahmadinejad's most recent inflammatory remarks would make it impossible for her to speak with him directly. "I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad because even again today he made light of 9/11, and said that he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died," Clinton said. Ahmadinejad, who has a history of provocative statements on such things, including saying the Holocaust was a fake, did indeed, question the U.S. version of the events of 9/11 on three occasions in just over a week. He said U.S. claims about being attacked were a pretext for military action against Iraq and Afghanistan. "Four or five years ago a suspect event took place in New York," Ahmadinejad said in an April 16 speech in the holy city of Qom that was broadcast live on state television, according to Agence France Presse. "A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed, whose names were never published. Under this pretext they (the United States) attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed." Ahmadinejad first expressed his doubts about the attacks on April 8 at a ceremony in the holy city of Qom celebrating Iran's nuclear program, which U.S. officials worry could be used to make weapons. He questioned how aircraft could have evaded radar and intelligence and crashed into the twin towers undetected. Ahmadinejad repeated his doubts the next day at a speech at a Shiite holy shrine in the city of Mashhad, according to press accounts. Iran condemned the attacks soon after they occurred. The government at the time was headed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami. Ahmadeinejad has been given to bellicose pronouncement in the past and provoked a global outcry when he described the Holocaust as a myth. During his controversial visit to the United States in September 2007, Ahmadinejad, when asked about the death penalty Iran imposed on homosexuals, denied there were homosexuals in Iran. He has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction. On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intention to change the international order, Agence France Presse reported. "We have two missions," Ahmadinejad proclaimed. "To construct Iran and change the global situation. It is impossible to reach the summits of progress without changing the corrupt and unjust order of the world." Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and intended to expand energy supplies for a growing population. The statement may be startling, but it's true. Clinton accurately summarized Ahmadeinejad's recent comments about 9/11. We judge her statement to be True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-16T00:00:00	2008-04-16	['Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad']
pomt-10673	"I'm prolife. I'm not going to apologize for becoming prolife. Ronald Reagan followed that same course, as did Henry Hyde and George Herbert Walker Bush. And I'm proud to be prolife."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/mitt-romney/their-shifts-were-less-stark/	Under attack from Alan Keyes during a GOP debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Mitt Romney said he's not the only politician to have changed his position on abortion. He cites three prominent Republican figures to make his case, but their shifts are far less stark than his. Let's take them one at a time. We examined Romney's abortion record here. After supporting abortion rights early in his political career, he changed his mind after meeting a stem-cell researcher in 2004. As governor of California in 1967, Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill legalizing "therapeutic" abortions, defined as those approved by medical staff where there is substantial risk to the physical and mental health of the woman, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. Biographer Lou Cannon, in his 2001 book Ronald Reagan: The Presidential Portfolio, writes that it was a difficult decision. "Reagan did not know what to do," Cannon writes. "His staff was divided (also largely on religious lines), and he was lobbied heavily from both sides. … After several days of indecision, Reagan reluctantly signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act. After he recognized its consequences, he became an opponent of abortions, except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest." Thirteen years later, Reagan ran for president under a platform that included strong opposition to abortion. Now, the case of Henry Hyde: In the early 1970s, in the Illinois legislature, he initially was receptive to a colleague's request that he co-sponsor a bill relaxing the state's ban on abortion. But after he read up on the issue, he declined. "I had never really thought about abortion, so I read the bill and read a book: The Vanishing Right to Live , by Charlie Rice. I became convinced that abortion was an evil," Hyde says in a 2006 National Review article, "Hyde in Winter," by John J. Miller. Hyde did not support the bill, rather he helped defeat it. As he went on to Congress, he became a strong abortion opponent, winning passage in 1976 of what became known as the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal funds for abortion. George H.W. Bush's position on abortion was an issue as Reagan considered him as a running mate in 1980. "While he personally opposes abortion, he is against passing a constitutional amendment to make it illegal," a Newsweek article said of Bush that year. Reagan, running on a strict antiabortion platform, needed a vice presidential candidate who was right there with him. Richard Allen, Reagan's foreign policy adviser at the time and later national security adviser, writes about the angst in the Reagan camp in an article for the New York Times . " 'There's Bush,' I suggested, half expecting him to close off the discussion. Instead he paused and then said, 'I can't take him; that "voodoo economic policy" charge and his stand on abortion are wrong.' " Allen goes on to say that Bush was approached by Reagan himself about whether he could pledge to support the platform. That was the beginning of Bush's unwavering antiabortion support. Planned Parenthood says Bush "turned his back on reproductive health care to be Reagan's running mate," while the National Right-to-Life Committee endorsed him for president in 1988. So, where does that leave us? Reagan had an abortion-rights moment early in his career. Hyde briefly considered backing the abortion-rights bill of a colleague. Bush at one time opposed outlawing abortion. Still, it's difficult to compare records on this issue because of the way the political landscape and dialogue has changed over the years. None of the three politicians Romney cites made so clear a change as he did, but he's not entirely wrong either. We rule Romney's statement Half True.

pomt-07382	Says the Internal Revenue Service estimated it must hire "16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer" to enforce the federal health care overhaul.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/may/04/saxby-chambliss/us-sen-chambliss-says-16500-irs-agents-needed-heal/	More than a year after Congress approved a health care overhaul, the debate is far from over. Legal challenges are working their way through the courts. States are preparing for major changes. Opponents continue to rail against "Obamacare." Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are working to understand what it all means to them. When a constituent wrote a letter to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, his office replied with a three-page defense of his opposition to the law that the recipient shared with us. One argument concerned new tax credits, taxes and a host of other rule changes for businesses and individuals that will require new technology, administrators and paperwork to implement. This boosts the Internal Revenue Service’s workload. "In order to fully enforce the provisions of this bill, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that it will be required to hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer," the Chambliss reply said. An additional 16,500 agents? That’s nearly the population of Decatur. Is this correct? PolitiFact Georgia’s parent publication, PolitiFact National, checked related claims twice before. So has FactCheck.org, a nonprofit team that performs similar work to PolitiFact. We found that Chambliss’ claim has led a long existence with several incarnations, all of which are misleading. The Truth-O-Meter first ruled on a similar statement by U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican and one of at least a dozen lawmakers who made this point during last year’s fight over the legislation. He said that "according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates" of the health care bill. Kirk’s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled. The 16,500 actually came from an estimate from Republicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. House Republicans voted against the final health care bill. This is what actually happened: The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years, but it suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact ruled. Republicans picked numbers at the high end of the CBO estimate that favor their case, the ruling concluded. Another problem is that even the Republicans on Ways and Means acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if they factored in overhead such as desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. The jobs figure is based on an estimate for the costs of benefits and payroll for a single worker. PolitiFact ruled Kirk’s claim Barely True because it’s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees. The assertion continues to resurface. FactCheck.org noted that Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take "16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work." It called the comment a "wildly inaccurate claim." FactCheck.org also pointed out other problems. For instance, it misrepresented the Ways and Means estimates, which were for the number of potential employees. Actual IRS agents only make up a small percentage of the IRS workforce. The rest are clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and others who are not involved with enforcement. And only a small segment of agents -- law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases -- are armed. U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar claim in January but earned a better PolitiFact rating than Kirk did. She noted the health care bill "may" put those agents in charge of policing the bill, not that they would. This more careful language earned her a Half True. After Bachmann made her statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012. It includes estimates for workers it needs to begin implementation of the health care act. We read the 159-page document and counted requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes at a cost of $473.4 million. They were typically for support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Most were not agents. And so we turn to Chambliss’ claim. The attribution is incorrect. The 16,500 figure did not come from the IRS, but from Republican members of Congress who opposed the law. That estimate was for employees, not "agents." And it didn’t account for overhead costs, which even the claim’s supporters acknowledged would likely lower the jobs number. For 2012, the IRS estimate is 1,269, mostly in non-enforcement roles. Chambliss’ statement that the IRS estimated it must "hire an additional 16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer" to implement health care reforms not only repeated an oft-criticized, misleading claim. It got the claim wrong. We therefore rule Chambliss’ statement False.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2011-05-04T06:00:00	2011-03-28	['None']
pomt-09354	"The number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is about the same as it was when the mandates were passed in 2006."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/apr/05/rick-perry/perry-says-uninsured-number-bay-state-about-same-h/	Criticizing the new federal health care law's requirement that most Americans have insurance starting in 2014, Texas Gov. Rick Perry argues in an April 2 column in the Austin American-Statesman that such broad mandates are "ineffective." The column also was published by the San Angelo Standard-Times. As evidence, Perry turns the spotlight onto Massachusetts, which has required that adults have health coverage since July 2007. "The number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is about the same as it was when the mandates were passed in 2006," Perry wrote. In a state held up as a shining example by health care reform advocates, that's quite an indictment. Is it true? While waiting last week for Perry's office to elaborate, we looked into how many people are insured in the Bay State. In April 2006, Mitt Romney, then-governor of Massachusetts, signed into law a health care plan with the aim of helping that state reach nearly universal insurance coverage. The plan — similar in some respects to the new federal law — included an expansion of the state's Medicaid program, subsidized coverage for eligible residents and the creation of exchanges where individuals and small businesses could buy coverage. The Massachusetts individual mandate applies to residents who are 18 or older and has penalties for not complying, although people whose incomes are at or below the federal poverty level are exempt. Dick Powers, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Health Connector, an agency that administers parts of the state's health care system, said children were not included in the mandate because virtually all of them already had insurance in 2006. Now for the numbers: According to Powers, about 600,000 Massachusetts residents did not have insurance when the state's health care legislation was signed. Since then, he said, 408,000 people have obtained coverage. The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy estimates that in 2009, the share of people without insurance was down to 2.7 percent, the lowest uninsured rate in the nation. The division says that translates roughly into 171,000 people — a far cry from the 2006 "before" number of 600,000. It's also a far cry from Perry's claim that the number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is relatively unchanged, a statement that Powers called "outrageous" and wrong. “Someone saying that probably doesn’t believe Nolan Ryan ever pitched a no-hitter either,” Powers said. For another source, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, whose most recent data on the subject are from 2008. According to estimates based on the bureau's Current Population Survey, a sampling of about 100,000 households that has been done for more than 50 years, Massachusetts had about 657,000 uninsured residents in 2006. That roughly matches up with the state's estimate of 600,000. By 2008, the number of uninsured in Massachusetts had dropped to about 350,000, according to the Census Bureau's CPS data. Another Census Bureau measure puts that estimate even lower. Based on the American Community Survey, a more reliable source of state data than the CPS because the surveys are sent to more households, about 263,000 people in Massachusetts lacked health insurance in 2008. (That was the first year the ACS included a question about health insurance coverage.) However you do the the Massachusetts math, the number of people without health insurance has dropped by at least 300,000 since 2006 — not the "about the same" that Perry airs in his column. So where does this leave Perry's statement? After we'd visited with officials elsewhere, a Perry aide told us by e-mail Monday that the governor's statement was "an error." Perry's office also sent us a new version of his Friday column that removes the Massachusetts claim while adding one that references Hawaii, which we're not reviewing in this article. But Perry's original column has already been widely circulated on the Internet, making a correction problematic. Perry's retraction does not change the ridiculous nature of his Massachusetts claim. We rate Perry's unamended statement — the one published in the Austin American-Statesman — as Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-04-05T18:05:43	2010-04-02	['Massachusetts']
pomt-03175	"The House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-bill-clinton-continued-kosovo-/	Congress is about to debate whether the U.S. should act militarily in Syria in the wake of suspected usage of chemical weapons by the regime of Bashar Assad. After initially sending signals that the military might strike before waiting for approval by Congress, the Obama administration ultimately decided to ask for congressional approval. This set up the possibility that President Barack Obama might feel pressed to pursue military action even in the face of a congressional rejection. And because the NATO air campaign in Kosovo in the late 1990s proceeded along similar lines, the Kosovo experience quickly became a part of the discussion of Syria. On the Aug. 1, 2013, edition of Fox News Sunday, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said, "The House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass. But he had bombing missions being carried in Kosovo after the House of Representatives voted against him taking action." King is a senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. Is King right that there is precedent for a president carrying out military action even after the House specifically voted against authorizing such action? First, some background. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia -- Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups have long disputed the territory known as Kosovo, and after greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Seeking to prevent casualties like those that had proliferated in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995, NATO -- the military alliance of the United States and western Europe -- edged in 1998 and 1999 toward action against the Serbs, who it viewed as the aggressors. NATO initiated airstrikes on March 24, 1999, a campaign that would continue for the better part of three months, until agreements were reached for Serb forces to withdraw, for the Kosovo Liberation Army to disarm and for refugees to return home. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence; 100 countries have recognized it, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, despite ongoing negotiations by the United Nations and other international officials, its final status remains unresolved. Did the House reject Clinton over Kosovo? During his second term as president, Clinton pressed Congress to authorize NATO military action in Kosovo. On March 23, 1999, the Senate, by a 58-41 vote, passed a non-binding authorization of force. The Senate resolution backed "military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)." That’s short of a declaration of war -- the method outlined in the Constitution -- but it is similar to what other presidents have sought, and usually received, from Congress in recent decades when they wish to pursue military efforts abroad. (In this article, we take a closer look at the differences between post-World War II declarations of war and authorizations for the use of military force.) The day after the Senate passed this resolution, NATO bombing commenced. But the House of Representatives did not vote on the Senate-passed resolution until more than a month later. On April 28, 1999, the House took up several pieces of legislation on Kosovo. By a 249-180 vote, the House prevented any Defense Department funds from being used on a ground campaign. Meanwhile, by a 139-290 vote, the House defeated an effort to remove U.S. armed forces from the Kosovo conflict. A more traditional declaration of war failed by an even larger margin -- 2 votes for, 427 against. But the most important legislation -- and the one directly relevant to judging King’s claim -- was the Senate resolution that authorized air and missile strikes against the Serbs. It failed the House in a rare tie vote, 213-213. The vote was a stinging rebuke to Clinton, and an embarrassment to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who backed a president from the opposite party. The defections were mixed -- 31 Republicans supported Clinton’s request while 26 Democrats voted against it. The New York Times, which called the debate "heated and sometimes anguished," reported that White House spokesman Jake Siewert brushed off the House vote. "The House today voted no on going forward, no on going back and they tied on standing still," Siewert said. "We will continue to prosecute the air campaign and to stop the violence being perpetrated by (Serb leader Slobodan) Milosevic." Indeed, NATO continued airstrikes the following day and for about two months after the failed House vote. Did the House eventually reverse course and authorize the campaign? By saying that "ultimately, a vote did pass," King suggested that the House did ultimately authorize force in Kosovo. But whether that’s true is not as settled as the first part of his claim. On May 20, 1999, the House passed an emergency appropriations bill that funded the Kosovo campaign. By funding military activities that were already under way, the spending bill can be seen as a way for Congress to tacitly back the Kosovo campaign, even though the bill did not explicitly use language that authorized the war. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress watcher, said King phrased his statement broadly enough to be accurate. In addition, Ornstein said, it was a narrowly targeted emergency spending bill, rather than an "omnibus" bill funding potentially hundreds of programs. That suggested to him that it’s "a direct vote on continuing to bomb," he said. Other experts say "not so fast." The War Powers Resolution, passed in the wake of the Vietnam War, was intended to stop presidents from fighting wars without input from Congress. Under the War Powers Resolution, a president can initiate military action but must receive approval from Congress to continue the operation within 60 days. Presidents from both parties have regularly ignored the law, and Congress has often been reluctant to assert itself. But it remains on the books. As it happens, section 8(a)(1) of the resolution addresses the question of whether a spending bill constitutes authorization. It says, "Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall not be inferred … from any provision of law … including any provision contained in any appropriation Act, unless such provision specifically authorizes the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities … and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this joint resolution." That would suggest that approving spending does not equal authorization. But to make things even more complicated, there is some case law (particularly the 1973 case Mitchell v. Laird) suggesting that appropriations measures might be sufficient as to infer authorization, said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. Our ruling King said that "the House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass." King is right that the House failed to pass an authorization for military action in Kosovo, and that Clinton continued to pursue the air campaign despite the legislative setback. However, it’s not a slam dunk that "ultimately, a vote did pass." The House did pass a spending bill covering the costs of the Kosovo campaign, but not an authorization along the lines of what is required by the War Powers Resolution. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Peter King	None	None	None	2013-09-04T13:58:32	2013-09-01	['Bill_Clinton', 'Kosovo']
pomt-03164	"We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-majority-businesses-are-exempt-bus/	Florida’s CEO-turned-governor has a big crush on businesses. Republican Gov. Rick Scott loves them so much that the majority don’t have to bother paying business taxes, he told a conservative crowd at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation conference in Orlando. Scott told the crowd that during his tenure the state has cut taxes five times (we noticed he pared down his claim quite a bit from earlier this summer when he said he cut taxes 24 times.) "We cut property taxes for homeowners and businesses. We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax. And we got rid of a sales tax on machinery and equipment so we will have more manufacturing jobs." Do nearly three-quarters of Florida businesses not pay a business tax? Corporate income tax exemptions grew under Scott PolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott’s promise to eliminate the corporate income tax rate over seven years. The tax is paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Scott initially wanted the Legislature to reduce the corporate tax rate, but that didn’t work out. So he took a different route: relieving businesses of paying the tax by upping the amount of income exempt from the tax. In his first year, Scott lobbied to exempt the first $25,000 worth of taxable income, up from $5,000. In 2012, he got the Legislature to raise the exemption to $50,000. Scott wanted to then raise the exemption to $75,000 but the Legislature didn’t go along with it in 2013. We turned to Florida Department of Revenue data to show what percentage of businesses don’t pay corporate income taxes. There were 49,562 corporations in total and 38,060 would have been exempt from the tax -- or about 76.8 percent in 2011. The tax exemption for those businesses adds up to $12.6 million. That left 11,502 businesses that paid about $166 billion in corporate taxes. These numbers represent the 2011 tax year, filed in 2012. The exemption has increased since then, so the number of exempt corporations may be slightly different. We should note that many of these small businesses didn’t have to pay the corporate income tax before Scott’s tenure, too. Department of Revenue data shows of the 38,060 exempt businesses, about half earned less than $5,000 and therefore were exempt before Scott took office. We interviewed two experts about Scott’s claim: Kurt Wenner of Florida TaxWatch and Sam Staley, managing director of Florida State University’s DeVoe L. Moore Center, which aims to increase public understanding about the role of government in a market economy. Both Wenner and Staley pointed out that large businesses have always paid the lion’s share of the corporate taxes -- and continue to do so after Scott’s exemptions. (The large businesses get that exemption, too, but for them it means they don’t pay the tax on a small slice of their income.) "Small businesses don’t contribute that much to overall revenue," Staley said. Therefore, the state is "not losing that much by exempting them." However, even small businesses could be paying several other taxes or fees, such as property or sales taxes or in some cases, licensing fees. To assess a state’s business climate, "you have to look at an entire portfolio of taxes and regulations," Staley said. "Even if they don’t have to pay state corporate income tax, it might not be enough to compensate added costs of permitting at the local and county level," Staley said. Wenner said that anytime the state can reduce taxes it will increase Florida’s attractiveness for businesses. However, "Florida’s corporate income taxes have never really been that high." Our ruling Scott said "70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax." His general point was that during his tenure, he’s been cutting all sorts of taxes. State data for 2011 taxes shows that 76.8 percent of businesses don’t pay the corporate income tax due to the exemption. Scott is including some very small businesses here in his calculation and omitting that many of them were exempt from paying this tax before he took office. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06616	Says he did not support the October 2008 legislation to rescue Wall Street firms.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-never-was-2008-wall-street-resc/	Stumping for president in Newton, Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry denied that he ever supported the 2008 legislation approved by Congress to rescue Wall Street. A recording of Perry’s Sept. 16, 2011, comments was placed online by Steve Deace, a radio host, who says on the recording that "our very own" Rebekah Maxwell asked Perry about his "past endorsement" of the "controversial (Troubled Asset Relief Program) bailout ... which a lot of people believe launched the Tea Party movement in America." Our transcript of the Maxwell-Perry exchange: Maxell: "One thing that I was wondering about was your earlier support for TARP and how that ... makes a difference?" Perry: "You got wrong information." Maxwell: "You never supported TARP?" Perry: "No, ma’am." Maxwell: "No. I thought I saw a letter where you had actually written encouraging the support of TARP legislation." Perry: "No, ma’am, you saw wrong." Did Perry never support the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which established TARP and allowed the bail out of Wall Street? Fortuitously, this covers turf we plowed in January 2010 in rating Half True a claim by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison that Perry was for the Wall Street bailout before he was against it. Hutchison said in a Texas gubernatorial debate that Perry signed a letter sent to members of Congress on the day the Senate was scheduled to vote on the bailout bill, urging lawmakers to "pass an economic recovery package." "You wrote a letter to Congress saying pass this bill, we need to shore up the financial markets," Hutchison said. "…Governor, you asked for it too. You were for it before you were against it." In the debate, Perry conceded that he co-wrote a letter with West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. But, he said, he and Manchin "thought you were smart enough to understand what we were talking about--stop the spending and cut the taxes." "Governor," Hutchison replied, "that’s not what the letter said." "I wish we’d made it a little clearer for you," Perry said. Perry probably could have made it clearer for everybody. This much is certain: On the morning of Oct. 1, 2008, the Republican Governors Association and Democratic Governors Association publicized a three-paragraph letter signed by their respective chairmen, Perry and Manchin, stating: "We strongly urge Congress to leave partisanship at the door and pass an economic recovery package ... If Congress does not act soon, the situation will grow appreciably worse." The letter doesn’t explicitly endorse the plan then before the Senate. But no other plan was in play that day amid national fears of an economic collapse. And The Associated Press cast the governors' letter as part of a frantic national push for the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street sought by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and President George W. Bush. Later the same day, Perry issued a contradictory-sounding second statement, partly headlined: "On Protecting Taxpayers." "In a free market economy," Perry said, "government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to bail out corporate America." Asked to clarify at the time what Perry wanted the Senate to do, his spokeswoman, Allison Castle, demurred. "The senators have to make their own decisions," Castle said. Asked in 2009 about Perry's dual messages, Perry spokesman Mark Miner saw nothing confusing. Miner said Perry simply favored tax and spending cuts over bailouts. "You call on Congress to take action, nine times out of 10, the action they take is wrong," Miner said. After the Republican gubernatorial debate, we sought out Manchin for his take on the letter. In a comment delivered by a spokesman, Manchin said: "You had to look at the situation our country was facing then. What we were urging was for Congress to work together in a bipartisan effort, and to follow the lead of the governors ... to move the states ahead. That effort continues today." At the time of the Senate action in 2008, Manchin said he supported his state's two Democratic senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, who voted for the Wall Street package. But he too sounded a contradictory note: "I do not support a bailout. Nobody supports bailing somebody out on the backs of working people … for someone to profit on Wall Street." All in all, it's easy to see the rationale for charging Perry with being for the legislation. The Manchin-Perry letter urged action on the very day the Senate was poised to take up the bailout package. Still, Perry is correct that the joint letter didn’t explicitly advocate the Senate plan. Also, his second Oct. 1, 2008, statement could be taken as a timely signal he didn’t want Congress to rescue Wall Street the way it did. We rate Perry’s claim Half True.

pomt-07558	Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/01/david-prosser/wisconsin-supreme-court-justice-david-prosser-says/	The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job. Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker. The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice. That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School. Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg "is incredibly envious" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime. "I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder," Prosser said. He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: "She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years." That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience. More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work. It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg. We asked for backup. Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which "were for the DNR." "Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers," he said. Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse. Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: "If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate." Sykes added: "If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy." But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest? The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included. The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23, two days after the debate at Marquette. In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased. She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers. Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River. Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws. When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court. "I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases," Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were "a little rhetorical flourish." Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin. "Those are the two I was most familiar with," Prosser said. He added this about his dock comment: "I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases." But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate. Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: "I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list." Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record "while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’" Let’s bring this ship to shore. Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the "breadth" of those cases. What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a "rhetorical flourish" and an attempt at "levity." That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign. At PolitiFact, a statement is False if it is not accurate. It’s not accurate to say that Kloppenburg’s has only handled dock cases. That’s a ridiculous claim -- from a justice who has heard her argue a variety of cases before him on the state’s high court. False plus ridiculous equals Pants on Fire.

pomt-04268	Says Jeb Bush "extended early voting" after seeing "long lines."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/08/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-jeb-bush-extended-early-voting/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist emerged as a prominent critic of Gov. Rick Scott’s decision not to extend early voting before the presidential election. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent who campaigned on behalf of President Barack Obama, joined Florida Democrats in asking Scott to give voters more time to cast early votes, citing long lines in Orlando and South Florida on Nov. 4, 2012, the last day of early voting. Scott declined to extend early voting to Sunday, a move Crist denounced as "unconscionable" given the hours-long wait times. In an interview with Miami-based CBS 4, Crist pointed to his decision as a Republican governor in 2008 to extend early voting, a move that irritated Republicans who thought (correctly) it would help Obama voters. "Got a lot of grief from Republicans, but you know, when you’re governor, you don’t just work for one party or the other, you work for the people of the state,’’ Crist said on Nov. 4, 2012. "I saw the long lines. I saw that it was still hot in South Florida, a lot of senior citizens were waiting in those lines. And I realized it was an emergency situation where people needed to have the opportunity to vote. "The same thing, or a similar thing, happened under Gov. Jeb Bush, and he extended early voting as well as governor," Crist said. We wondered if Bush really extended early voting during an emergency-like situation. Early voting Bush actually signed into law the statewide maximum of 14 days for early voting in 2004. Election supervisors said it was highly popular and asked the Legislature to expand early voting hours and add more locations. But Bush and the GOP-led Legislature went the other way the next year, passing a law that capped the number of hours for early voting and confined it to election offices, city halls and libraries. Early voting remained popular -- especially with Democrats. In 2011, the Legislature and Scott enacted a new law that reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Democrats in the Legislature said the law was designed to depress voter turnout among people in their party. The 2002 primary Things were going haywire in South Florida during the primary election on Sept. 10, 2002, the first statewide election since the infamous 2000 presidential recount. It was the election that determined Bill McBride, and not Janet Reno, would be the Democratic gubernatorial challenger for Bush. Some precincts in Broward and Miami-Dade counties opened hours after their scheduled 7 a.m. start. New, untested touch-screen voting machines malfunctioned. Some people walked away without casting a vote. Bush issued an executive order that called for polls to stay open two additional hours statewide. That meant the polls stayed open until 9 p.m. for most of the state and 10 p.m. for the Panhandle, which is in the Central Time Zone. Neither Bush nor his top elections official, Secretary of State Jim Smith, were pleased with having to make the call. "I frankly wonder what in the hell have they been doing for two years," Smith was quoted as saying about the South Florida elections officials in an Associated Press report. "I am hopeful that by November, at least they will be able to open the polls on a timely basis and the equipment will work." Bush ordered the extension "out of fairness," according to the Associated Press. "It's shameful. It's the responsibility of the supervisors of election to be prepared," Bush said. "The state put up money - significant sums of money - for training, for machines. ... There's no excuse for not having precinct workers in a precinct for voting, no excuse for not turning on the machines." In a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida, Crist said the point he was trying to make about Bush was that "the guy had a heart" amid chaos at the polls. "In a voting situation in Florida, when help was needed, he answered the call," Crist said. Charley and 2004 Flash-forward to 2004, when Floridians faced an onslaught of hurricanes. Hurricane Charley walloped Southwest and Central Florida on Aug. 13, just days before the start of early voting for the Aug. 31 primary election. Bush declared an elections emergency for 10 counties struck by Charley on Aug. 19, as the storm had ruined some voting equipment and made it difficult to locate and train poll workers. In a letter, Bush authorized the state’s top elections official to waive election law to delay the start of early voting and help counties hurt by the storm with logistics, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. Early voting had begun in all but three counties affected by Charley. "The letter gives counties that were affected by the hurricane and the secretary of state the flexibility they need to meet the needs of residents," Bush spokesman Jacob DiPietre told the Sentinel. "That could be combining precincts if a building was destroyed. It gives them the ability to move polling places and to waive certain deadlines and fees." To be clear, this does not count as an example of Bush extending early voting. He was allowing for greater flexibility in counties affected by Hurricane Charley. Our ruling In his attempt to portray Scott as more concerned about politics than voters, Crist argued that even Bush, a popular Republican, extended early voting as governor. Well, not exactly. In 2002, Bush extended regular voting by two hours because of malfunctioning voting machines -- not early voting. And in 2004, he gave supervisors a handful of counties more flexibility in starting early voting days after a devastating hurricane. It’s important to note that both events were primary elections. Crist made it sound like Bush issued early voting extensions during a presidential election, as Crist did, to accommodate large turn-out. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15145	Says Scott Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/01/gwen-moore/scott-walker-didnt-fund-law-requiring-independent-/	In April 2014, Gov. Scott Walker signed a groundbreaking law, a decade in the making, that provides for this: Any time there is a death in Wisconsin and a police officer is involved, an outside agency -- not the officer's own department -- must conduct an investigation. News coverage suggested Walker was enthusiastically behind the bill. And since then, Walker on occasion, including at least once on the presidential campaign trail in New Hampshire, has made a point to say that the law he signed was the first of its kind in the nation. U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, offers a different view on the GOP governor and the law. While speaking to reporters in Milwaukee on Aug. 26, 2015, Moore was asked about a comment she made about Walker’s campaign for the White House. Two days earlier, in a teleconference with reporters, she had said Walker's policies are "tightening the noose, literally, around African-Americans." Moore told the Milwaukee reporters she might have chosen her words differently. But she defended her criticism of Walker’s policies, such as drug testing food stamps recipients, which she said hurt African-Americans. And regarding the law on officer-involved deaths, Moore said of Walker: "He brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." The implication is that Walker signed the law, but hamstrung it by not allocating money to enforce it. As we’ll see, Walker initially did not provide extra funding for a state agency that does the bulk of reviews, but ultimately signed a state budget that provided the funding. Officer-involved deaths around U.S. Officer-involved deaths around the country, particularly since the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., have spurred a number of claims that have been checked by PolitiFact National. Among them: National Urban League CEO Marc Morial said "the number of killings of citizens by police" in the United States "is at a two-decade high." Our colleagues rated the statement Half True. There were many unknowns in the available data. Wisconsin’s investigation law was prompted in part by the 2004 fatal shooting 21-year-old Michael Bell by police in the Wisconsin-Illinois border city of Kenosha. Wisconsin’s law The law, which had Democratic and Republican co-sponsors, applies to deaths that result "directly from an action or an omission of a law enforcement officer while the law enforcement officer is on duty, or while the law enforcement officer is off duty but performing activities that are consistent with his or her law enforcement duties," according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council. It says all police agencies must have a written policy regarding the investigation of officer-involved deaths, and that the policy must require a team of at least two investigators to conduct the review. The law does not specify that any particular state or local agency run the investigation. Once the investigation is complete, a report must be submitted to the district attorney in the county where the death occurred, for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the investigation agency must release its report to the public. The funding Republican J.B. Van Hollen, who was the state attorney general when Walker signed the law, asked Walker to include money in the 2015-’17 state budget in order to implement the law. The request, for the Department of Justice, was for $738,600 for five positions -- three special agents and two analysts. Walker, however, did not include the any funding for the law as part of the budget he submitted to the Legislature in February 2015. The next month, as the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee reworked Walker’s budget, newly elected Attorney General Brad Schimel, also a Republican, renewed the funding request. "As a result of the new legislation, the DOJ has become the go-to investigative resource when there is an officer-involved critical incident in Wisconsin," Schimel told the committee. "Officer-involved death cases are very time-consuming. It is critical to public confidence in law enforcement that the investigations be conducted expeditiously and capably. In addition to the intensive work involved in conducting the investigations following an officer-involved death, the DOJ typically receives public records requests from parties. These requests require the careful review of reports, photographs, crime scene diagrams, audio and visual recordings and other multi-media prior to release." Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick responded at the time by saying that when the bill was adopted, the Department of Justice did not anticipate a fiscal impact, and the governor's office believed no additional resources would be needed. She cited a memo that had been issued by Walker's budget office a few months before the bill became law. "If DOJ feels as though additional funding is necessary to address these cases, we are willing to work with them and the state Legislature to ensure adequate funding," Patrick told the Capital Times. Two months later, in May 2015 -- with a state report showing DOJ had investigated 12 deaths in the less than a year since the law took effect, up from seven in 2013 -- the committee agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested. So, although the law didn’t specify that the state Department of Justice investigate officer-involved deaths, as a practical matter it has become the agency doing them. The $635,000 allocation made by the Joint Finance Committee, for three agents and one analyst, ultimately became part of the two-year budget that Walker signed into law in July 2015. Our rating Moore said Walker "brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didn’t fund it." Walker has cited the fact that a law he signed was the first in the country to require independent investigations of deaths that involve police officers. And he did not include in his 2015-’17 budget proposal funds requested by the state Department of Justice for five positions to implement the law. However, three months later in the budget process, Walker signed a final budget that included money for four positions, which had been added to the spending plan by state lawmakers. So, ultimately, Walker did include some funding, although only after the Legislature included it in its version of the budget. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Moore a Mostly False.

pomt-14132	Says Donald Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, build a wall, ban Muslims, and more.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/05/hillary-clinton/clinton-video-lists-8-promises-trump-presidency/	Even before Donald Trump’s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, "Everything I say I’m going to do folks, I do." It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We’ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren’t actually promises. We did not hear back. ‘Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day’ At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. "I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases," Trump said. "My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones." The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, "I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools." Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. ‘Defund Planned Parenthood’ Trump’s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, "Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood," and then continued "but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood." Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. ‘Repeal Obamacare’ There doesn’t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says "On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare." ‘Build a great great wall’ Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn’t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish ‘a deportation force’ There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said "You’re going to have a deportation force. And you’re going to do it humanely." We couldn’t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn’t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, "Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States." Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, "We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out." Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn’t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. ‘Ban Muslims from entering the country’ Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign issued a statement saying, "Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on." Within a few days, Trump said certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the New York Times, within his first 100 days "the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place." That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. ‘Kill the spouses and children of our enemies’ Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. "The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families," Trump said. In an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O’Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said "I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer." Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, "We have to be much tougher." Trump finished his answer with, "I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives." While this could be a death threat, it isn’t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn’t say how much. Restore waterboarding and ‘go further’ In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, "I would bring back waterboarding and I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer he would "go further." Trump has also said that "torture works." The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials’ advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn’t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate. We rate the collective package Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a27d6e08-b5ec-40bb-aeb2-e15557be8d62	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-05T18:10:25	2016-05-03	['None']
pomt-05623	Says a study shows that children who live with a biological parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend "have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/25/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-state-senator-says-study-shows-kids-/	The tasks of Wisconsin’s Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board include raising public awareness about the mistreatment of children. Under a bill introduced in February 2012 by state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, the board would be required to "emphasize non-marital parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect." That’s a reference to homes where a child lives with a biological parent and the parent’s boyfriend or girlfriend. The "non-marital parenthood" focus of the bill attracted national news coverage from CNN and the Huffington Post. It also drew criticism from advocates of single parents such as liberal talk show host Alan Colmes. During his national Fox News radio program on March 2, 2012, Colmes asked Grothman to explain the bill. "We do have a child abuse and neglect board and their goal is to educate people on how to reduce abuse," Grothman replied. "Now the studies show that, if you are living with your two biological parents compared to with a biological parent and a boyfriend or girlfriend -- if you were with that boyfriend or girlfriend, you have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused." Grothman went on to say that "people certainly know there are single moms who are good parents and there are single moms who aren’t. But when the statistics show you’re 20 times greater -- in one type of family structure than another -- to cause a child to be a victim of sexual abuse, it’s something that ought to be out there." We decided to take a look at Grothman’s numbers. Grothman’s evidence Although he said "studies," Grothman made it clear to Colmes that the statistic he cited is from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study on child abuse and neglect published in January 2010. Mandated by Congress, the study "serves as the nation’s needs assessment on child abuse and neglect" and is the fourth in a series that dates back to the 1970s. The newest study surveyed child protective service agencies in a representative sample of 122 counties about abuse and neglect cases they investigated during a one-year period -- the second half of 2005 and the first half of 2006. The study also obtained information about children who were identified by professionals as having been abused or neglected but whose cases were not officially investigated. A major difference was found among perpetrators of different types of abuse. More than 70 percent of children who were physically or emotionally abused were abused by a biological parent, but only 36 percent of children who were sexually abused were sexually abused by a biological parent. As for Grothman’s claim, Grothman aide Lance Burri cited a chart in the study on the rate of sexual abuse in different types of households. The chart shows that children living with two married biological parents were sexually abused at a rate of 0.5 per 1,000 children, while the rate for children living with a single parent with a partner in the home was 9.9 per 1,000 children. That means the sexual abuse rate for children living with a single parent who has a partner in the home was 19.8 times higher than the rate for children living with biological parents who are married. So, by saying the rate is 20 times higher, Grothman is correct, a point we confirmed with the study's lead author, Andrea Sedlak. She noted that the study did not determine who the perpetrator was in the cases where children who were sexually abused were living with a parent and the parent's partner. We would also note that the sexual abuse rate wasn’t higher in all types of single-parent homes. The same chart Grothman cited shows the rate among children living with a single parent who had no cohabiting partner (2.4 per 1,000 children) was lower than that of children living with other married parents, such as a biological parent and a stepparent (4.3 per 1,000 children). Other viewpoints We asked Ken Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, about Grothman’s claim. His group is one of three that lobbied against Grothman’s bill. Taylor said that while Grothman accurately quotes the study, a child living with a single parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend is only one of many risk factors associated with abuse and neglect generally. Others include poverty, an adult’s substance abuse or mental illness, and whether the adult was abused as a child, he said. The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which also opposed Grothman’s bill, testified at a hearing on the bill that promoting marriage over single parenthood could put children at greater risk if there is domestic violence in a home with married parents. Conversely, promoting the reduction of substance abuse among adults, for example, would have only a positive impact on child abuse and neglect, the coalition said. The Legislature didn’t act on Grothman’s bill before adjourning its session in March 2012. That means the bill would have to be re-introduced to be considered and Grothman hasn’t made a decision about doing that, his aide said. But the bill’s statement -- that "non-marital parenthood" is a "contributing factor to child abuse and neglect" -- is supported by the study. The overall rate of abuse and neglect was lowest in homes with married biological parents -- 6.8 per 1,000 children. It was highest for children living with one parent who had an unmarried partner in the household -- 57.2 per 1,000 children. That’s more than eight times higher than the rate in households with married biological parents. Our rating Grothman said a federal study shows that children who live with a biological parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend "have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused." Grothman accurately quotes the study, which found that the rate of sexual abuse among children who live with a biological parent and the parent's partner is 20 times higher than the rate for children who live with their married biological parents. We rate his statement True.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2012-03-25T09:00:00	2012-03-02	['None']
pomt-04516	Romney "would turn Medicare into a voucher program."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/	President Barack Obama wasted little time deriding Mitt Romney’s Medicare plan as a "voucher program" while talking entitlements in the first presidential debate. "First of all, I think it's important for Gov. Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future," Obama said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. "And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program." In the past, PolitiFact has found Obama’s "voucher" characterization reasonable, though as Obama noted, Republicans prefer "premium support." Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as "a written affidavit or authorization … a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school." The plan pushed by Romney’s running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, isn’t exactly a coupon, but it’s not so far off. Democrats have attacked Ryan’s Medicare reform ideas since he presented his first version in early 2011. Ryan has since tweaked his ideas, and Romney indicated in a summer interview that he agrees with Ryan’s most recent plan, which Ryan presented as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Under the current system, the federal government pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services. That would end under the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. Instead, beneficiaries would have the choice of receiving a fixed subsidy from the federal government that could go toward a private insurance plan or a plan similar to traditional Medicare. We should note the plan would only apply to people who are under 55 today, not current seniors. The private plans would comply with standards set by the federal government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the health insurance exchange. We don’t know with certainty whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details. Some experts in health policy say there are marked differences between the terms "voucher" and "premium support." While there are technical differences that may matter to health-policy professionals, these are not the type of differences that most beneficiaries would see as significant. In recent years, the definitions of "premium support" and "vouchers" have become almost indistinguishable. Generally, we think "voucher program" is a fair way of describing to voters the vision for Medicare under a Romney-Ryan administration. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14683	Among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, "there look like very few women. Very few children."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-refugees-migrants-are-mo/	Donald Trump repeated a false notion Thursday at the South Carolina Republican debate that the flight of Syrian refugees and other migrants is largely men. Trump was asked by Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto about his proposal to ban Syrian refugees and others from entering the United States. Trump rattled off incidents around the world, including in Indonesia and France, and said that migration could be a "great Trojan Horse." "When I looked at the migration, when I looked at the line … where are the women?" Trump said. "There look like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men. Young. And people are looking at that and saying, ‘What’s going on?’ " Trump made a similar claim in October. It was False then, and it’s False now. We asked Trump’s campaign for more information about his claim but did not hear back. However, there are two databases that track the movements of migrants in Europe and Syrian refugees. Neither supports his statement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers as of Dec. 31, 2015, the total comes to more than 4.6 million. Of those 4.6 million, 50.7 percent are female and 51.8 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. So the majority of refugees are: 1. Women; 2. 17 or younger. In all, only 22.7 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18. Looking at the migrant crisis more broadly only slightly helps Trump’s case. The U.N. also tracks so-called "sea arrivals," refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The counts a little more than 1 million people who have crossed into Europe since the start of 2015, with almost 3,800 dying during the journey. The U.N. breaks those migrants into three categories: Adult men, 49 percent; Adult women, 19 percent; and children, 31 percent. Our ruling Trump said that among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, "there look like very few women. Very few children." The data in no way supports that claim. The majority of more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees entering Europe are women and children 17 and younger. Of migrants arriving by sea -- about 1 million people -- 31 percent are children and 19 percent are women. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10999	"If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/12/paul-soglin/gubernatorial-candidate-paul-soglins-claim-about-g/	The most recent mass shooting, which killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in Annapolis, Md., reignited the gun control debate. The tragedy brought to mind a claim made earlier this year by Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin. During a March 23, 2018, news conference, Soglin claimed: "The latest statistics demonstrated that if there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder." In light of recent events, we decided to examine Soglin’s claim. Guns and the risk of suicide, assault When asked to backup the claim, Soglin pointed to a January 2016 article in The Trace, a nonprofit news organization focused on gun issues, titled "A gun as a defense against terrorists? The stats say it’s more likely to harm your family." The article cites a statistic we came across frequently during our research -- household gun ownership triples the risk of suicide and doubles the risk of homicide. In addition, the article highlighted a study that found access to firearms increases the likelihood of assaults against family members and others to whom people are close, such as girlfriends or boyfriends, escalating to homicide. That 1992 study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found death was 12 times more likely if such assaults involved a firearm than if the assault did not involve a firearm. However, neither the study nor the article states that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than they are for self defense. So, where did the number come from? Well, if Soglin added all of the numbers — three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide — he would have gotten 17. But the numbers cannot be added together -- family and intimate assaults that escalate to homicide are already accounted for under homicides as whole. In addition, none of these numbers compare the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide, which was the focus of Soglin’s claim. The studies compare the risk of gun ownership to non ownership. Are there other studies that are on point? According to a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Medicine that examined 16 published studies, people in the United States with access to a firearm are three times more likely to die by suicide than those who do not have access, and are two times more likely to die by homicide. This study made no mention of family or intimate assaults, and did not make comparisons with self defense. We could not find any recent studies comparing how often guns are used for suicide and assault vs. how often they are used for self defense, but there is a 20-year-old study that comes close to corroborating Soglin’s claim. That 1998 study by A.L. Kellermann with the Emory University Center for Injury Control said for every time a gun is used in the home for self-defense or legally justifiable shootings, it is used four times in an unintentional shooting, seven times in a criminal assault or homicide and 11 times in an attempted or completed suicide. The study found a gun is 18 times more likely to be used in an attempted or completed suicide, homicide or assault than it is for self-defense. But some of these homicides may involve strangers and, therefore, it would not be entirely accurate to say this study supports Soglin’s claim about the danger to known victims. What’s more, gun laws, ownership and crime rates have changed since this study was completed, so its findings may be out of date. Finally, Soglin’s larger point about guns being used infrequently for self defense is generally accurate. A study done using federal crime and victimization statistics by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to stopping gun deaths and injuries, found that between 2007 and 2011, there were 29.6 million victims of an attempted or completed violent crime. Of those victims, 235,700 used a firearm as a form of self defense. That means about 0.8 percent of attempted or completed violent crimes involved a victim using a firearm as a form of self-defense. Our rating Soglin claimed "If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder." Soglin is on point in stating a gun is much more likely to be used for a suicide, assault or homicide than used in self-defense, but is on less solid ground when it comes to stating exactly how many times more likely. That depends on the study, many of which do not differentiate between known and unknown victims. What’s more, recent research is limited. Overall, we rate Soglin’s claim Half True.

pomt-06615	"Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/21/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-400-richest-taxpayers-saw-incom/	During a Sept. 20, 2011, interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., sought to highlight how America’s richest taxpayers have benefited economically in recent years. "The top 400 earners in this country are worth more … than half of the American people," Boxer said. "And since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent and their tax rates go down 40 percent." We checked the first part -- that the top 400 tax payers saw their incomes grow by 400 percent -- in March 2010, giving it a rating of True. But the second half of her statement was new to us, so we decided to look into it. When Boxer made her comments, the question of how much the wealthy should pay in taxes was at the top of the national agenda. In remarks on Sept. 19, 2011 about his plan for reducing the federal debt, President Barack Obama said that "middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires. That’s pretty straightforward. It’s hard to argue against that. Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett." (Buffett is the legendary investor who for years has placed high on the list of richest Americans.) As we explored elsewhere, Obama is correct that it’s possible for a secretary to pay a higher tax rate than a very wealthy person, but it’s also not typical. In general, wealthier taxpayers do in fact pay a higher percentage in taxes than less-affluent people. The main exceptions are people in Buffett’s category -- the richest of the rich, whose income comes mainly from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at 15 percent rather than the maximum of 35 percent for wages and salaries, and hedge fund managers, who benefit from a tax code provision that also taxes their earnings at 15 percent. In her comment, Boxer explicitly focused on Buffett’s peers. Her data comes from a periodic Internal Revenue Service report that looks at the income and tax data from the 400 tax returns with the highest adjusted gross income. (In case you’re wondering, these 400 titans aren’t named, and their data is aggregated.) Technically, these aren’t "families" necessarily, but for a comment made during a television interview, we think it’s close enough. We’ll take Boxer’s two claims in order. The data we’re using, which goes back to 1992, is adjusted for inflation. "Since 1995, the top 400 wealthiest families have seen their incomes go up 400 percent." In 1995, the aggregate adjusted gross income for all 400 tax returns worked out to $17.4 billion, or an average of $43.6 million per return. By 2008 -- the most recent year available -- the aggregate income for the top 400 soared to nearly $66 billion, or more than $164 million in adjusted gross income per return. That amounts to a 276 percent increase. If Boxer had been using data one year older, she would have been correct: Using 2007 data, the rise was almost exactly 400 percent. This illustrates how sensitive this measurement is to economic conditions. "Since 1995 the top 400 wealthiest families have seen … their tax rates go down 40 percent." From the same IRS document, we can see that the average tax rate for the top 400 returns was 29.93 percent in 1995 and 18.11 percent in 2008. That’s a decline of 39 percent -- for our purposes, close enough to Boxer’s claim to be accurate. Our ruling On the data, Boxer is right for one claim and wrong for the other, though on the one for which she’s incorrect, she would have been right using data from one year earlier. More broadly, even the smaller, 276 percent increase supports her underlying point -- that for the richest of the rich, incomes have grown by leaps and bounds while average tax rates have declined for the same group by 40 percent. As we’ve noted, extrapolating tax-burden patterns from the super-rich (like these 400 tax-paying units) to the merely very rich, the rich or the plain old affluent should be done with care. As the Congressional Budget Office has determined, the tax system is generally progressive, despite the lower tax rates for Buffett and his peers. The poorest one-fifth has an effective tax rate of 4.3 percent, the next fifth has a rate of 10.2 percent, the middle fifth has a rate of 14.2 percent, the second-highest has a rate of 17.6 percent, and the top fifth has a rate of 25.8 percent. And the rates keep going up the higher you climb. The top 10 percent of earners had an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent, the top 5 percent had a rate of 29 percent, and the top 1 percent had a rate of 31.2 percent. In other words, the top 400 have a distinctly different tax pattern than even the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers, a much larger group that includes about 1.1 million households with an average pre-tax income of $1.7 million. Still, Boxer chose her words carefully. She referred to the top 400 taxpayers, and by that standard, her numbers, while imperfect, largely stand up. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-02464	"Chained CPI would save $1 trillion in the second decade off the federal budget debt," a report shows.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/23/david-brooks/chained-cpi-and-what-it-means-federal-budget/	President Barack Obama has yet to formally roll out his 2014-15 budget, but it is already notable for one idea that won’t be in it. Something called chained CPI, or consumer price index, has become a flashpoint in the debate over the deficit and spending on entitlement programs. It is a technical shift that would affect everything from how much the government bumps up government payments to how it calculates the taxes we owe. Put simply, using chained CPI would save the government money (and cost you some money). The president included a version of chained CPI in last year’s budget. Excluding it this year avoids a fight within Democratic ranks over preserving the value of Social Security. The move caught the attention of the Sunday talk shows. David Gregory, host of NBC’s Meet the Press prodded his panel of analysts, saying both parties were in campaign mode. "Yes. And it's all bad for the country," said David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times. "Chained CPI would save a trillion dollars in the second decade off the federal budget debt." We decided to take a closer look at Brooks’ figure. But first, a little bit about this thing called chained CPI. Seeking an accurate way to track inflation Chained CPI matters because so many bits and pieces of the government’s business are indexed to inflation. The list includes tax brackets, pension benefits, the cut-off point for tax credits, who’s eligible for food stamps, and most prominent of all, Social Security benefits. The aim of all this indexing is to keep everything in line with the actual cost of living. If a retiree has $100 to spend on groceries today, 15 years from now he or she should be able to buy the same amount of food even if prices went up. The problem is, economists generally agree that the way the government measures inflation today exaggerates inflation by a tiny bit. The technical problem is that as prices of some goods and services rise, people will change what they buy. Chained CPI adjusts for that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analysts for Congress, calculated that chained CPI is about one-fourth of 1 percent less than the measure in place today. It hardly sounds like much but over time, the impact builds. Depending on how much you earned, when you retire and how long you live, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a group focused on preserving government programs for less affluent Americans, estimated it would reduce benefits by 1 to 2 percent over the course of the average retirement. Defenders of Social Security don’t like chained CPI because it reduces the amount of those monthly checks. Anti-tax groups don’t like it because shifting tax brackets would, bit by bit, increase people’s income tax bills. But from a deficit reduction perspective, chained CPI has plenty of fans. They often point to the CBO estimate that over 10 years, the change would reduce the accumulated deficit by $340 billion -- $216 billion in lower spending plus $124 billion in higher tax revenues. About half of that lower spending would come from Social Security. The source of the $1 trillion We tried to reach David Brooks to determine the source of his claim and we didn’t hear back. He did not get it from the CBO because that group has provided no estimate beyond 2023. (Brooks clearly spoke about savings taking place in the "second decade.") We found the $1 trillion figure in publications from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for aggressive steps to cut deficits. In a fact sheet, the group wrote, "The chained CPI would reduce the deficit by over $1 trillion in the second decade." "I will caution that the estimate is not an official CBO cost estimate," Jason Peuquet, a research fellow at the committee, told us. Peuquet said the number was derived from several government sources including the CBO and the Social Security Administration. "So it is grounded in the best projections available." he said. But projecting so far out is perilous. CBO sometimes goes beyond a typical 10-year window, but it offers many caveats when it does. In a long-term projection for Social Security, for instance, CBO ran 500 different scenarios. It stood by the general direction of its conclusions but not the specific numbers. That said, the figure Brooks used might be close. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, compared the $1 trillion to the CBO’s estimate for using the chained CPI across all government activities. "Under such a proposal, an estimate of $1 trillion for the second 10 years is probably in the ballpark," van de Water said. However, Van de Water underscored that there is a substantial difference between the across-the-board policy the CBO evaluated and what Obama had in his budget last year and is dropping this year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Van de Water said the total 10-year savings would have been about $100 billion less. When Brooks talked about the impact of the president’s new budget, he was not comparing it to the last one from the White House. "Brooks is roughly accurate about the theoretical savings but has somewhat overstated the savings from the proposal that the Administration actually put on the table," Van de Water said. Peuquet also offered one reminder. He said that Brooks would have done better to have spoken of reducing deficits -- the government’s yearly gap between what it spends and what it takes in -- rather than the nation’s debt, which is the accumulated money it owes to lenders. Our ruling Brooks said that using the chained CPI would reduce U.S. debt by $1 trillion in the period of 11 to 20 years from now. That number did not come from the Congressional Budget Office, the one government body that members of both parties count on for impartial long-term projections. Also, the chained CPI estimate Brooks cited goes beyond what Obama proposed last year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Those caveats would bring down the savings, no matter what the real number is. We rate Brooks’ statement Half True.	None	David Brooks	None	None	None	2014-02-23T18:22:53	2014-02-23	['None']
pomt-02014	"Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/08/katrina-vanden-heuvel/vanden-heuvel-1-out-10-minimum-wage-workers-today-/	The city of Seattle refreshed the national debate on the minimum wage recently by approving a plan that will gradually hike its hourly minimum wage to $15. The move positions Seattle with the highest minimum wage in the country, almost $5 more than than the $10.10 level sought by President Barack Obama. ABC’s This Week spotlighted the decision in a June 8, 2014, segment pitting Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot against The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel. Gigot argued the proposal may have detrimental effects by pushing young earners with toes in the workforce out of low-wage jobs. Vanden Heuvel countered with a point that inverted popular understanding of who is affected by minimum wage policies. "Listen, this is smart economics, it’s good politics, and it’s morally right," she said. "First of all, only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person." PunditFact wanted to fact-check her talking point. What the numbers say We have unpacked similar claims over recent months. The notion that most minimum wage earners are young workers starting out their professional careers or teenagers working over the summer or to pay for college is not always cut and dried. A February Congressional Budget Office report says that "of the 5.5 million workers who earned within 25 cents of the minimum wage in 2013, three-quarters were at least 20 years old and two-fifths worked full time." But are just 10 percent of minimum wage earners young adults or teenagers? The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a reliable federal trove of employment data, is the most detailed source of information on federal minimum wage workers. But even its data isn’t complete because it focuses only on workers who earn the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That does not account for workers in the 21 states and District of Columbia with higher minimum wage levels, from $7.50 in Missouri to $9.32 in Washington. Half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour, according to the Congressional Budget Office report, which makes for a significant caveat. Still, according to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. (Someone can earn less than the minimum wage thanks to exceptions in the law for vocational students, for example.) That’s a far cry from what vanden Heuvel said. A different study Vanden Heuvel told us she was trying to describe who would benefit from raising the minimum wage, and that the majority of those people would be older workers. That’s not what she said, but we’ve seen others make the same mistake -- including Obama. Vanden Heuvel appears to rely on data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. The institute looked at workers who would benefit from increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, which would include everyone who makes less than that amount, not just those workers earning $7.25. The institute also factored in workers making up to $11.10 an hour currently, assuming that if workers below them would get a raise, they would as well, EPI report author David Cooper said in April. So what did EPI find? Among the people who EPI believes would get a raise, only 12.5 percent are less than 20 years old. Here’s a breakdown by age bracket: Age EPI (workers earning up to $11.10) 19 and under 12.5% 20-29 36.5% 30-39 16.6% 40-54 20.8% 55 and over 13.7% So that’s closer to one in 10, though it doesn’t factor in young adults in their 20s and it’s measuring workers who might benefit from raising the minimum wage -- not who is making the minimum wage today. "The number she is using is much more along the lines of who would get a raise, not who is today a minimum wage worker," said Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The Congressional Budget Office report also looks at workers who would be affected by a hike in the minimum wage, using the same logic as EPI that some employees would indirectly see a pay increase to retain their spot in a company pecking order. CBO projected 12 percent of workers who would be paid $11.50 an hour or less by 2016 are teenagers (Table 2). CBO did not break down its data by more narrow age groups. Our ruling During a faceoff with a Wall Street Journal editor on ABC This Week, vanden Heuvel listed several reasons in favor of raising the minimum wage. "Only one out of 10 minimum wage workers today are teen age or a young person," she said. Her words described the current demographics of minimum wage workers, but that is not what’s reflected by the research we found. According to the BLS, workers who are 16 to 24 years old comprise 50 percent of workers who earn at or below the federal minimum wage. Vanden Heuvel was wrongly describing a study of who would get a raise from increasing the minimum wage. According to the liberal Economic Policy Institute, teens would make up 12.5 percent of people who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10. We rate her claim False.

A Dec. 21, 2016, headline on the website USA Snich read, "Pope Francis To Followers: ‘Koran And Holy Bible Are The Same’," claiming the pontiff said as much in an hourlong visit with Vatican visitors. The story said Francis told the guests that the religious teachings were equally valid, and that the time is ripe for "merging our faiths." Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts with PolitiFact and other fact-checking websites to debunk potentially fake news. To be clear, we can find no evidence Francis ever said such a thing, although the story persists on Facebook with links tracking back to a variety of websites. The post refers to the Monday prior to its publication, which would have been Dec. 19. Francis did speak to a group that day, telling Italian children to spend time with their grandparents. USA Snich is another website that appears to mix fake news and real events, sometimes posting stories that are entirely fabricated like this one.

pomt-02587	There is "more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-buy/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama noted the country’s progress toward energy independence. There is "more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly 20 years," he said. Later in the speech, he added, "The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades." Earlier in January, we fact-checked Obama’s same claim about domestic oil production after he spoke at North Carolina State University. We rated it True after PolitiFact dug into the U.S. oil numbers. Here’s what we had found: A White House spokesman offered up this White House blog post that explained Obama’s point in more detail. According to the White House, Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. "Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,"Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil at home than its buying from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-01-28T22:58:49	2014-01-28	['None']
pomt-06042	Mitt Romney is "tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/winning-our-future/video-says-mitt-romney-planning-quadruple-size-his/	The 28-minute video "When Mitt Romney Came to Town" -- an attack on the Republican presidential candidate’s experiences with the private-equity firm Bain Capital -- claims that Romney is "tearing down his 3,000-square-foot house to build an 11,000-square-foot house." When the news came out last summer, it became something of a media sensation. Vanity Fair published a list of things that "could fit inside Mitt Romney’s new house," including a Memphis-area Enterprise-Rent-A-Car facility, Jennifer Aniston’s old house and "the world’s largest whale." But is the tale accurate? There’s a bit of disagreement over two issues -- the square footage involved, and whether the project is actually going forward. We’ll tackle those two issues individually. The dimensions of the "tear-down" project The home in question is located in La Jolla, Calif., an affluent oceanfront neighborhood adjoining San Diego, Calif. A recent article by the San Diego Union-Tribune makes the Romneys’ immediate neighborhood sound positively dreamy. "The area’s winding lanes are lined with Tudor-style mansions, shingled California bungalows and cottages that could have been airlifted from the Cotswolds," the article said. (The Union-Tribune noted that Romney trails both President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee in donations from the 92037 ZIP code.) Mitt Romney and his wife Ann bought their property, located on what is described as a quiet cul-de-sac, in 2008 for $12 million; two years later, it was assessed at $8.7 million. The Union-Tribune reported that it was built in 1936 and has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths. It has a lawn that slopes down to a white sand beach. Columbia Journalism Review’s "The Audit" blog noted that the vast majority of the property’s value stems from its location, rather than its structure: "The county assessed the value of Romney’s house at $8.7 million last year," The Audit reported. "Eight million bucks of that value was in the land and just $750,000 was in the 3,000 square-foot house and other improvements." Will Carless, a staff writer with the Voice of San Diego who lives nearby and often surfs in the vicinity, said the expanse of the Romneys’ parcel is notable, with structures placed far enough back not to get hit by even the biggest swells. "Half his yard is ice plant," he said, referring to a non-native species of flora. "I’ve often looked up and thought it was such big waste of space." Apparently the Romneys did, too. The size of their family was also a factor. A campaign spokesman told the Chicago Tribune that the reason for nearly quadrupling the size was to make room for visits by the couple's five married sons and 16 grandchildren. When the Union-Tribune initially reported the proposed renovation on Aug. 21, 2011, it cited a permit application Romney had filed with the City of San Diego to bulldoze the existing, 3,009-square-foot, single-story home and replace it with a new, two-story, 11,062-square-foot structure. That’s the source of the information used in the Winning Our Future video. But that description has been contested by Romney himself, in an interview with New Hampshire Union Leader publisher Joseph W. McQuaid on Aug. 29, 2011. McQuaid wrote: "It's not accurate, Romney said, simply. The application he made, two years ago, was to double the living space by turning one story into two. The 'quadrupling'' was a measurement of added nonliving space, including a basement and garage." Granted, even doubling a home’s size is no trivial undertaking. Still, it’s not quadrupling. We wondered if Romney had a point that the description was overblown. So we asked the National Association of Realtors for what the standard practice would be for making such comparisons. "There's no national standard for measuring or reporting square footage," said Stephanie Singer, a spokeswoman for the real estate trade group. "Those rules are usually dictated by local zoning ordinances and/or state laws. So determining square footage can vary widely across the country. Some jurisdictions may include rooms like unfinished basements, for example, while others do not." She added that the association’s code of ethics does not directly address the question of disclosures about a home’s square footage. "The code does stipulate that Realtors shall be honest and truthful in their real estate communications," she said. "In the case of determining square footage, however, Realtors often rely on disclosures and information made by the sellers." Without solid guidance, we think it’s reasonable for the filmmakers to have used the numbers that Romney stipulated on the application itself. That makes this part of the film’s portrayal accurate. Is the tear-down going forward? The video’s phrasing suggests that the project is proceeding. But that’s not necessarily accurate. Dave Schwab, a reporter with the La Jolla Light newspaper, told PolitiFact that he bumped into a T-shirt-and-jean-clad Romney outside his house as Schwab was initially reporting the story of the tear-down last August. Romney was in a rush to leave town, but he told Schwab he would put him in touch with his staff for further information. Schwab recalled the staffer telling him in so many words that Romney is "running for president, and as soon as that ends, he will revisit the project." Interviews with Schwab and others confirmed that the project has not yet begun. In fact, we have not seen any reports that the project has even received official government approval yet. In a Jan. 2, 2012, article, the Union-Tribune reported that city officials described the plans as being "on hold." Other reports suggest that some of the neighbors aren’t wild about a large-scale expansion, though it’s unclear what role, if any, that could play in the approval process. One key step in the process involves an environmental review -- and a real estate agent who is representing nearby homes said that’s no piece of cake. "That’s nowhere near a rubber stamp of approval," said Craig Lotzof of the Lotzof Group. "Any time you build along the coast -- it doesn’t matter who you are -- you have lots of hoops to go through." So while there’s no sign that the Romneys have backed off their tear-down plan, it also isn’t imminent, and it still faces practical hurdles. So the video’s suggestion that a tear-down is under way or about to start is incorrect. Our ruling The video used a reasonable figure for dimensions of the "teardown" project -- even though the Romney campaign calls it a doubling of living space, the official application uses numbers that would amount to a quadrupling. But the video implied that the project is under way when in fact it’s not imminent. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-14128	Says Donald Trump "brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/may/06/ted-cruz/donald-trump-attacked-bringing-hundreds-foreign-wo/	Donald Trump has promised to be the "greatest jobs president that God ever created." But he’s also been attacked for his record of hiring foreign workers. A Ted Cruz ad that aired in Indiana attacked Trump’s use of temporary foreign visas known as the H-2B program: "Trump still brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans," stated the narrator. Cruz dropped out of the presidential race May 3 after losing Indiana, but we suspect Democrats will be happy to launch this same attack line at Trump in the months to come. So we decided to look into it. The bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it’s unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren’t necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn’t do or didn’t want. Mar-A-Lago foreign workers Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach County is an oceanfront eating club designed for the 1 percenters. The club’s website describes itself as offering "an incomparable, royal lifestyle" in a historic 126-room mansion. It offers a beach and pool, a spa and fine dining for those who can afford the $100,000 initiation fee. The club’s director of human resources referred us to the campaign for this fact-check, and a campaign spokeswoman did not respond. The charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don’t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can’t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don’t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn’t fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn’t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren’t hired because they didn’t meet requirements. Some applicants didn’t want to work split shifts, or didn’t have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn’t respond when the resort contacted them. One applicant said they only were applying as a prerequisite to continue getting unemployment. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. News reports suggested Mar-A-Lago did the bare minimum to meet legal requirements to try to recruit U.S. workers. For example, CNN wrote that job openings were placed in a local newspaper with small circulation for just two days rather than a larger newspaper. Nationally, while employers claim there are labor shortages in lower- and semi-skilled occupations, "there is no credible evidence that such labor shortages exist," wrote Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, in a paper in January. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. "The only reason they wouldn’t get a callback is that they weren’t qualified, for some reason," Trump replied. "There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area." But some experts question Trump’s assessment that it’s hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn’t show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trump’s foreign hiring practice.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. "We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them," Veenstra said. "There has been nothing else since then." There are plenty of local applicants, said Greg Schell, an attorney in Palm Beach County who represents foreign workers. "The local job fairs for hotels and other hospitality jobs are overwhelmed with applicants," he said. Our ruling A Cruz ad says that Donald Trump "brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans." Federal labor records show Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Cruz makes it sound like foreign workers took jobs from Americans already in positions, but that’s not the case. It’s an ongoing debate whether there were qualified Americans who would have been willing to work the seasonal, part-time service jobs for which the club was hiring. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3005282b-5e81-43c3-8528-a8e96171c7a7	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-05-06T15:00:00	2016-05-02	['United_States']
pomt-01574	Says cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/how-much-have-medicare-beneficiaries-paid-system/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee recently aired an ad in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. It features a woman named Darlene Blake of Des Moines, Iowa, talking about the importance of Medicare. "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare," Blake says. "That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us." In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that Braley "voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." Here, we’ll look at the claim that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it." The ad has a point that Americans 65 and over have "paid in" to Medicare through the payroll taxes they’ve paid throughout their working lives. Currently, workers pay a 1.45 percent payroll tax for Medicare, while employers kick in an additional 1.45 percent. Self-employed people pay both parts of the tax. Meanwhile, starting in 2013, households earning $125,000 (or $200,000 or $250,000, depending on the number of people in the household and their tax-filing status) pay an additional 0.9 percent Medicare tax. However, it’s not as if those payroll taxes are placed in an account for that beneficiary’s future use alone. Instead, the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by workers of all ages (combined with the proceeds of current beneficiaries’ Medicare premiums) foot the bill for the Medicare costs of today’s beneficiaries. And the way the math has worked out over the years, today’s beneficiaries have gotten far more back in Medicare spending than they put into the system through their tax payments. We discussed this topic in 2013, using statistics from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research institute in Washington. We’ll recap their findings here, updated with the most recent data. Institute researchers figured out what people turning 65 in various years have already "paid in" to the system and what they can expect to "take out" after they reach age 65. Because marital status and family income can significantly affect both the amount paid in and the amount paid out, the institute offers calculations for various types of family units. To make the final amounts comparable to what might have been done with the tax money had it been invested privately, the institute adjusted all dollar figures at 2 percentage points above the rate of inflation. (The authors note that different assumptions for long-term returns on investment would change the results.) We looked at the statistics for three "cohorts" of seniors -- those who turned 65 in 2000, 2005 and 2010. That means they’re 79, 74 and 69 years old today. We found that, for Medicare recipients, the "worst" deal for any of these demographic groups is still quite generous. A two-earner couple, with one high earner and one average earner, who both turned 65 in 2010 would have paid $158,000 in Medicare taxes over their lifetimes, but can be expected to be the recipient of $385,000 in Medicare spending. That’s a ratio of $2.40 in benefits for every dollar paid in taxes -- and that’s the least generous ratio we found. The highest such ratio we found was for one-earner couples in which the earner turned 65 in 2000 and was paid the average wage. Such a couple would have paid $39,000 in Medicare taxes but can expect to benefit from $306,000 -- a ratio of $7.80 in Medicare spending for every dollar the couple paid in taxes. So the ad’s claim -- that cutting Medicare is "just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it" -- is greatly exaggerated. For today’s typical Medicare beneficiary, what they paid into the system represents just 13 percent to 41 percent of what they can expect to get out of it. The rest is funded by younger Americans’ payroll taxes. The fact that taxes paid by active workers are supporting today’s generation of retirees is a big reason why some policymakers are concerned about the program’s long-term solvency. In 1950, the average American lived for 68 years and retirees were supported by 16 active workers. Now, the average life expectancy is 78 and just three workers support every retiree. By the time today’s middle-aged workers reach retirement age, only two workers will be around to support their benefits. Promised benefits will exceed revenues by about 30 percent, and there will be no money in the trust fund to rely on. "The problem with the quote from the ad is that it is numberless," said C. Eugene Steuerle, who helped assemble the Urban Institute’s calculations. " ‘We paid for it’ doesn’t say what we ‘paid’ nor what ‘it’ is, since the program expands constantly over time." Steuerle added, "We paid for our parents’ Medicare. There’s very little money sitting in the trust funds. The issue is what we think we should expect from our children, which requires consideration of the cost and the benefits." Our ruling The ad says that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already "paid in. We paid for it." While Americans have indeed "paid in" to Medicare, the amount that today’s beneficiaries have paid in only covers a fraction of their expected costs. The taxes paid by today’s typical beneficiaries will cover just 13 percent to 41 percent of what those beneficiaries can expect to get from Medicare during their lifetime. The rest of what has been "paid in" for their care has come from younger Americans. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11591	"Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/joe-kennedy/do-ceos-make-300-times-average-worker-joe-kennedy-/	During the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III bemoaned the seismic income gap between top executives and the average employee, even as he celebrated the current bullish economy. Emphasizing the need for greater economic fairness, Kennedy said workers should take home a larger share of corporate profits, relative to that of their bosses. "We choose an economy strong enough to boast record stock prices," he said, "and brave enough to admit that top CEOs making 300 times the average worker is not right." We wondered if the pay gap between top executives and the average employee was as wide as Kennedy claimed. What the numbers show As we’ve noted previously, the gap between CEOs and workers is vast, but there’s no standard formula for computing the figure, which means there’s room to quibble over the numbers. Results vary based on which corporations — and how many of them — are used in a study, and researchers use different definitions to define workers and stock options, and to compute salaries. At the high end is the AFL-CIO. The labor union’s analysis compared the 2016 compensation of CEOs of S&P 500 Index to those of production and nonsupervisory workers. It found top executives, on average, received $13.1 million in total compensation, while the average employee earned $37,632. That’s a ratio of 347 to 1. An analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also produced a large disparity in pay, though relatively smaller than that of the AFL-CIO. The institute’s study of 2016 compensation used two different measurements, which varied in their treatment of executives’ stock options. The first measure assumed stock options were cashed in, and therefore were added to CEOs salary, bonuses and other payouts. Under that measure, CEO compensation was found to 271 times the average worker’s pay. Under the second measure, in which stock options were granted but not cashed in, the ratio was 224-to-1. Bloomberg analyzed 2017 income data and found CEOs made 265 times more than the income paid to average workers. Kennedy’s office did not reply to our request for comment. Our ruling Kennedy said, "Top CEOs (are) making 300 times the average worker." His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. The AFL-CIO put the ratio at 347-to-1. The liberal Economic Policy Institute said CEOs make either 271 or 224 times that of average employees, depending on how you measure stock options. Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 265-to-1. We rate his claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joe Kennedy	None	None	None	2018-01-31T00:56:50	2018-01-30	['None']
pomt-09184	After the oil spill, Congressman Adam Putnam "doubled down saying all energy sources, including oil drilling in the Gulf, should be considered just days after the oil spill started."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/02/scott-maddox/maddox-says-putnam-double-downed-oil/	Scott Maddox, Democratic candidate for Florida commissioner of agriculture, is trying to portray his Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, as supporting oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico -- despite the recent oil spill. In an e-mail to his supporters, Maddox said: "While the oil slick has not yet made it to Florida’s shores, it gets closer and closer with every day that goes by. It’s nothing short of a ticking time bomb for our incredible beaches and tourism economy. "The Florida legislative leaders who pushed for oil drilling in state waters – as close as three miles from our beaches – have even backed off. But not Putnam. He doubled down saying all energy sources, including oil drilling in the Gulf, should be considered just days after the oil spill started." Maddox's campaign said the email was dated May 25, 2010, but the copy we received was May 27, 2010. Maddox, a former Tallahassee mayor, has been using the oil spill -- and his challenge to Putnam to permanently rule out increased drilling -- to draw attention to the race. Maddox's Tallahassee law firm is suing BP and Transocean, which managed the rig, on behalf of fisherman and seafood restaurants. Maddox spokesman Steve Vancore pointed to Putnam's efforts to broker a deal on oil drilling in 2006 as evidence that he's been supportive in the past. At that time, he proposed allowing drilling "as close as 50 miles from shore" and got 13 other Florida Republicans to sign along, leading to passage in the House, the St. Petersburg Times reported April 2, 2010. Putnam's campaign manager Trey McCarley didn't dispute that position but noted that the bill gave important power to the states. They could petition the federal government to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles from the shore. But if not, a 125-mile ban would be in effect. To back up the new claim from Maddox, Vancore pointed us to an article in the Panama City News-Herald posted on April 24, 2010 -- four days after the rig collapsed -- to show Putnam's support for oil drilling. The article, about Putnam's visit to a paper mill and talk at a GOP dinner, said: "Putnam said he disagreed with Maddox’s anti-drilling mantra of 'No, baby, no' and that he thought all energy sources should be considered. 'The government should avoid picking winners and losers in exploring new energy,' he said. 'I have been generally supportive of opening up those areas, and specifically supportive of opening up those areas that are well off shore.'" Vancore told us in an email that's a "double down" because "Putnam not only restates his support of drilling but ups the ante by specifically restating his support of drilling in areas that are 'well off shore'. ... He matched his bet when he said he is generally supportive" of near shore drilling and doubled-down when he said 'specifically supportive' of all others. But in exploring Maddox's claim about Putnam, we find some sleight-of-hand in his timing. There is no dispute that Putnam had supported increased oil drilling in the past and continued to support it a few days days after the initial explosion. But the quotation that Maddox cites that shows Putnam's comment came four days after the accident, before the magnitude of the oil spill was truly known. A look back at the news coverage of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and an AP timeline shows that it took nearly a week after the April 20 rig collapse for it to be clear that a major spill had occurred. On April 23, one of the dominant stories was that the search had ended for the 11 missing workers. At that point, an oil sheen had been reported but no leak detected. In fact, the headline from one AP story on that day was: "Coast Guard: No oil leak from sunken rig off Louisiana." But officials feared "as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below." On April 24 -- the day that Putnam made his statement -- oil was found leaking from the well for the first time but the amount was unknown. Then, in an April 25 AP article, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said "This is a very serious spill, absolutely." By April 28, Coast Guard increased the estimates of the leak from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels of oil a day. By May 2, the large magnitude of the spill was clear. A Miami Herald article May 2 stated that Florida emergency managers "acknowledged Saturday that the state can't protect every stretch of coastline threatened by an uncontrolled undersea gusher spewing a massive oil slick that has spread across the Gulf of Mexico faster than expected." Gov. Charlie Crist warned that Florida could face a catasprophe. On May 3, Maddox held a press conference to attempt to "shame" Putnam into preventing expansion of drilling, according to a May 3, 2010 blurb in The Buzz, a blog of the St. Petersburg Times. "I think it's astounding that four days after the explosion Adam Putnam was reaffirming his position in favor of off-shore and near-shore oil drilling," Maddox said. "The most important thing is that we don't face this type of risk very close to our shores." Putnam's campaign replied the same day, according to the May 3 blog: "I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil spill is causing. Everyone from the president on down has correctly said we should have a thorough investigation of its causes and the lack of preparedness of the industry to respond to a disaster before proceeding with any new exploration." By then, Florida politicians were making an about-face on oil drilling -- including Putnam. In a May 3, 2010, statement on his web site he said: "I am deeply concerned about the economic and ecological damage the oil leak is causing. This is a national disaster. It is clear to every elected official, from the President on down that consideration of any new exploration closer to shore needs to be taken off the table and we need to have a thorough investigation into what happened and the inability of the industry to effectively respond." To recap: It's clear that Putnam had long supported an expansion of oil drilling before the spill. And he held the same position on April 24 when he was quoted by the Panama City newspaper. But the magnitude of the spill wasn't clear until a day or two later. Maddox is right about Putnam's comments, but he's playing fast and loose with the timing and his statement is misleading.

pomt-02157	Says Attorney General Eric Holder recently revealed "this idea to have government have gun owners wear special bracelets that would identify you as a gun owner."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/01/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-eric-holder-wants-gun-owners-wear-id-b/	"Waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists" was not the only questionable thing Sarah Palin said during her recent speech to National Rifle Association enthusiasts. In stirring up concerns about gun rights, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee turned conservative rabble-rouser misrepresented comments from Attorney General Eric Holder about investments in smart-gun technology. "Every day we are seeing more and more efforts to strip away our Second Amendment rights," Palin told the crowd. "They are trying," she said, before leading into her claim about Holder. "Recently, he reveals this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner," Palin said. "Well, hey, Holder, you don't want to go there, buddy." There is more to the story than Holder wanting gun owners to wear identifying bracelets. Holder’s comments on gun bracelets Holder uttered the words "guns" and "bracelet" before a House appropriations subcommittee on April 4, 2014, as he testified about his agency’s 2015 budget request. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to "encourage development of innovative gun safety technology." Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms. "We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon. "It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ..." Harris cut him off, saying "sure, no one wants that to occur," and moved on. Holder’s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7 Washington Free Beacon story under the headline, "Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets." From there, it was picked up by Fox News, InfoWars, Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association, among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of "gun tracking bracelets." But the technology doesn’t track gun owners, and it doesn’t always require a bracelet. Smart guns and the Department of Justice Holder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. Obama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders, to release a report on gun safety technology "and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies." As he mentioned in his testimony, the department’s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House. Smart guns are also called "owner-authorized guns," "childproof guns" and "personalized guns." Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won’t if the owner is not recognized. Some high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond’s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand. "If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable," said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health. "If it’s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work." So the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect. The technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say. The point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a "scarlet letter" bracelet. Origins and controversies Teret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child’s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths. Manufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said. International companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399. This year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped. Here’s what the iP1 looks like: It’s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry, Bazinet said. It’s government’s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology. To Bazinet, smart guns won’t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want. Of course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin’s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was. Emails to Palin’s political action committee were not returned. Our ruling According to Palin, Holder recently revealed "this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner." That’s far from the truth. Holder said he wants the federal government to explore gun safety measures, including smart-gun technology that would prevent weapons from being fired by anyone except their rightful owner. The comment in question came as he explained why his agency is seeking federal money for grants to spur research into safer guns. He listed fingerprint identification and the gun talking "to a bracelet or something that you might wear" as tools that could prevent a gun owner’s firearm from being used by someone else. Some smart guns are powered by bracelets with embedded radio signal transmitters, but that’s just one way this could work. The purpose of accessories worn in order to fire a smart gun is not to help the government track owners or identify them (again, Holder is pursuing no such policy). The goal of the emerging technology is to minimize shootings caused by suicides, children or stolen guns. We rate Palin’s claim False.

pomt-14390	Says when Bernie Sanders was in college, Sanders said "something very similar" to what conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley had written as a college student in the 1990s -- that "women have a legitimate role in date rape."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/17/bill-mccoshen/bernie-sanders-made-rape-comment-similar-one-wisco/	In this item, we see if what conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote years ago about date rape is similar to something Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wrote years ago about rape fantasy. Yes, the 2016 campaign season has come to this. The claim we’re checking was made on March 11, 2016, at the end of a week in which Bradley was in the news for writings she did in college and for a case she handled as a private attorney. Bradley viewed the disclosures as aimed at boosting JoAnne Kloppenburg, a state appeals court judge and former Supreme Court candidate who is challenging Bradley in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election. The claim The claim we’re checking was made on "Here and Now," a Wisconsin Public Television public affairs program. There were two Madison-based guests: Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, which revealed Bradley’s college writings; and political consultant Bill McCoshen, a former Republican state official who said Bradley’s commentaries were written too long ago to be relevant. Ross said Bradley had written that "women have a legitimate role in date rape. I mean, these are ugly things to say. They're out of touch ..." McCoshen then interjected, saying: "By the way, that last comment -- Bernie Sanders said something very similar when he was in college, and he just won the Michigan Democratic primary. So, let’s have the same standard for all candidates for public office." Sanders’ comments about rape also were viewed by some as demeaning to women. It’s fair to say up front: Both Bradley’s and Sanders’ comments are open to interpretation. What Bradley wrote The 1992 student magazine column in question by Bradley (her maiden name was Grassl), who was 21 at the time, was an opinion piece against feminism, which she said "has adopted an agenda that no longer articulates the feelings of the average American woman; instead, it advocates the extremist platform of the issues advanced by the political left." The portion of the column highlighted by One Wisconsin Now referenced author Camille Paglia, a professor at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Bradley wrote that Paglia had been "prevented from speaking at several colleges" after Paglia "legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape." (In a column of her own published the previous year, Paglia had written: "A girl who lets herself get dead drunk at a fraternity party is a fool. A girl who goes upstairs alone with a brother at a fraternity party is an idiot. Feminists call this perspective ‘blaming the victim.’ I call it common sense.") Of Bradley’s column, One Wisconsin Now said: "It is abhorrent to blame the victim of a sexual assault, whatever the circumstances." So, in an anti-feminism column, Bradley stated that in her opinion, another writer "legitimately" suggested that women play a role in date rape. What Sanders wrote Sanders’ comments about rape were also in written in a newspaper column and also drew criticism -- although he made them at age 30, eight years after he graduated from the University of Chicago. The column generated news in the presidential campaign after it was referenced in a May 2015 profile about Sanders by the magazine Mother Jones. Sanders’ column was published in the Vermont Freeman alternative newspaper in 1972, the year he began running for public office. The column was about gender stereotypes and changing gender roles. But it started with what Sanders -- when the issue came up in the presidential campaign -- described as "bad fiction": "A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously …. Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like ‘Girl, 12, raped by 14 men’ sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?’’ New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, who McCoshen cited to back his claim, wrote in June 2015 that the column "disgusted" her, adding: "Did Sanders confess that he finds real-life instances of sexual violence against children titillating?" So, in a column about changing gender roles, Sanders made reference to a woman fantasizing about being gang raped. Our rating McCoshen says that when Sanders was in college, he said "something very similar" to what Bradley had written -- that "women have a legitimate role in date rape." Bradley was in college when, in an anti-feminism column, she wrote that a professor had "legitimately suggested that women play a role in date rape." Sanders was eight years out of college when he wrote in a column about gender roles: "A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.’’ So, both Sanders and Bradley wrote about rape in ways that were offensive to some women, although their columns were about different and broader topics.

pomt-14260	Says Hillary Clinton voted "for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/10/bernie-sanders/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/	The race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders heated up this week after a rhetorical spat over who was or wasn’t qualified to be president. It started when Clinton said Wednesday that Sanders "hadn’t done his homework and he’d been talking for more than a year about doing things that he obviously hadn’t really studied or understood." Responding to a Washington Post article that cast Clinton’s comments as questioning his qualifications, Sanders shot back, saying Clinton is the one who’s unqualified, upsetting Clinton’s supporters and former president-husband. The tiff leveled off Friday when Sanders took back his statement and said "of course" Clinton is qualified. But Sunday on Meet the Press, Sanders said his point all along was Clinton lacks good judgment. "Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs," he said, "when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water, and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country." There’s a lot to fact-check in this statement, but we were particularly curious about Sanders’ claim that Clinton supported "virtually every trade agreement." Sanders is exaggerating slightly, but he has a point that Clinton has been largely in favor of free trade. His claim that these deals have cost the country "millions of jobs" is up for debate. Clinton’s position on free trade Unlike Sanders’ two decades of consistent opposition to free trade agreement, Clinton has zigzagged through the years. "Some people are generally pro-trade or anti-trade. She’s case-by-case on trade," Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council in both the Clinton and Obama administrations, told the Washington Post last year. As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably in the 1990s and in the early 2000s of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed by President Bill Clinton. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History. As a senator from New York, Clinton had the opportunity to vote on 10 trade deals. She said yes to six and no to the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) and the deal with Andean countries. She skipped the votes on agreements with Jordan and Peru, which came up when she was running for president the first time, but supported both deals. Clinton explained her seemingly inconsistent positions in a 2005 speech to Congress: "The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement. Sadly, DR-CAFTA is a step backward." While the deals with Chile, Australia and Singapore similarly excluded labor rights standards, Clinton said she "supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations." However, Clinton (as well as then Rep. Sanders) voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which expanded duty-free exports from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru and gave President George W. Bush "fast-track authority" to approve trade deals with South American countries. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Clinton supported normalizing trade relations with China while campaigning for Senate in 2000, and, once elected, she also voted for legislation that included an amendment granting Vietnam normalized trade status. (Sanders voted against both.) As a presidential candidate in 2008, Clinton had varying opinions on various trade deals, and she changed her position on NAFTA. She called NAFTA "a mistake" and opposed pending deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. She reiterated her support for free trade with Peru on the campaign trail. "I support the trade agreement with Peru. It has very strong labor and environmental protections. This agreement makes meaningful progress on advancing workers’ rights, and also levels the playing field for American workers," she said in 2007. "The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers. I am very concerned about the history of violence against trade unionists in Colombia. And as long as the head of Panama's National Assembly is a fugitive from justice in America, I cannot support that agreement." As secretary of state, Clinton walked back her opposition to deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and helped negotiate them as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Clinton has reiterated her opposition to CAFTA and flip-flopped on her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Employment impact unclear The debate over the impact of trade deals on employment has been waging for decades, and the jury is still out. On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a 2003 report would kill an unspecified number of jobs. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over 800,000 jobs and the South Korean deal about 60,000. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China. Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs. Meanwhile, the U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. And in a recent fact-check, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. Analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals. Our ruling Sander said Clinton voted "for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs." Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn’t vote but did vouch for them. As for Sanders’ point about subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs.

pomt-03673	Says the U.S. fleet of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the 48 boats that Navy says it needs to carry out current missions.	true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/26/randy-forbes/forbes-says-us-attack-sub-fleet-will-fall-below-na/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, has never been shy about seeking money for the Navy. He represents a district that’s anchored in Hampton Roads, home to the world’s largest naval base and two of the nation’s busiest shipyards. In an April 9 op-ed, Forbes and Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., called for more funding to replace the nation’s aging fleet of attack submarines, or SSNs. The column appeared on AOL Defense, a website that describes itself as "the idea hub of the U.S. defense world." Forbes and Courtney wrote, "The Navy has stated it requires 48 SSNs to execute current missions, but given the current rates of replacement, the SSN force is scheduled to drop below the stated minimum in less than a decade." They wrote, "All Americans should be gravely concerned" by the loss of national security that will be caused by the diminution of the fleet. The attack subs, which cost about $2.6 billion apiece, are sent on a variety of missions, including intelligence, mine warfare, anti-submarine, anti-ship, small-scale special forces insertion and land target strikes. We decided to check their claim that the number of attack submarines is scheduled to fall below the Navy’s required level in less than a deacde. Forbes’ office referred us to two studies published in March by the Congressional Research Service and documents from the Department of Defense in 2010 and 2012. The Navy, since 2006, has said it needs 48 attack submarines to carry out its missions, according to a CRS report released March 27. So Forbes is right on that part of his claim. The Navy now has 55 attack subs, but these nuclear-powered vessels have about a 30-year lifespan. In a nutshell, the SSNs are scheduled to be retired during the next 22 years at a faster pace than the nation will replace them. The Navy’s long-range plan calls for scrapping about three submarines annually for a number of years and replacing them with one or two new subs. Forbes based his column on Navy projections released last year. They showed that the number of attack subs would sink below the 48-ship standard in 2022 and not resurface to that level until 2035. Forbes’ claim that the fleet would fall below the Navy’s stated need "in less than a decade" was based on the best information available at the time his op-ed was published. The Navy has since updated its 30-year projections to fit into the federal budget proposed by President Barack Obama on April 10. The Navy said its attack sub force wouldn’t fall under the 48-ship threshold until 2025 and would stay below that level for 10 years. The Navy would hit bottom in 2029, with 42 SSNs. Forbes, who is chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, has scheduled hearings on the Navy’s shipbuilding plan. He has urged Congress to ensure that at least two new attack subs are produced every year. The decline in the SSN fleet, Forbes says, particularly threatens U.S. intelligence and security operations in East Asia and the Western Pacific, where China is becoming increasingly dominant. Eric Wertheim, author of "Combat Fleets of the World" and an expert on global sea power, told us it’s hard assess the degree of threat the reduction of the SSN fleet poses to U.S. security. "What the Navy and military are trying to do is have a balanced force," he said. "They plan to respond and be ready for any kind of operation, whether it’s low-intensity, such as Libya, peacetime activities, like intelligence or a high-intensity operation, such as is possible with places like China." Wertheim said it doesn’t necessarily mean that the U.S. won’t be able to carry out missions with a reduced attack sub fleet but, in military planners’ minds, there are increased risks that it won’t be able to respond to all threats. "The question for them is what amount of risk are we willing to take," he said. "We don’t know what we’ll need until the future comes." Our ruling Forbes wrote that the nation’s fleet of attack submarines is scheduled, in less than a decade, to fall below the 48 boats the Navy says it needs to carry out current missions. The congressman accurately cited the best information that was available when his column was published on April 9. Since then, the Navy has issued new projections that say the fleet won’t fall below 48 SSNs until 2025. We don’t fault Forbes for not knowing information that wasn’t available at the time. We rate his statement True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2013-04-26T06:00:00	2013-04-09	['United_States']
pomt-01039	Mercedes-Benz USA moving its headquarters to Atlanta will create at least 800 jobs.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/26/nathan-deal/mercedes-move-will-create-jobs/	The 2014 governor’s race spotlighted two diametrically opposed facts about Georgia’s economy: Different groups ranked the state tops for business at the same time the state had the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Georgia’s unemployment rate tumbled to 6.9 percent in December (from 7.2 percent in November), and in January, Mercedes-Benz USA announced it was moving its headquarters to metro Atlanta. Newly re-elected Gov. Nathan Deal touted the move in a press release as "creating at least 800 jobs" while repeating the state’s top-ranked business environment. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that meant the move would create jobs to nudge the needle on Georgia’s unemployment rate – still stubbornly well above the national 5.6 unemployment rate. In other words, is moving jobs – in this case, from New Jersey – the same as creating them? First, it’s worth noting that the 800 figure comes from an incentive letter from the Georgia Department of Economic Development to Mercedes. The state is offering a package of grants, tax credits and "cost avoidances" worth $23.3 million. Mercedes-Benz USA CEO Steve Cannon has told several media outlets that the firm expects about 40 percent of its workers to relocate to Atlanta. Using the 800 figure, that means 320 people will move and the firm will need to hire for 480 jobs. So does that translate into "creating" 800 jobs? Absolutely, said state Economic Development Commissioner Chris Carr. After all, once the auto company sets up shop here this summer, there will be at least 800 jobs that today don’t exist. It’s a net increase of positions, and in an industry that has gradually shifted to the southeast for its manufacturing and office operations. "This puts Georgia high on the radar for the automotive industry and also for German companies," Carr said. "Whether a Georgian here or new Georgian, Georgians would not have that job except for the sake that Mercedes will move here." The qualifier of "at least" 800 jobs shows the state is looking at the tax credits as an investment, Carr said. "You have to play for the long game," he said. To an economist, the claim is accurate-ish. Once Mercedes moves here, the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics will show it as 800 jobs in Georgia. Those jobs will do the things economists study, like boost demand for housing and increase tax collections on the state and local level, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University. That said, it’s incorrect to imply the move means 800 jobs for current Georgians, Seaman said. "We should be happy, not euphoric. We could be euphoric if this was creating 800 opportunities for existing Georgians," he said. The distinction between those soon-to-be Georgians and the folks who already know the pain that is rush hour on the top-end Perimeter? The folks here are the ones paying the taxes that fund those incentives and might wonder what’s in it for them. Georgia’s generous incentives to the film industry answer the question. There was no doubt that most of the jobs tied, say, to Jennifer Lawrence’s first days filming in Bellwood Quarry, came from California. But Seaman said the state’s investment has also created a growing demand for Georgians who know how to do work in that industry, not to mention private-sector investments in sound stages and studios. "Over time, it is an investment that can pay off," Seaman said. "I think it’s a good thing for the state." The bottom line is, claiming Mercedes’ move will create 800 jobs is generally correct but lacking in context. If you’re an unemployed Georgian today, you likely have a shot at 480 Mercedes job openings, not 800. But there should still be 800 jobs, once it’s all said and done. And that alone could spur more work. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2015-01-26T00:00:00	2015-01-13	['United_States', 'Atlanta']
pomt-06043	"One year today since #GOP took control of the House" and "no new jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/13/frank-pallone-jr/frank-pallone-says-twitter-republicans-have-contro/	A Democratic congressman from New Jersey took a jab at his Republican colleagues to mark the one-year anniversary of GOP control in the House of Representatives. In exactly 140 characters, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) reminded his more than 5,000 Twitter followers last week of what one year of Republican rule has reaped. "One year today since #GOP took control of the House. One full year of obstruction & no new jobs. #WeCan’tWait. Get back to work no-show GOP!" Pallone’s Jan. 5 tweet said. No new jobs, really? Actually, the United States has added more than a million jobs in the last year. From December 2010 to December 2011, the country gained 1.64 million jobs, according to the most recent federal employment data. And there’s been job creation, month over month, for the past 15 months. We’re not crediting Congressional Republicans with that job growth. As we’ve noted before: there’s a variety of factors that contribute to job creation, and it’s difficult to nail down a specific catalyst. Still, to say there’s been "no new jobs" is clearly wrong. A written statement from the congressman’s office said, in part, that Pallone "tweeted a message decrying the consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs and address the unemployment crisis that has continued to plague our struggling economy. In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work." In response to a follow-up question that asked whether Pallone concedes the tweet wasn’t intended to say there’s actually been "no new jobs," the congressman’s spokesman wrote: "We stand by the statement issued earlier, which clearly states our position." "In the full year since Republicans have taken control of Congress, they have refused to propose any serious jobs plan to get Americans back to work," the statement said. "House Republicans have not only failed to make any progress on measures to create jobs, they have voted against Democrats’ job creation proposals 17 times." It’s worth noting that PolitiFact National checked a related statement made in Facebook posts that claimed Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation." PolitiFact noted that what defines a job creation bill is up for significant debate. Still, they ruled the statement Pants on Fire largely because the methodology behind the figure also excluded President Barack Obama’s "American Jobs Act" as a "job creation" bill. Our ruling A tweet posted on Pallone’s account on Jan. 5 said it’s "one year today since #GOP took control of the House" and "no new jobs." A written statement from Pallone’s office said the tweet decried "consistent Republican inaction in Congress on moving a meaningful agenda to create jobs." But "no new jobs" isn’t the same as a "no new jobs agenda" and the U.S. gained 1.64 million of the former in the last year. Yes, there’s a limit of 140 characters on Twitter, but there’s still room for accuracy. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01412	Michelle Nunn ranks agriculture issues as the 18th most important items facing Georgia.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/10/david-perdue/perdues-agriculture-against-nunn-claim-base/	Candidate references to the family farm and toting watermelons are far more than folksy. Agriculture is Georgia’s top industry, pumping more than $71 billion a year into the state economy. In that context, talking farms is political calculus, especially in farm heavy Middle Georgia. That math was on display in its full glory at the state fair this week in Perry, where U.S. Senate hopefuls Michelle Nunn and David Perdue debated for the first time. "How do you justify to the farmers that in your list of priorities there are 17 items more important than the farmers in this state?" Perdue, the Republican asked his Democratic opponent. Nunn appeared confused by the question and called the claim untrue. "There is no plan that has that listed," Nunn said. Considering that the winner of the race will replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer who spent his Congressional career on agriculture committees, PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the facts behind the political theater. First, some background. Nunn and Perdue are both political novices who lay some claim to rural Georgia. Nunn spent the first six years of her life in Perry, before her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. The family still owns a farm in the area. Perdue also is a Middle Georgia native. An ad featuring his cousin, ex-Gov. Sonny Perdue, talks up that background and youth spent "pickin’ watermelons." Both candidates have met with the clout-wielding Georgia Farm Bureau, which does not endorse candidates. Both have said they will seek seats on the Senate agriculture committee if elected. Perdue’s television ads have long featured him wearing a jean jacket, walking in a rural field. His platform includes reducing regulations facing farmers, to help boost production. "I hope to bring fresh ideas that will help relieve burdensome regulations and ensure our local farmers succeed in growing a strong Georgia," Perdue said in an August press release. Perdue’s criticism against Nunn’s agriculture credentials is based on two pages out of 144 pages of Nunn campaign memos that were produced in December 2013 and leaked this summer. Starting on page 61 are several policy issues that call for background memos for the candidate and her staff to review. Listed in order of need for completion, agriculture ranks 18, after issues as varied as the budget and the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. "It is absolutely clear that’s how she ranks agriculture on her list of priorities on what to discuss," Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. The memo appears to contradict that interpretation, however. The document bolds the word "agriculture," a sign from the authors that the policy paper on the issue is either done or near completion. Policy papers on issues that are ranked higher in the memo, such as the budget, are not bolded and therefore still in process. Nunn spokesman Nathan Click said that’s because the issues were not listed in order of importance but as "topics the consultants want addressed." Click said Nunn made her commitment to agriculture clear when, within a week of announcing her candidacy in July 2013, she told reporters her goal was to serve on the Senate Agriculture and Armed Services committees. Her father, Sam Nunn, was chair of the armed service committee during his 24-year tenure in the Senate. Nunn’s seven-page jobs plan includes a call to expand partnerships between state universities and farmers among other priorities such as tax reform. "My family has a third generation farm in Perry, and we have grown and raised everything from pecans to peppers to pigs – if you count our farm pig, Maybeline," Nunn said during a visit to the Georgia Farm Bureau in February. "I understand how important our agriculture community is to our economy and our heritage as Georgians." So where does that leave us? It is accurate that agriculture is listed as 18 out of 22 policy memos that need completing, according to leaked internal campaign documents. But there is no evidence to support the idea that the list is a ranking of Nunn’s priorities. Perdue’s statement ignores critical facts and is misleading on its face. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08477	Shows in a television ad that police took evidence from Solantic, Rick Scott's new health care company, after allegations emerged that the company was engaging in fraud.	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/problems-rick-scotts-new-health-care-business-sola/	Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute campaign ad that tries to link Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott to alleged fraud at a urgent patient care business he founded in 2001, Solantic. The spot, called "Fraud Files," opens more like an introduction to a Dateline NBC episode than a campaign commercial, mixing a narrator's voice with short clips from TV. The first half of the ad deals with Scott's time running Columbia/HCA. The second half talks about Solantic, the company he built after resigning from Columbia/HCA. "In 2008, new allegations emerged that Solantic was also engaging in multiple forms of fraud," the narrator says over visuals of flapping yellow sheriff's police tape, a detective in a suit taking notes and men in police T-shirts carrying boxes out of a building. The ad essentially is blending together two fraud allegations. The first is a 2008 lawsuit filed by Dr. P. Mark Glencross. Glencross alleged that Solantic improperly used his medical license in 2004 when the company filed paperwork saying each clinic had a medical director in charge. Scott was deposed during the case -- Scott has declined to release that deposition. The two-year-old case was settled within a month of Scott's deposition and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement. The second stems from allegations by another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes. During the gubernatorial primary, Prokes sent an e-mail to Bill McCollum's Republican campaign for governor claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations. The McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general’s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's where the letter sits today. The Department of Health and Human Services has not said whether it's investigating Prokes' claims. The claims of fraud are real, but suggesting through images that police raided or seized records from Solantic is entirely misleading. Ads are about both the visuals and the words campaigns choose. In this case, the Democratic Party is inflating the allegations against Solantic by including video of sheriff's tape and police collecting evidence. There have been no reports that we could find of police raiding a Solantic facility, and the Democratic Party, when asked, could provide no evidence of any such search. As such, we rate this claim False.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-10-12T17:34:34	2010-10-10	['None']
pomt-13551	Chicago Public Schools "lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system," "match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college," and are "producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/25/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-scores-well-cps-test/	In June, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner called some Chicago Public Schools "crumbling prisons," and then five-year-old emails from when he was in private business revealed he’d also called principals "managerially incompetent" and half its teachers "virtually illiterate." Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could not let the moment pass, even as he said he was accepting Rauner’s apology for the remarks. At a press event after Rauner’s email comments were released, Emanuel used the opportunity to boast about CPS students’ achievements. "Well, let me tell you what the [Chicago Public Schools] ‘crumbling prisons’ with wardens as principals and guards as teachers have done. They lead the country in high school graduation of an urban school system…They now match the United States of America in kids graduating high school going on to a four-year college...That same prison with that same warden and that same security guard is also producing eighth-grade leaders in the country in math gains, fourth-grade leaders in reading gains." That’s a lot to study, so we decided to do our homework. Testing the claims Lauren Huffman, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, noted Emanuel often repeats those claims, citing statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The NAEP calls itself the largest, continuing organization that tests students in a variety of subjects. It is under the umbrella of the National Center for Education Statistics run by the federal education department. We were able to verify the mayor’s claims about eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading by examining "The Nation’s Report Card" for 2016 and the Trial Urban District Assessment published by the NAEP, and by interviewing Grady Wilburn, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics. Wilburn said Chicago’s fourth-grade reading score had improved 15 points since 2003, the second-highest improvement behind Washington, D.C., which improved 26 points. Since 2013, Chicago improved 7 percentage points and tied for first place with Washington, Cleveland and Boston. While the chart shows numerically that D.C. is higher, it does not account for statistical significance. Wilburn said when districts are tested for statistical significance, Washington, Cleveland and Chicago are not different from each other. Significance testing considers sampling error associated with only assessing a portion of students, not all of them. In eighth-grade reading, Wilburn said scores show Emanuel’s statement to be accurate. Since 2003, he said, eighth-grade CPS math scores have improved 20 percentage points. They are statistically tied for highest gains since 2003. They’re tied with Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles. If you look just at 2013-15, Chicago’s scores went up 6 percentage points, and that is the biggest gain. Of the 21 urban districts monitored, CPS students were the only ones to improve in eighth-grade math from 2013 to 2015. Passing or surpassing? Emanuel made two other claims about Chicago Public School students. One of the claims was that they now match the nation in kids graduating high school and going on to a four-year college. The Chicago Consortium on School Research at the University of Chicago published a new study in June that examined high school graduation, college enrollment and bachelor’s degree attainment rates. Chicago Public Schools’ "four-year college enrollment rate for 2014 is 42 percent, two percentage points lower than the national rate, and half of CPS graduates who enroll in four-year colleges will graduate in six years," a summary of the report says. Two percentage points lower than the nation in college enrollment would indicate Emanuel’s statement is slightly off, but it is clear CPS graduation rates, college enrollment and degree attainment have been rising significantly. In 2006, the graduation and college enrollment rate was eight percent. In nine years, by 2015, that rate had doubled to 16 percent. Emanuel’s other claim, that CPS leads the nation among urban districts for high school graduation, was more difficult to verify. The National Center for Education Statistics put the adjusted cohort graduation rate at 82 percent for 2013-14. Jenny Nagaoka, deputy director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research and an author of the study of CPS college attainment, said the CPS rate for the same year is 74 percent, but she cautioned the two institutions might rely on districts that calculate rates differently. Unlike reading and math scores, there doesn’t appear to be a comparison of urban district graduation rates. In 2012, she said CPS was "probably in the middle of the pack" nationally. "On the basis of this, I can’t conclusively say this is a true or false statement," she said. "CPS is certainly higher than Baltimore. We may be higher than New York. CPS is certainly higher than many. Chicago has made great gains. We’ve really closed the gap compared to the national rate and that’s important." Chicago’s improvement in graduation rate comes at a time when, nationally the rate also has been climbing. "It is a big accomplishment to improve the gap when the national rate also is improving," Nagaoka said. Our ruling Emanuel’s boasts about reading and math scores compared to other urban districts were accurate. His statement about going on to four-year college was a bit off, but probably not statistically significant. We could not find data to conclusively verify that CPS leads urban districts nationwide in its graduation rate, but it has made dramatic improvement. A similar study from the consortium concludes, "While changes in student demographics account for some of the increase in graduation rates, improvements in student performance in high school — compared to similar students who started high school in the past — accounts for most of the change; students are passing more classes and earning more credits in ninth grade. Not only are more students graduating, but they are leaving high school with higher achievement than graduates in prior years.

pomt-10993	"Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jul/12/kendall-scudder/kendall-scudder-says-bob-hall-hasnt-passed-bill-la/	A North Texas Democrat nominated for the Texas Senate told a Dallas crowd that the incumbent, Bob Hall of Edgewood, has an empty legislative record. Kendall Scudder of Sulphur Springs said at a July 2, 2018, event noted by the Dallas Morning News: "None of you should be surprised to find out that Bob Hall never successfully passed a bill before. And we're going to keep it that way." Hall, a businessman who joined the Senate’s ruling Republicans in 2015, told the newspaper: "I'm not one to try to get my name in lights when it comes to passing bills. I see myself as part of a team." Still, has Hall not advanced any of his own measures into law? Records show a Hall proposal advancing into law Before reaching Scudder, we gauged Hall’s record by searching the Texas Legislature Online website maintained by the Texas Legislative Council. Our searches for proposals authored by Hall that Gov. Greg Abbott signed or let into law showed one such accomplishment. In the 2017 regular session, the Hall-authored Senate Bill 102, clarifying position titles in the Texas National Guard, made it through the Senate and House and was signed into law on June 1, 2017. Hall said in a June 2017 statement of intent filed with the proposal that lawmakers previously created new general officer positions within the Texas National Guard but the federal government didn’t recognize or fund the position titles. "This bill would clarify these new general officer titles and duties to allow for proper recognition and funding," Hall said. Hall otherwise authored 52 proposals in 2015 and 69 more in 2017, records indicate. Put another way, about 1 percent of his authored legislation made it into law. Yet that rate doesn't capture Hall's full legislative record. In the regular sessions and a summer 2017 special session, records show, Hall co-sponsored measures offered by others--some of which passed into law. In 2015, Hall was a co-sponsor of seven House bills that passed into law and in 2017, Hall co-sponsored three House measures in the regular session that made it into law and three House proposals that passed into law after action in the special session. Scudder, responding by email, told us his point in Dallas was that Hall hasn’t been effective. "I was specifically referring to Sen. Hall's inability to pass legislation benefiting his district as a primary author (in short stump speeches, it can be difficult to specifically outline the intricacies of legislative processes)," Scudder wrote. Our ruling Scudder said Hall has never passed a bill. Hall's had scant success ushering his own measures into law. Still, he authored a 2017 proposal clarifying Texas National Guard titles that passed into law. He's separately cosponsored other proposals now in statute. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14716	By the end of 2015, more than 1,300 people will have died on Georgia roads. One of out evey four fatalities resulted from drunken driving.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/dec/30/state-public-service-announcement/state-correct-traffic-deaths-are-2015/	More than 1,300 people have died on Georgia roads this year, and 25 percent of the deaths are the result of drunken driving. Those claims headline a public service announcement airing statewide on television and radio in this season of merriment and cheer. "Watch your speed. Put down the phone, and don’t get behind the wheel if you’ve been drinking," Gov. Nathan Deal warns listeners. For months, state officials have been alert to an unwelcome change: After falling annually for nine straight years, Georgia’s traffic deaths were up this year. But have more than 1,300 people really died this year on Georgia roads? And have 25 percent — or one out of four of those deaths — been caused by drunken driving, as the public service announcement says? PolitiFact Georgia decided to rev up the Truth-O-Meter. Figures compiled by the state Department of Transportation and released through the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety show traffic deaths in Georgia fell each year from 2005 to 2014, going from 1,729 to 1,170, even as U.S. census estimates show the state added about 1 million residents. Georgia roadway deaths for 2015 hit 1,345 as of Monday of this week. That's up 186, or 16 percent, from 2014, and it’s still a few days until we turn the calendar to 2016. According to state data, the 1,345 included six people killed in car-train collisions, 192 pedestrians, 138 motorcyclists and 21 bicyclists. The largest number of traffic deaths occurred on state and local roads, 675 and 485, respectively. But deaths on interstates — often the most visible because of the gridlock that follows — are up 21 percent, from 153 in 2014 to 185 so far this year. But were 25 percent of this year's fatalities alcohol-related? The answer: That could well be the case, but officials don’t know that with absolute certainty. Harris Blackwood, the director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said his agency has certified data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showing that 297 of Georgia’s 1,179 fatalities two years ago, or 25 percent, involved alcohol blood content of 0.08, the legal limit. Smaller amounts of alcohol — 0.01 percent or higher — were found in 30 percent, or 349, of those fatalities in 2013, Blackwood said. Part of the reason they don’t know for certain about the role of alcohol in 2015 traffic deaths is it can take months to obtain blood test results from the GBI crime lab, he said. "However, there are indicators, such as open containers, information provided by other passengers, and so on," Blackwood said. "The percentage of alcohol as a factor has been consistent on a percentage basis over a 10-year period, even as fatalities were going down prior to this year," he said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website gives an extensive five-year view of fatal crashes in Georgia and the nation — including the role alcohol plays. Between 2010 and 2014, alcohol-impaired driving was a factor in 24 percent to 25 percent of all fatal accidents each year. The one exception was 2011, when the percentage dropped to 22 percent. Nationally, 30 percent to 31 percent of all fatalities in those same five years involved alcohol-impaired drivers (those with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or above), according to the NHTSA data. Blackwood said the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety also did a preliminary analysis early this year and found no evidence that "the alcohol percentage is going down" from prior years. In the first nine months of 2015, there were 483 instances where an officer requested an alcohol test or a driver refused an alcohol test, he said. (We should note that some law enforcement agencies consider it standard protocol to request a blood alcohol test in fatal traffic accidents.) Our ruling A public service announcement says more than 1,300 people will die on Georgia roads before the end of the year. By Monday of this week, the number was 1,345, according to a tally kept by the Georgia Department of Transportation and released by the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. The PSA also makes the claim that one in four of those people died in alcohol-impaired fatalities. The truth is that state officials don’t know for certain what’s happened in these traffic deaths. It takes time to investigate. They’re basing the claim on a trend they’ve seen and one that doesn’t seem to be changing in Georgia or the nation. That’s probably context the reader deserves to know.

pomt-01421	Muslim nations did not "call out" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/08/bill-oreilly/oreilly-no-muslim-government-called-out-those-who-/	Bill Maher, cable show host and ardent atheist, ignited a cable television free-for-all when he said the Muslim world has "too much in common with ISIS." ISIS, of course, is one of the names for the forces of the Islamic State group which has engaged in beheadings and mass executions with ghastly regularity. Liberals have been critical of Maher for, they say, making sweeping generalizations of Muslims. Conservatives, meanwhile, have come to Maher’s defense. On Fox News, host Bill O’Reilly delivered one of his Talking Points commentaries on the question of whether Islam is a destructive force in the world. To a significant degree, O’Reilly answered in the affirmative. Among his reasons -- the governments of Muslim-majority nations have "failed to confront Islamic terrorism (and) have not attacked violence in the name of Allah." O’Reilly then played video that featured Palestinian youngsters jumping and smiling as news spread of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "Thousands of Muslims, regular folks, celebrated in the streets," O’Reilly said. "They were happy that more than 3,000 innocent people, including Muslims, were murdered. Again, these people are a minority but they were not called out in any official way by Muslim nations around the world." O’Reilly is correct that public demonstrations in support of the 9/11 attacks took place. They largely occurred in the Palestinian territories, although we also found reports of one in Egypt. Middle East specialist Peter Mandaville, associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University, recalls them as "small scale and localized." But our fact-check is focused on the question of whether Muslim nations repudiated the celebrations. "There was a report of (the) Palestinian Authority information minister at the time, Yaseer Abed Rabbo, appealing to Palestinians to not show happiness in response to the attacks, but no specific condemnation that I know of," Mandaville said. We found a couple of compilations of Muslim reaction in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. In addition to Mandaville, we contacted several researchers who study the Middle East. We found no instance when the government of a Muslim-majority nation chastised or condemned the people who were elated by the toppling of the World Trade towers and the other deadly events of that day. What we did find were many official condemnations of the attacks themselves. King Abdullah II of Jordan said, "What these people stand for is completely against all the principles that Arab Muslims believe in." The day after the attacks, Abdelouahed Belkeziz, Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, issued a statement saying he was "denouncing and condemning those criminal and brutal acts that ran counter to all covenants, humanitarian values and divine religions foremost among which was Islam." The Organization of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) represents all of the Muslim nations in the Middle East and worldwide. The group later issued a joint statement that spoke to "the necessity of tracking down the perpetrators of these acts in the light of the results of investigations and bringing them to justice to inflict on them the penalty they deserve." The League of Arab States said much the same thing, as did Islamic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and other countries. From Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and other nations, over 40 clerics and Islamic-oriented party leaders -- many with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that advocates for Sharia law -- signed a statement on Sept. 12, 2011, saying, "We condemn, in the strongest terms, the incidents which are against all human and Islamic norms. This is grounded in the Noble Laws of Islam which forbid all forms of attacks on innocents." So while it’s true that governments did not speak out against the jubilant Palestinians, there was broad rejection of the attacks from officials and top religious leaders. Nathan Brown, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, raised the possibility that the street celebrations loomed larger in America than elsewhere. "I remember them being reported in U.S. media since they seemed so outrageous," Brown said. "But I do not know if they got any domestic attention in the countries where they were reported in U.S. media to have occurred. For instance, I remember Palestinian media reporting the blood donation made by Yasser Arafat but not anything about Palestinian celebrations." Arafat had a photo-op with him donating blood to help the survivors of the 9/11 attacks, although later reports questioned whether he actually did. We did find several accounts of the Palestinian authorities attempting to seize video of the demonstrations, which could speak to how the events might have played in the region. Dubai-based Media Watch Middle East is a private firm that tracks the activities of news organizations throughout the region. We asked them to look for coverage of the celebrations. They reported that an "extensive search" of their database turned up nothing. Apart from official reaction, average Muslims attended candlelight vigils and other public events to voice sympathy for the victims and to repudiate the attacks. We found photos from Iran and Bangladesh. These demonstrations stand in sharp contrast to the video from the Palestinian territories. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Muslim nations did not "call out" the people who celebrated the 9/11 attacks. So far as we can tell, there was no official condemnation of people celebrating the 9/11 attacks. However, Muslim governments, and religious leaders, condemned the attacks themselves, as did many average Muslims. O’Reilly’s statement is accurate as far as it goes, but it leaves out important information that might lead someone to reach a different conclusion. That meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-13003	"House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/blog-posting/websites-revive-claim-house-democrats-strike-impos/	Several websites continue to insist without a shred of evidence that Democrats in the U.S. House have attempted to enact Sharia law, the religious guidelines of Islam. "THIS IS TREASON!!" exclaimed one headline we saw on Dec. 12, 2016. "House DEMOCRATS STRIKE To IMPLEMENT SHARIA LAW!!" A Dec. 12 Facebook post linked to an undated story that referred to a third outlet going back to December 2015. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com First of all, there was no strike, either as a work stoppage or an attack. The citations refer to the Dec. 17, 2015, introduction of HR 569, which sought to support Muslim-Americans and denounce hate crimes and persecution. One story we found online said the resolution "threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islam’s reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place." Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. PolitiFact has checked a string of complaints about efforts to institute Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States — most recently by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the potential future national security adviser of President-elect Donald Trump. But the resolution, introduced by U.S. Rep. Donald Beyer of Virginia, did not seek to institute Sharia law, or any law, for that matter. The resolution was non-binding, meaning it did not have the effect of law, and was introduced to address an upswing in anti-Muslim sentiment. HR 569 has 145 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats. Some online stories distorted what the bill would do by saying it "will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of ‘Islamophobia’ may be introduced" and single out only Muslims as worthy of special protection. Some websites said the resolution would equate hate speech with violence, and that would potentially alter constitutional rights. But HR 569 "declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of all United States citizens, including Muslims in the United States, should be protected and preserved." The resolution denounces "the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim." It also "steadfastly confirms its dedication to the rights and dignity of all its citizens of all faiths, beliefs, and cultures." There’s no threat of new legal reprisal for intolerance against Muslims, only that Congress would officially disapprove of such behavior. The aim was for Congress to show support for "the inalienable right of every citizen to live without fear and intimidation, and to practice their freedom of faith." The resolution was referred to committee. With no Republican co-sponsors in the GOP-controlled House, it likely will not see any further action. Our ruling Bloggers said, "House Democrats strike to implement Sharia law!!" There was no kind of strike. Instead, the stories referred to a non-binding resolution introduced in December 2015 that sought to affirm congressional support for Muslim-Americans facing hate crimes and persecution. It did not have the effect of law or mention Sharia law, but rather aimed to send a message that anti-Muslim sentiment would not be tolerated by members of the U.S. House. The resolution has not received any Republican support and is likely dead. Wanting Congress to officially condemn hate speech and persecution is not the same as seeking to institute Sharia law.

pomt-09154	"Across the country, more than half of the U.S. attorney seats remain without a prosecutor chosen by Obama."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/10/thomas-melsheimer/dallas-lawyers-say-cornyn-among-republicans-keepin/	Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn draws fire in a recently published opinion piece pointing out that the four chief federal prosecutor positions in Texas have yet to be filled by lawyers of Democratic President Barack Obama's choosing. Two Democrats, Dallas lawyer Thomas Melsheimer and Craig Smith, a state district judge, said in an op-ed article in Monday's Austin American-Statesman that Cornyn's insistence on holding sway over the U.S. attorney appointments in Texas has kept them from happening. "Obama should be allowed to select a competent nominee of his choice without Cornyn's blessing on the front end," they write. Other Senate Republicans are similarly thwarting the president, they suggest. "Across the country," they write, "more than half of the U.S. attorney seats remain without a prosecutor chosen by Obama." Really? We reached Melsheimer, who said he based the less-than-half claim on information provided by the interim U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, James T. Jacks. We couldn't reach Jacks, but Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, told us Obama appointees have been confirmed as U.S. attorneys for 51 of the nation's 93 districts. A U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary web page lists the U.S. attorneys nominated by Obama and confirmed by the Senate. Fifty-one of 93 equals 55 percent, not "less than half." According to the Senate committee list, the last time that Obama appointees occupied less than half the U.S. attorney slots was early May. His 47th U.S. attorney nominee was confirmed with others May 5; three more nominees were confirmed May 25, nearly two weeks before the oped was published. Still, we wondered if there's a legitimate beef with Cornyn, who serves on the judiciary committee, and if it matters when the leadership posts are filled by civil-service lawyers instead of presidential appointees. Some perspective: Traditionally, the U.S. attorney posts turn over with each change in president. Though nationally, a handful of the top prosecutors appointed by President George W. Bush remain in place, the Bush appointees in Texas are gone, replaced by career Department of Justice lawyers considered temporary holders of the plum posts pending the arrival of Obama's choices. Cornyn said Wednesday he's falsely accused of blocking nominees and that the president has been slow to put names forward. Generally, he said, "we're working in good faith together to try to fill as many of these vacancies as we can." It's the Senate's role to confirm each president's nominees. For judicial-related appointments, Cornyn and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, rely on their own advisory committee to guide them on who to recommend the president name to federal judgeships and U.S. attorney posts in Texas. Last year, the committee was expanded to include Democratic-leaning lawyers. But the White House earlier said it would not choose anyone without a sign-off from the state's Democratic House members, who have elected as their chair U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin. In a March 2009 statement, the White House said Cornyn and Hutchison "will be accorded a full opportunity to share their views about each candidate whom the president proposes to nominate." But the statement also said: "No federal judge, U.S. attorney or U.S. marshal will be nominated by the president, however, unless that person has the confirmed support of the Texas Democratic delegation." Doggett said this week that a tradition hearkening to Republican Ronald Reagan's presidency grants appointment sway to House members from the president's party in states lacking members of the president's party in the Senate. The House Democrats have recommended various Texans to Obama for federal judgeships, U.S. marshal positions and each U.S. attorney slot. With competing groups seeking to be the clearinghouse for nominees, the situation seems ripe for standoffs. One element: House Democrats favor one candidate to be U.S. attorney for the state's Dallas-based Northern District, while Cornyn and Hutchison have aligned behind another. Meanwhile, the president's only announced choice for a U.S. attorney post in Texas, nominated in February, withdrew in April, telling a Beaumont TV station he'd decided to remain a state district judge, indicating impatience with the process. "There is no timetable for a decision on the nomination," the station quoted John Stevens, the nominee, saying. "It's just sitting there. It seems like there ought to be a quicker method." Far as we can tell, the White House has not spoken out lately about its Texas appointments. This week, an Obama spokesman didn't immediately have a comment. Doggett noted that besides the lack of Obama's U.S. attorney appointees in Texas, seven Texas judicial posts wait to be filled. Doggett said Cornyn has played a delaying role, though the White House shares blame. "As long as the White House doesn't put a high priority on (filling the openings), the (GOP) senators are only encouraged to be obstructive," Doggett said. UPDATE, 2:38 p.m. June 11, 2010: After we posted this article, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that Obama, in consultation with state congressional delegations, has nominated a steady stream of candidates for U.S. attorney posts "at a pace similar to that of previous administrations." He said that through June 9, Obama had nominated 72 individuals as U.S. attorneys, with 51 confirmed by the Senate and two having withdrawn. Bush had made 83 nominations by the same point in his first term, with 75 confirmed and two having withdrawn. And at the same point of his first term, President Bill Clinton had nominated 83 U.S. attorneys with 81 confirmed. Nobody we queried had objections to staff lawyers filling in as U.S. attorneys until the political appointments are made. Does the delay make a difference? It matters, Doggett said, because a presidential appointee can be counted on to carry out administration priorities. "If a U.S. attorney has consistently under the Bush administration ignored violations concerning polluting our waterways and oceans," Doggett said, "and somebody under the Obama administration thinks it's time to give that attention and prioritize, that's a good example of why it makes a difference." Attorney Richard Roper, Bush's appointed U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas through 2008, agreed, saying political appointees -- "somebody on the president's team and the attorney general's team" help make sure "all priorities of the attorney general are being carried out." As for the lawyers' statement, it misses the mark: Obama choices were confirmed for more than half the nation's U.S. attorney slots as of early May. Yet it's not off by much. Obama still doesn't have appointees in place in nearly half the posts. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Thomas Melsheimer	None	None	None	2010-06-10T00:00:00	2010-06-07	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06528	"Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/07/ruben-navarrette-jr/pundit-says-50000-hispanic-citizens-turn-18-and-be/	In an opinion column, California-based pundit Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Republicans risk offending Latino citizens with broadsides about immigrants. "Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote," Navarrette said in his column posted online Sept. 28, 2011, and published in the next day’s Austin American-Statesman. "The GOP had better hope these folks have short memories and don't hold grudges toward those who tried to turn their parents into scapegoats." Setting aside Navarrette’s judgment, we wondered about his figure. By email, the columnist said the 50,000-a-month count was researched by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington group that says it seeks to improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation. Navarrette pointed out a September 2008 news article in the Arizona Republic quoting Mark Hugo Lopez, the center’s associate director, saying: "About 50,000 Latinos a month turn 18 (in the United States) and are eligible to vote for the first time." In an interview, Lopez told us he reached the 50,000 count by dividing by 12 the number of U.S.-born Hispanics recorded as turning 18 in the 2009 American Community Survey undertaken by the U.S. Census Bureau. He forwarded his table indicating that in 2009, 659,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turned 18, or nearly 55,000 a month. From 2000 through 2009, Lopez calculated, an average of 500,500 U.S.-born Hispanics annually turned 18, or nearly 42,000 a month over the 10 years. And what of other population groups? According to the center’s table, some 2.7 million U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites turned 18 in 2009, for a pace of 225,000 a month, and 755,000 U.S.-born non-Hispanic blacks turned 18, nearly 63,000 a month. Compared to Hispanics that year, then, more blacks and four times as many white citizens turned 18 every month. And over the 10 years, the chart indicates, an average of nearly 214,000 whites and nearly 51,000 blacks turned 18 every month. In an interview, Lopez said he put the 50,000-a-month figure in a January 2011 center report on Latinos and congressional reapportionment. The report says that while Hispanics accounted for about 51 percent of the nation’s population growth from 2000 through 2009, not all of that growth translated to immediate electoral strength. To date, Latinos often do not vote in numbers reflecting their share of the population. Then again, the Pew report says, many Latinos are too young to vote or are not U.S. citizens. "Among the nation’s 48.4 million Hispanics in 2009, a record 20.1 million are eligible to vote," the report says. "Yet an even greater number are not eligible to vote. Some 15.5 million Hispanics are U.S. citizens 17 years of age or younger and 12.8 million of all ages are not U.S. citizens. Even so, the number of the Latinos eligible to vote continues to grow. Since 2000, nearly 6 million more Latinos have become eligible to vote. The bulk of this growth was attributable to the 5 million U.S.-born Latino youths nationwide who turned 18 during this past decade. That translates into an additional half-million U.S.-born Latinos coming of age each year — a pattern that is certain to persist, and grow, in the coming decades." The Pew Hispanic Center elaborated on the bulge in U.S.-born Latinos under 18 in an April 2011 report stating that Latino electoral participation reached a national high in 2010, though Latinos still do not turn out in numbers equal to their share of the U.S. population. In 2010, the report says, 16.3 percent of the nation's population was Latino, but only 10.1 percent of eligible voters and fewer than 7 percent of voters were Latino. "This gap is driven by two demographic factors — youth and non-citizenship," the report says. "More than one third of Latinos (34.9 percent) are younger than the voting age of 18. And an additional 22.4 percent are of voting age, but are not U.S. citizens. As a result, the share of the Latino population eligible to vote is smaller than it is among any other group. Just 42.7 percent of the nation's Latino population is eligible to vote, while more than three-in-four (77.7 percent) of whites, two-thirds of blacks (67.2 percent) and more than half of Asians (52.8 percent) are eligible to vote." So, how does Navarrette’s claim stand? The 50,000-a-month count is about right. Regardless, it’s a tad misleading to showcase that figure for Latino Americans when both the number of black and Anglo citizens reaching voting age is, for now, even greater.

pomt-01232	Says Jonathan Gruber was "some adviser who never worked on our staff."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mit-professor-jonathan-gruber-wa/	Even overseas, President Barack Obama couldn’t escape questions about a domestic controversy surrounding the health care law. Footage emerged last week of Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist, claiming more than a year ago that the "stupidity of the American voter" and a "lack of transparency" were key to passing the Affordable Care Act. Why is that of interest? Because Gruber played a role in helping to write and pass the health care law. Obama, however, downplayed Gruber’s involvement while speaking at the G20 summit in Australia. A reporter asked Obama about Gruber’s remarks. Obama replied, "I just heard about this. I get well briefed before I come out here. The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run." Here, we wanted to hash out what role Gruber had in crafting the Affordable Care Act and whether Obama accurately recounted his involvement. Getting to know Gruber Gruber was instrumental in helping Massachusetts build its health care overhaul from 2003 to 2006, sometimes called "Romneycare" after former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, which is widely viewed as the model for the federal law. Both share the central idea to require everyone to purchase health insurance and similarly set up a marketplace to allow individuals to buy coverage. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum claimed a Romney adviser, who turned out to be Gruber, admitted that the Massachusetts law was the model for the federal law. We rated Santorum's claim was Mostly True. We’ve interviewed Gruber from time to time as an expert on both laws. A month after Obama took office in 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services contracted Gruber to provide "technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform," according to a federal job posting. Gruber was the only person considered for the position because he developed a "proprietary statistically sophisticated micro-simulation model that has the flexibility to ascertain the distribution of changes in health care spending and public and private health sector costs." Essentially, Gruber had built a way to accurately estimate health care costs and spending for varying health insurance proposals, federal programs and tax policies, and it made him "uniquely positioned to provide the analytic work." For this, Gruber was paid quite well. According to a recent story by the Washington Post Fact Checker, Gruber earned about $400,000 for his work with HHS and the Obama administration. He has since made seven figures helping various states set up their own insurance marketplaces in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The Gruber Microsimulation Model Gruber’s model, called the Gruber Microsimulation Model, was able to predict important factors, such as how much insurance would cost for individuals to buy in each state. Another important element of Gruber’s model is its outputs were very similar to those produced by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal scorekeeper. With everyone watching closely to see how the Congressional Budget Office was evaluating the fiscal impact of the various health care bills, having a model that could accurately predict what the CBO would say was very valuable to the process. Gruber declined to comment for this story. But others who worked on the legislation have rebutted claims that Gruber was "an architect" of the Affordable Care Act. John McDonough, a Harvard health policy professor who was a senior adviser to the Senate Health and Education Committee when the law was written, told PolitiFact that Gruber’s involvement was important, but it did not involve the actual writing of the bill. "Jon had designed an economic model to be able to estimate any changing set of parameters like how much a policy would cost and how many people would get covered and various other effects," said McDonough, who also worked with Gruber in Massachusetts. "In 2009 and 2010 he took a year off from his teaching and other duties and worked out of his home in Lexington, Mass., and was basically on call almost 24-7 to run various models for us." "But he was not in the room in the determination of what policies would be in or not be in the law," McDonough added. "I was one of an army of people who were in the room at various times. Jon was not." Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress who served as a senior adviser for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services from 2009-10, wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that Gruber "did not make policy, nor did he work for the White House, HHS, or any congressional committee." "The true architects of the ACA are the members of the Senate Finance and Senate Health committees who wrote the bill," she wrote. Gruber and Obama Gruber may not be an architect of the bill, like some have said, but referring to him as "some adviser" is somewhat misleading as well. After all, his microsimulation model made him uniquely qualified for the critical task of figuring out just how much all of this would cost the government and consumers. Such a flippant characterization also dismisses Gruber’s influence on Obama’s positions on health care reform in the lead-up to his presidential bid and during his first year in office. A video clip that resurfaced last week showed then-Sen. Obama speaking at a Brookings Institution event in 2006 (Gruber spoke later in the event). During his remarks, Obama said about the forthcoming Hamilton Project, "You have already drawn some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles, many of them I have stolen ideas from liberally, people ranging from Robert Gordon to Austan Goolsbee; Jon Gruber; my dear friend, Jim Wallis here, who can inform what are sometimes dry policy debates with a prophetic voice." Further, Gruber visited the White House a dozen times from 2009-10, according to visitor logs. This included a July 20, 2009, meeting with Obama. According to a 2011 NBC news story, Obama or his staff sat down a dozen times during 2009 with three different people who helped advise Romney’s health care overhaul in Massachusetts, including Gruber. "The White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts," Gruber told NBC News in 2011. "They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model." Gruber also had meetings with many of the heavyweights on Obama’s economic and health care staff: Peter Orszag, then the director of the Office of Management and Budget; Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council; Jason Furman, the deputy director of the National Economic Council; and Jeanne Lambrew, the director of the Office of Health Reform for the Department of Health and Human Services. Our ruling Obama said Gruber was "some adviser who never worked on our staff." This careful wording significantly downplays the MIT economist's role. Gruber was an adviser. But he was not just "some adviser," an especially flip characterization. By HHS’ own documentation, Gruber was considered "uniquely positioned" for a contract job assisting with Obama’s health care reform efforts. In that sense, he was a very important adviser. Further, while Gruber never worked "on our staff," he was paid by the federal government quite handsomely, and worked very closely with the staff. His economic simulation model was very important to those writing the bill, even if he wasn’t the person deciding what would make the legislation and what would be left at the cutting board. He also met with Obama in the White House and had a dozen meetings that often included some of the most senior members of Obama’s economic and health care teams. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13401	"During her first four years in Washington Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/24/maggie-hassan/hassan-claims-ayote-follows-koch-brothers-agenda-9/	Democrat Maggie Hassan has gone on the attack against Republican rival Kelly Ayotte in the race for U.S. Senate. Recently, Hassan accused Ayotte of siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while representing New Hampshire in the Washington. "During her first four years in Washington, Sen. Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers nearly 90 percent of the time," Hassan said at a recent Democratic unity breakfast. It’s a line straight from one her ads that aired earlier this month. Politifact decided to take a look. The Koch brothers have become well known-names in politics. The men own Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan.-based parent company of several manufacturers and energy companies, like paper maker Georgia-Pacific and refinery Flint Hill Resources. But they have also waded in politics. The brothers’ financial backing helped to found Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that has spent millions backing Republican candidates in New Hampshire and other states. The brothers have never been elected members of Congress, nor have they ever cast a vote on the bills that came before Ayotte, a first-term U.S. senator elected in 2010. But the Koch Brothers know how to let their positions be known. Through a collection of organizations funded with their own money and contributions from donors, they wield massive political influence. Their funding and influence rivals the official Republican Party itself, and their aim is to "fundamentally reshape American public life around a libertarian-infused brand of conservatism," according to Politico. Hassan’s camp pointed us to the flagship of the Koch brothers political network, Americans for Prosperity, and the organization’s scorecard, which ranks lawmakers votes "for economic freedom" each session. AFP favors limited government, low taxes and less regulation. It ranks senators votes according to those stated goals, and picks votes for its scorecard that relate to federal spending, energy, entitlements and taxes, among other issues. Ayotte received a 89 percent score from AFP in the 2011-2012 session after voting for bills "to reduce spending back to 2008 fiscal year levels" and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and against a bill increasing taxes on oil and gas companies, according to the scorecard. Ayotte received a 90 percent score from AFP for the 2013-2014 session. Averaged together, those scores would come to 89.5 percent, or rounded up to 90 percent, which Hassan claims. Hassan’s camp left out Ayotte’s most recent score, from the 2015-2016 session, in which the Republican received a 70 percent rating from AFP. Even so, the scorecard isn’t a vote-by-vote grade. It’s not like AFP tallied the results of 100 votes and agreed with Ayotte 90 percent of the time. The organization scored her and all Senators on a sampling of votes in line with its agenda. Many other votes Ayotte took never registered on the scorecard and could have run afoul of the opinions of either Charles or David Koch. So is it fair to equate the scorecard rank to voting "with the Koch brothers," as Hassan says? AFP’s Luke Hilgemann works with the group’s "federal affairs team," led by AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Brent Gardner and his staff, to pick votes that are included in the scorecard. "No other parties are involved in that process," said spokesman Levi Russell, director of public affairs. "Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard." Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted with the Koch brothers "90 percent of the time" during her first four years in Washington. Ayotte earned a 90 percent rating during those years from an organizations the Koch brothers helped to found, Americans for Prosperity. But, the men don’t vote in the U.S. Senate and the organization said the brothers don’t play a direct role in choosing the votes. Further, Hassan only cited Ayotte’s first four years in office, ignoring her most recent grade. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08658	Russ Feingold "has not worked anywhere outside of politics."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/14/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-ad-says-sen-russ-feingold-has-never-he/	Republican Ron Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, has cast himself as an outsider in his bid for U.S. Senate, branding Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold as a career politician. It’s a common approach for first-time candidates and may play well with voters fed up with Washington. But in a television ad that began airing Sept. 8, 2010, Johnson’s branding iron burned a little hotter. The ad features five unidentified people -- ordinary Wisconsin residents, according to the Johnson campaign -- all tossing a variety of criticisms toward Feingold, including this one: "Russ Feingold is a career politician," a woman says. "Has not worked anywhere outside of politics." Feingold himself has copped to the "career politician" charge, saying at the Milwaukee Press Club in August 2010 he had chosen public service as a career and was proud of it: "I make no apologies for it." But the second half of the statement is a new charge. Is it true, as Johnson claims, Feingold has never had a job outside of politics? Feingold, 57, won election to the state Senate in 1982 at age 29, and served there until 1992, when he was elected to the first of his three terms in the U.S. Senate. That’s 28 years as an elected official and, if you start at age 18, nearly three-quarters of his adult life. But Feingold also was an attorney in Madison from 1979 to 1985, according to his U.S. Senate biography. He worked three years as a lawyer after graduating from Harvard Law School and another three years after being elected to the state Senate. Feingold worked for the firms of Foley & Lardner and La Follette Sinykin, which merged in 2000 with the Milwaukee-based firm Godfrey & Kahn. Seems cut and dried, right? Johnson campaign spokeswoman Sara Sendek acknowledged Feingold worked for the firms but said both "are involved in political work." She went on to say Feingold’s time "as a highly paid lawyer a quarter of a century ago hardly constitutes any sort of real world experience with a business or creating jobs." However, Sendek could not provide any evidence to PolitiFact Wisconsin showing Feingold worked on political items at the firms. We couldn’t find any, either. According to the Feingold campaign, Feingold worked as an attorney on litigation and had business clients, a point supported by attorneys who worked at the two law firms at the time. Neither firm could produce records showing the type of work Feingold did. But retired Foley & Lardner attorney Michael Laskis said Feingold did business litigation. And, according to Rick Bliss, managing partner of Godfrey & Kahn, attorneys from that firm who were at the old LaFollette firm when Feingold was there said Feingold was a trial lawyer. In short, Feingold has spent most of his adult life in politics, and he embraces the idea of being a career politician. But Johnson says Feingold never did anything else -- a point the Feingold disputes to the point of asking the ad be taken down. We rate Johnson’s statement False.

Malia’s court date for this imaginary charge is not Sept. 31. For one thing, she didn’t get arrested. For another, Sept. 31 doesn’t exist. The preposterous claim, published on TheAmericanNews.co, is among the latest of many false news stories about Obama’s two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Recently, we’ve fact-checked claims that Malia was suspended from Harvard and that Sasha was expelled from school. We rated both Pants on Fire. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image that accompanies the false article can be traced to a story we debunked last year. That Pants on Fire post claimed Malia was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting. At the time, Malia was edited into a collection of mugshots from an actual dog-fighting incident in South Carolina in 2013. A cropped version of that altered image appears with the new false claim. We found no evidence of the existence of a "notorious" drug dealer Christopher Turk mentioned in the story. A doctor named Christopher Turk is, however, a main character on the sitcom Scrubs. Malia is currently attending Harvard University, and Sasha is a senior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington.

pomt-10233	"(Palin) supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/moveon/palin-wasnt-in-buchanans-brigade/	Gov. Sarah Palin's conservative credentials have excited the GOP base, and perhaps in equal fashion have ignited the passions of liberals. Palin remained Topic A during the Republican National Convention and her resume has been picked over by friends and foes alike. In the foe category would be MoveOn.org, the liberal activist group, which on Sept. 2 sent an e-mail to an estimated 3.2-million supporters, offering their views of Palin's flaws as a public official. One item caught our attention. The e-mail said Palin, Alaska's governor since 2006, "supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000." "This is information the American people need to see," the email said. "Please take a moment to forward this email to your friends and family." In making its allegation, Move.on picked up on a charge made by others, most notably Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a longtime Barack Obama supporter. The charge relies on a single Associated Press story from July 1999 about Buchanan's campaign stop in tiny Wasilla, Alaska, where Palin was mayor at the time. The article described Palin as "among those sporting Buchanan buttons." We won't delve into the question of whether Buchanan really is a "right-wing extremist." Those are the kinds of judgments voters can make for themselves. But the allegation that Palin was a Buchanan supporter might carry some weight, especially among Jewish voters, many of whom consider him to be anti-Israel. Wexler, in his charge, said Buchanan had "a uniquely atrocious record on Israel," and the Anti-Defamation League calls Buchanan a "racist, anti-Semite." So the question is this: Did Palin support Buchanan in 2000? No. Shortly after Buchanan's visit to Wasilla, and after the AP story, Palin wrote a letter to her local newspaper making clear that her appearance at the Buchanan event wasn't an endorsement of his candidacy. Published July 26, 1999, the letter said: "As mayor of Wasilla, I am proud to welcome all presidential candidates to our city. This is true regardless of their party, or the latest odds of their winning. When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I'll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect. "Though no reporter interviewed me for the Associated Press article on the recent visit by a presidential candidate (Metro, July 17), the article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla. As mayor, I will welcome all the candidates in Wasilla." Not long after, Wasilla endorsed Steve Forbes' unsuccessful bid for the 2000 GOP nomination. The one complication is that Buchanan appeared on CNBC's Hardball on Aug. 30 and claimed that Palin and her husband had been supporters during is '96 campaign. "She was a brigadier for me in '96, as was her husband,'' Buchanan said. "She's a terrific gal. She's a rebel reformer." Buchanan called his supporters the Buchanan Brigades. But on Sept. 3, Buchanan told PolitiFact in St. Paul, Minn., that while he knew Palin attended his rally in Wasilla because of press accounts, he did not know if she actually supported him as a candidate in 2000 or previous campaigns. "I can't confirm anything,'' he said. Campaign finance reports on CQ Moneyline show she never donated money to Buchanan or Forbes. The McCain campaign is emphatic in refuting the charge. "Governor Palin has never supported Pat Buchanan," the McCain campaign said on its "Stop the Smears'' Web site, and called on Wexler to retract his comments. But Wexler spokesman Josh Rogin said that won't happen. "Buchanan says she was a supporter,'' Rogin said. Buchanan doesn't say that anymore. We may never be sure of Palin's position in 1996, but if she says she wasn't a Buchanan supporter and Buchanan says he can't prove that she was, we don't have much to go on. But for our purposes, the question of 2000 is more important because that's what Moveon.org alleges in a widespread e-mail. The letter to the editor that Palin wrote back in 1999 seems pretty clear to us. Even back then she wanted to make it clear that Buchanan wasn't her choice for president in the 2000 race, which leaves us with nowhere to go but False.

pomt-03456	Rhode Island "didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/19/charlene-lima/ri-state-representative-charlene-lima-says-rhode-i/	There was a lot of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives June 13, 2013, about the National Popular Vote bill. Once enough states ratify it -- and nine already have -- Rhode Island would be required to cast its Electoral College votes on behalf of the presidential candidate who, on a national level, gets the highest popular vote, regardless of who wins the presidential contest in Rhode Island. The proposal is designed to discourage candidates from focusing exclusively on battleground states such as Ohio and Florida. One opponent of the plan, which has already received the endorsement of both the House and Senate, was Rep. Charlene Lima, a Cranston Democrat. In her speech on the House floor, carried live on television, she spoke of the "fiercely independent" history of Rhode Island and offered this example: "We didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes. We never ratified that." PolitiFact Rhode Island did a double-take. So we don't have to pay our federal income taxes? Before we wrote to the government to demand a big refund, we called Lima. When we couldn't get through to her right away, we checked some history. It turns out that the 13th Amendment abolished slavery. It had nothing to do with the federal income tax. Rhode Island not only ratified that amendment, we were the second state to do so, on Feb. 2, 1865. The amendment that created the federal income tax was the 16th Amendment. It was ratified by 42 of the 48 states in 1911, 1912 and 1913. (Alaska and Hawaii were not states at the time). Rhode Island rejected it, so Lima is correct about that element of her statement. Then we got to the big question: If Rhode Island didn't ratify it, is Lima correct to say that Rhode Islanders don't have to pay income taxes? No more than Mississippi residents could continue to own slaves after it rejected the 13th Amendment in 1865. (It would take Mississippi another 130 years to formally approve that amendment.) Lima's statement "is wrong in so many different ways," said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. On the issue of paying taxes, the fact that Rhode Island did not ratify the 16th Amendment "does not matter in the least," he said. "Under the Constitution, an amendment becomes part of the Constitution upon the ratification by three-quarters of the states. Under the Supremacy Clause, the U.S. Constitution trumps any contrary state law, which means that states are bound by the Constitution regardless of whether they ratified every part of it. Otherwise, each state would only be bound by the parts of the Constitution that it agrees with, and there would be chaos." So it doesn't look as if we're going to get that refund. When we heard back from Lima, she said she might have named the wrong amendment, she does pay her federal income taxes and "I think people have to pay them." She said her comment was "kinda more tongue in cheek." After her statement on the House floor, she said, the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Helio Melo approached her. "He said, 'I wanted to get up on the floor and say, Don't listen to Rep. Lima,'" Lima said. On this issue, we agree. Rep. Charlene Lima had the wrong amendment and the wrong lesson from history when she said Rhode Island "didn't ratify the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to pay federal income taxes. So Rhode Island doesn't even have to pay federal income taxes." Because her statement falls into the realm of ridiculous, we rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-06321	"Sixty-percent of the state retirees...don’t get Social Security.’’	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/13/kathleen-connell/rhode-island-aarp-head-kathleen-connell-says-60-pe/	Among the more vocal critics of the Chafee administration’s plan to overhaul the state pension system is the head of the Rhode Island chapter of the AARP. Kathleen S. Connell, a former secretary of state and one-time teacher, testified before a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees on Oct. 26 that the plan to suspend annual cost-of-living increases for retirees would be especially onerous for those who don’t collect Social Security. Responding to a question posed by Senate Finance Chairman Daniel DaPonte about how many retirees don’t get Social Security, Connell said: "I believe the figure is on the order of 60 percent of the state retirees -- which are the ones we are addressing -- don’t get Social Security.’’ Her statement prompted some head-shaking in the audience. So we decided to check it out. We contacted the Rhode Island AARP, and John Martin, the group’s spokesman, responded in an e-mail. "This has been called to our attention,’’ Martin wrote. Martin said that while Connell did, indeed, say "state retirees," she actually meant "state teacher retirees [emphasis added] who do not collect Social Security." That’s "around 50 percent," he said. (The figure, he said, is based on data from the state Retirement System and the National Institute on Retirement Security, a nonprofit policy research organization in Washington.) But teachers were never specifically mentioned during the exchange, and we think anyone listening would assume, as we did, that Connell was referring to all retirees in the state-run plans that were being discussed. So we still wanted to know the answer to the Senate chairman’s question: How many state retirees don’t receive Social Security? The facts Social Security, the federal insurance program signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is designed to pay a post-retirement income to workers who contributed to the program. In 1950, Congress expanded Social Security coverage to state and local government employees not covered by other retirement plans; in 1954, the act was amended again to make it available to all state and local employees, except for police officers and firefighters. But state participation was voluntary. Massachusetts, for example, declined coverage for its public employees. Rhode Island opted into the Social Security system for most state workers, but made local participation optional. Participation requires contributions from both employers and employees. Some communities chose not to join. Others did sign on. The result is a patchwork system of coverage. As far as we could tell, no single agency in Rhode Island knows the precise number of retirees in the state system who are covered by Social Security -- not even the state Office of the General Treasurer, according to its spokeswoman, Joy Fox. But we did manage to get a good estimate. Here’s how we did it. The state retirement system comprises five separate pension plans. The largest has 11,421 retired state employees and beneficiaries (generally spouses or children), according to the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island June 30, 2010, actuarial report. All of them, Fox said, are covered by Social Security. The next largest plan covers teachers, with 10,213 retirees and beneficiaries, according to the same actuarial report. Based on the number of active teachers in each school district and the Social Security Agreements filed with the state, the treasurer’s office estimates that about half -- roughly 5,100 retired teachers -- are covered by Social Security. Teachers in 14 of the state’s 37 school districts -- including Providence, Pawtucket, North Providence, Warwick and Woonsocket -- are covered by Social Security, according to the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. Frank Flynn, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, whose members work for 11 of the 15 school districts, agrees with the treasurer’s estimate. After teachers, the next largest group of retirees in the state system -- just under 4,500 -- are local police, firefighters and municipal employees. The Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns reports its survey found that all municipal employees in Rhode Island are covered by Social Security. But that’s not the case with police and firefighters. In fact, several of the state’s larger, urban police and fire departments -- including Providence -- have no Social Security coverage, according to the League’s survey. With the help of one of our newsroom data gurus, we looked at the records of more than 4,000 retired municipal, police and firefighters and their beneficiaries (or 90 percent of that group) in the state system. We found that about 95 percent of them are covered by Social Security. So, all state employees, roughly half of all teachers and 95 percent of retired municipal, police and firefighters in the state retirement system get Social Security. The remaining two groups of retirees in the state system are judges and state police. All of the 81 retired judges and their beneficiaries get Social Security, according to Craig Berke, a spokesman for the state judiciary system. And none of the 266 retired state police are covered by Social Security. Add all the numbers up, and the share of retirees in the state-run plans who do get Social Security is about 78 percent. Even if we added in another 3,000 or so police and firefighters in municipally-run pension plans, almost all of whom don’t get Social Security, the overall percentage of those covered would still be 70 percent. (A week after Connell’s testimony, Mark Dingley, the state’s deputy treasurer, testified before the same committee that the share of current employees in state-run plans is about 75 percent.) The ruling Connell was clearly wrong when she said that 60 percent of "state retirees" don’t get Social Security. Our research found it’s about 22 percent. Connell’s spokesman said she meant retired teachers, not all retirees, although she didn’t make that distinction at the time. Even then, that number is 50 percent, not 60 percent. We rule Connell’s statement False. Correction: The initial version of this item reported that teachers in the City of Central Falls, R.I., were covered by Social Security. That was based on information from the Rhode Island Association of School Committees. After this item was published, the association said that it had made a mistake. In fact, Central Falls teachers are not covered by Social Security. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-06061	"My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-hes-adding-1-billion-new-education/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott asked the Legislature to send more money to education during his State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012 -- and he said he’s not kidding. "My recommended budget includes $1 billion in new state funding for education," Scott said. "And I ask you to please consider that recommendation very carefully. On this point, I just cannot budge. … This is the single most important decision we can make today for Florida’s future." But the $1 billion isn’t purely "new" additional funding as Scott said. About $190 million is needed to pay for 30,000 more students expected for next year, and another $220 million goes to make up for a 3 percent drop in property values. Another problem with Scott’s claim to support "new" education funding: It doesn’t make up for budget cuts that Scott signed into law just last year. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by Democrats in state government. Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, called Scott’s fervor for education funding "new-found." "The bottom line is that we would still be funding education at a level hundreds of millions of dollars less than we did in 2007 if the governor’s proposal is passed. It won’t make up for the $1.35 billion that the Legislature cut from K-12 education last session," Rich said in a newsletter to constituents in December. We went looking for budget documents and news reports on the matter, and we soon confirmed last year’s education cuts. We even found evidence of the decline in Scott’s own budget documents on his Let’s Get to Work website. (See page 33 of this chart.) Scott’s data shows a few interesting trends. Starting with fiscal year 2003, total education funding climbed every year, reaching $18.75 billion in 2007. It then dipped to $17.92 billion in 2008, before climbing again to $18 billion in 2009 and $18.22 billion in 2010, thanks largely to federal economic stimulus funds. In 2011, funding dropped to $16.58 billion, according to interim calculations. Scott’s proposal to add state funds would push total funding to $17.15 billion in 2012. As Rich noted, that’s still below pre-recession levels. Scott is right that he wants to add roughly $1 billion in funding for schools this year, but we think it’s disingenuous to call that money "new" -- a descriptor that gives people a distinct impression that education funding is up. Some of that $1 billion in funding is to pay for new students and to close a gap created by lost funding from declining property values. And it doesn’t quite make up for the deeper cuts Scott signed off on a year ago. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-01-10T15:54:14	2012-01-10	['None']
pomt-04896	"Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/06/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-gun-violence-claimed-more-am/	War may be good for one thing: providing U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg with leverage for his argument that the United States needs stricter gun laws. Lautenberg, who is pushing to reinstate a federal ban on high-capacity ammunition clips in the wake of the deadly mass shooting last month at a Colorado movie theater, said, "our lax gun laws make it far too easy for murderers to commit acts of violence." "Here are the facts: Guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the two wars, more than 6,500 American soldiers have lost their lives. During the same period, however, guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil," Lautenberg said in a July 30 op-ed article posted on NorthJersey.com. Lautenberg’s numbers are technically correct since 2001. In fact, he could have cited just a year of gun violence in the U.S. to make his point. But experts call his comparison flawed and misleading. "More pickles are consumed in New York City than in Rhode Island. Is that a good comparison? I don’t think so. Because there are way more people in New York City," said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the school of criminal justice at The University at Albany. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks murders in the United States through its Uniform Crime Report program. Caley Gray, a spokesman for Lautenberg, cited that source -- which shows more than 8,700 people were murdered in the United States with firearms in 2010 -- to support the senator’s statement. Since 2001 -- the year the war in Afghanistan began -- more than 95,000 people have been murdered with a gun in the United States, according to the FBI data. Though those statistics do not include citizenship status, Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said "my reaction is that you can safely assume that the vast majority of murder victims are U.S. citizens." That death toll is far higher than the number of U.S. military casualties from the nation’s recent wars. More than 6,500 U.S. military personnel have died in conflicts from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, according to data from the U.S. Department of Defense. Gray said: "The numbers speak for themselves. The bottom line and the sad truth is that far more Americans are being killed by guns in their own neighborhoods than in deadly war zones." But Kleck called the senator’s comparison "foolish and misleading." "Taking account of the very different population sizes at risk, the risk of a gun homicide (or any kind of homicide) is enormously greater in Afghanistan than in the U.S.," Kleck said in an e-mail. "Obviously even one homicide is one too many, but the hinted suggestion that the risk of death from a gun is even remotely as high in the U.S. as in Afghanistan is absurd." Lizotte also criticized Lautenberg’s statement for focusing only on the deaths of U.S. troops. "Many more people were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq than Americans," he said. For example, a July 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service noted that in Afghanistan "11,864 civilians have been killed in the conflict since 2007, when the United Nations began reporting statistics, to the end of 2011." Our ruling Lautenberg said, "guns have murdered more Americans here at home in recent years than have died on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan," claiming that "more than 6,500 American soldiers" died while "guns have been used to murder about 100,000 people on American soil." Though Lautenberg’s numbers are mainly on target, three experts agreed that the senator’s statement is flawed largely because he uses raw numbers to compare two very different populations. Also, Lautenberg focuses solely on deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, when many more have died in both wars. We rate this statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12745	"The primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/thomas-perez/taxes-wealthy-pay-obamacare-dncs-perez-overshoots/	The morning after President Donald Trump promised to "repeal and replace Obamacare," Democratic party chief Tom Perez took a dig at Republicans for ignoring the good that the health care law does. "It's a lifesaver," Perez said. "If they had come in good faith during the Obama administration, we would have been more than open to fixing it. But that's not what they're about. They want it repealed. And here is why: the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act so that you can provide a big giveaway to the wealthy." Perez was focused on the GOP’s political motives, but our focus is on his assertion that taxing the wealthy is the primary means of paying for the Affordable Care Act. Perez is correct that tax hikes on individuals making over $200,000 per year and couples making over $250,000 are the largest single source of revenues under the law. But that ignores a larger piece of the financial picture: the spending reductions in Medicare. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the impartial analytic arm of Congress, savings from Medicare are projected to provide about $228 billion to offset the costs of the sweeping health care law. The tax on higher-income households delivers about $136 billion, between 2016 and 2020. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the CBO and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, took issue with Perez’s summary. "I would say that the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act was Medicare changes," Buntin told us. Under the law, Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors, is slated to grow more slowly than it otherwise would. It largely does that by limiting payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Over time, those limits add up. Joe Antos, a health care analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think tank, cautioned that there’s a lot of guess work in counting those dollars. "In terms of financing it's not just the revenue you collect, but it’s the reduction in other spending to offset your expansion in other areas," Antos said. The Medicare savings, for example, helped pay for the expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program to help the working poor. Marc Goldwein at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget put taxes on wealthier Americans into the context of the many pieces that go into the total package that is the Affordable Care Act. On top of the dollars from Medicare and taxes on the well-to-do, there are taxes on drug and medical equipment makers. "Taxes on high-earners cover one-fifth or maybe one-quarter of the ACA’s costs," Goldwein said. "That’s large, but I wouldn’t call it the primary financing mechanism." Antos said that Republicans seem to be fine with the trims in Medicare spending. "You can’t find anybody who says they want to get rid of those Medicare cuts," Antos said. "If Republicans were to eliminate those, they would have to go elsewhere to find those billions of dollars. In health care, there is no other place to go." If the Medicare spending trajectory is off the table, then the next big item would be the taxes on higher-income earners. We reached out to Perez’s office and did not hear back. Our ruling Perez said that "the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people." According to CBO estimates, those taxes are the largest single revenue source, but trims in future Medicare spending growth do much more to keep the Affordable Care Act in balance. Every analyst we reached said that the complete fiscal package includes both revenues and spending cuts and it is misleading to say that the taxes are the main means of financing the health care program. Perez gave only half the picture. Accordingly, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf215582-c926-4ae5-bf2c-1de106558d6f	None	Thomas Perez	None	None	None	2017-03-01T17:26:38	2017-03-01	['None']
pomt-05619	Says under the new health care law "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/26/joseph-kyrillos/senate-hopeful-claims-obama-administrations-health/	For Joe Kyrillos, it’s clear "we must repeal ObamaCare." In a campaign e-mail, the Republican state senator and U.S. Senate hopeful made his case for taking the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, ObamaCare -- off the books. "The fears are unanimous. ObamaCare is too expensive. It is a government takeover of our healthcare system. Services will be diminished. The patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated. It will not make healthcare more affordable. And it will bankrupt small businesses," Kyrillos said in the March 15 e-mail. There’s a slew of claims in that paragraph, including PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year about the government takeover of health care, but one jumped out at us: "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." To support the claim, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, first pointed to a survey of physicians that found more than half of the roughly 5,000 doctors who responded said health care reform would have a negative impact on their relationship with patients. But that doesn’t prove the relationship will be eliminated and a spokesman for the company that conducted the survey said Kyrillos’ statement is "a step further than what our survey would say." When asked for specifics from the law, Fay pointed to the "value-based payment modifier under the physician fee schedule." The modifier provides financial penalties or rewards to doctors serving Medicare patients depending on the quality and cost of the care delivered. In another e-mail he said: "To the extent that Medicare drives all health care services, one could make the argument that the relationship as we once knew it will be 'eliminated.’ Primarily due to two new federal bureaucracies - IPAB and Preventive Services Task Force." The 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding targets. The board can’t recommend changes that would ration care or raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, among other measures. It will be able to decrease government payments to health care providers and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes recommendations on clinical preventive services to primary care clinicians. Under the new law, certain plans must cover recommendations made by the task force. Some experts expressed concerns about how such measures will influence the doctor-patient relationship, but it’s clear that relationship isn’t eliminated. Whether treatments are covered by insurance or result in out-of-pocket costs is another matter -- and not a new one. Robert Moffit, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the traditional doctor-patient relationship, if defined as a doctor recommends treatment and insurance pays for it, has been deteriorating. Moffit said the health care law "does change the practice of medicine," significantly, but he called Kyrillos’ language "a little too strong." Other experts said Kyrillos’ claim overreaches. "As I read the legislation these are all tools to strengthen the primary care infrastructure so that it can better support patient-physician relationships," said Ann O’Malley, a senior health researcher for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group cited by both Republicans and Democrats. O’Malley also said Kyrillos’ statement assumes the "existing system is set up so it’s in the best interest of patients, and it’s not." Judy Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who served in the federal health department under President Bill Clinton, said the measures Kyrillos highlighted "define some of the coverage and payment features but they are not in any way dictating the relationship between the patient and a doctor." Kyrillos’ campaign was not swayed. "The fact is that this law eliminates the ‘doctor-patient’ relationship and creates the ‘doctor-patient-government’ relationship," Fay said. Our ruling Under the Obama administration’s health care law, Kyrillos claimed "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." That’s a hefty charge. And there’s little proof to substantiate it. Provisions in the health care law allow changes to payments to health care providers and influence what’s covered by certain insurance plans, but nothing in the bill prevents physicians and patients from making health care decisions together. Kyrillos may need to call a doctor after this ruling: Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-03-26T07:30:00	2012-03-15	['None']
