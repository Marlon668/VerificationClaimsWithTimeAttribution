pomt-15019	Birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger "believed that people like me should be eliminated."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/oct/05/ben-carson/did-margaret-sanger-believe-african-americans-shou/	Despite being dead for 49 years, Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, has a way of turning up in the news. Her latest appearance came during remarks by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a retirement center in Exeter, N.H. Answering a question at RiverWoods Retirement Community, Carson said that "Planned Parenthood, as you know, was founded by Margaret Sanger. . . . Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist. She believed that people like me should be eliminated, or kept under control." At a press conference later, he specified what he meant by "people like me." He said he was "talking about the black race." Claims like this have been examined by PolitiFact before. Back in March, New Hampshire Rep. William O’Brien claimed Sanger was an "an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan." That claim was rated false. And in 2011, businessman and GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain said Planned Parenthood’s early mission was to "help kill black babies before they came into the world." That statement was rated Pants on Fire. Carson’s statement pulls on the same threads. Sanger was indeed a believer in eugenics, but the basic concept that humanity could be improved by selective breeding was an article of faith for many in the years before World War II. Winston Churchill, Herbert Hoover, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells all supported the movement. African-American leader W. E. B. Du Bois backed many of its principles as well. Although the eugenics movement included some who had racist ideas, wanting to create some sort of master race, "only a minority of eugenicists" ever believed this, according to Ruth Engs, professor emerita at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the movement. At the time that Sanger was active, Engs wrote, "the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking." It’s a far cry to equate eugenics with advocating the elimination of black people. For Sanger, her ideas were a matter a public health. As late as 1957, she put her views this way in an interview with Mike Wallace: "I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit." Sanger was indeed a birth control activist, which means that she wanted women to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She worked for women of all classes and races to have that choice, which she believed to be a right. Quoted in an article about the false accusation that Sanger supported the Ku Klux Klan (she merely addressed a women’s auxiliary and later compared them to children because of their mental simplicity), Jean H. Baker, author of Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion, said Sanger actually opposed prejudice. Sanger "was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation," wrote Baker, a history professor at Goucher College, in an email. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere." Even authors who treat Sanger critically don’t believe she held negative views about African-Americans. Edwin Black wrote a comprehensive history of the eugenics movement, War Against the Weak, and is no fan of the activist’s beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, "Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic." It’s also worth noting that Sanger died in 1966, six years before the Supreme Court established a nationwide right to abortion services in Roe v. Wade. Those who point a finger at Sanger as a racist often cite a particular statement in claiming she harbored ill will toward black people. In a Dec. 10, 1939, letter, she wrote that "We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs." But PolitFact Georgia debunked those who would read the statement as something sinister. "Sanger’s correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears," the article says. She attracted an impressive roster of supporters, including DuBois; Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of National Council of Negro Women; and the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Eleanor Roosevelt also backed the effort. "For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft," the PolitiFact piece notes. Finally, in 1966 Planned Parenthood gave its Margaret Sanger award to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader accepted, and sent his wife, Coretta, to accept. The speech he wrote for the occasion stated that ""There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts." Sanger was still alive at that point, and her history and statements were well known (she had published an autobiography in 1938 and was never shy about sharing her opinions). If she had, in fact, been a supporter of eliminating black people, it’s doubtful King would have accepted that award. Our ruling Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said that birth control activist Margaret Sanger "believed that people like me should be eliminated." He later clarified that he meant African-Americans. While Sanger indeed supported the eugenics movement, substantial evidence shows that she was not racist and in fact worked closely with black leaders and health care professionals. Carson’s statement bears no relation to historical reality. We rate the claim False. Correction, October 6, 2015, 12:30 p.m.: This article has been changed to attribute two comments to Ruth Engs, professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health, that had incorrectly been attributed to another researcher.

pomt-12663	"There's no demonstrable evidence they (after-school programs that feed kids) are helping kids do better at school."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/21/mick-mulvaney/wh-budget-chief-wrongly-claims-afterschool-program/	White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney triggered a storm of complaints when he defended elimination of a large federal after-school program. When asked in a press conference about the impact on students in Pennsylvania, Mulvaney couched his answer as pertaining to "after-school programs generally." "They're supposed to be educational programs, right," he said March 16. "That's what they're supposed to do, they're supposed to help kids who can't -- who don't get fed at home, get fed so that they do better at school. Guess what? There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually doing that. There's no demonstrable evidence they're actually helping results, helping kids do better at school." President Donald Trump’s budget zeros out the $1.2 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program that helps fund after-school and summer programs in disadvantaged communities around the country. We wondered what the research shows. Is there evidence programs like this help academically? The answer is a qualified yes. Improvements in test scores can be modest, and results vary from place to place. Also, as you might expect, the kids who actually come every day do better than those who don’t. California commissioned the UCLA Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing to do a detailed analysis of that state’s program. The center’s 2012 report found that among high school students "participation had a slightly positive but minor effect on English language arts and math California Standards Test scores." How minor? Students who took advantage of the afterschool program on average had scores a few points higher than a control group (matched according to a number of characteristics). Researchers called the results statistically significant but "substantively weak." For younger children, from kindergarten through eighth grade, the center’s research found the program boosted test scores only for the students who came regularly. For those who rarely showed up, there was no benefit. Deborah La Torre, a research associate at the UCLA center, told us food is an incidental part of these programs, and she called Mulvaney’s description "muddled." In California, the kids must get a "healthy snack." "None of the programs just provide food," La Torre said. "That’s not what they are about. They are mandated to provide specific academic programs in math and English, to help with homework and offer other programs such as art or physical fitness." The Texas Education Agency also brought in an outside group to assess its federally funded afterschool program. Similarly to the California study, researchers found "program participation was associated with higher Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills scores in reading/English language arts and mathematics." But the benefits in Texas also mirrored California in that they were "primarily in the small to moderate range." Mulvaney’s focus on food puzzled other experts in this field, including Ken Springer at Southern Methodist University’s School of Education. "Mr. Mulvaney's phrase ‘doing better in school’ leads somewhat narrowly to the question of whether better nutrition fosters better grades and test scores," Springer told us. "It does, but when we focus specifically on better nutrition provided by afterschool programs, there's evidence that these programs can have other benefits, such as positively impacting students' knowledge about nutrition as well as their eating habits." Springer said, and we confirmed, that there are many studies that affirm the educational benefits of feeding children from low-income families breakfast and lunch. Education researchers also emphasize that test scores alone are not the only measure of impact. Reduced absenteeism and better odds of moving up to the next grade are also linked to afterschool programs. We made several requests for information from the White House and the Office of Management and Budget. We did not hear back. Our ruling Mulvaney said that there is no evidence that federally funded afterschool programs that feed students help kids do better in school. Two studies from two of the largest states, California and Texas, found modest but positive impacts on test scores. They also found other gains, such as better attendance at school and better odds of moving up to the next grade. Mulvaney made a strong assertion that there is no evidence of gains. There is, even if test scores only rise a little bit. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mick Mulvaney	None	None	None	2017-03-21T10:17:55	2017-03-16	['None']
pomt-14640	"Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/26/virginia-center-public-safety/gun-control-group-says-more-americans-have-died-fi/	During a recent rally at Capitol Square in Richmond, gun control advocates handed out fliers with a grisly statistic. "Since John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, more Americans have died by gunfire within our own country than American servicemen and women who were killed in all our wars," says the brochure, distributed on Jan. 18 by the Virginia Center for Public Safety. The claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it’s been vetted by our colleagues in the national office twice over the years. We decided to take a new look through the lens of the latest available data. War casualties The most comprehensive list we found on U.S. war dead was compiled in January 2015 by the Congressional Research Service. It included casualties from the Revolutionary War through Operation Inherent Resolve, which is targeting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria. The number of U.S. dead in all those conflicts comes to nearly 1.2 million, according to the research service. We should add a qualifier here: The research service says that during the Civil War, the nation’s deadliest conflict, Union and Confederate losses combined were 525,000 to 530,000. But a 2012 study by a Binghamton University historian estimated the combined toll was much higher -- about 750,000. If we use that higher Civil War figure, it would bring the total U.S. deaths in military conflicts to about 1.4 million. Gun deaths The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a series of hard figures and estimates of yearly gunfire deaths in the U.S. from 1968 to 2014. They add up to about 1.5 million fatalities. The Virginia Center for Public Safety’s claim on gun deaths goes back a little bit further, to 1963. We couldn’t find figures going back to that year, since the oldest year for which data were available was 1968. A CDC chart shows 24,000 gun deaths occurred that year. With that in mind, the figure of 1.5 million deaths since November 1963 surely is an underestimate of the level of gun violence since then, because it excludes four years. The actual number probably is close to 1.6 million. A key thing to know about these figures: They include not just murders but all gun deaths. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun deaths were suicides; 33 percent were homicides; and the rest were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes. Our ruling The Virginia Center for Public Safety says that since 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire than have been killed in all U.S. wars. Figures going back to 1968 show about 1.5 million firearms deaths have occurred since then. That doesn’t include data from gun deaths from 1963 to 1967, years for which figures aren’t available, so this is a conservative estimate on firearms deaths since Kennedy was assassinated. In contrast, a high-side figure for U.S. war deaths shows that about 1.4 million service members have been killed in conflicts. So we rate the claim True.

pomt-01459	The state-hired company that evaluates state-mandated student exams "goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/02/leticia-van-de-putte/van-de-putte-critical-high-stakes-exam-says-testin/	In a debate at Austin's KLRU-TV, Channel 18, Democrat Leticia Van de Putte, her party’s nominee for lieutenant governor, revisited her declared desire to battle the "high stakes" state-mandated exams imposed by law before students qualify to graduate from high school. But the San Antonio state senator caught our ear in the Sept. 29, 2014, faceoff with Republican nominee Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, by indicating the company that manages the tests in Texas has some possibly cheapskate habits. After saying students in the top-notch Highland Park school district in Dallas had struggled on the state-imposed English II exam, Van de Putte added: "Probably because our testing company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays." We wondered if the scorer posts get filled starting from free ads placed on Craigslist, the mostly free online classified ad service founded in 1995. In January 2013, a couple of news reports said Pearson, the company hired by the Texas Education Agency to administer the state tests, had been using Craigslist to advertise openings. According to a Jan. 16, 2013, blog post by the Answer Sheet newsletter on The Washington Post’s website, and pointed out to us by Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia, Pearson ran an ad on Craigslist Nov. 29, 2012, looking for people to hire and train to score the written portion of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills; that was then the name of the state exams. "According to a press release released by leaders of a coalition of people in Texas seeking to reform standardized testing in the state," Answer Sheet said, "the ad says college graduates would be paid $12 an hour for doing the job. According to the Craigslist ad, ‘Bachelor degree required – any field welcome,’" Answer Sheet said, adding that the coalition was urging legislators and the TEA to find a way to ensure only English teachers graded student essays in the exams. A few days later, KDFW-TV, Channel 4 in Dallas, aired a news report saying Pearson Testing "uses Craigslist to solicit people to grade" the state test, which had been revised and renamed the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. This story included a statement from the TEA stating the agency was "fully aware that the Pearson Testing company utilizes multiple employment avenues to secure and adequately train qualified candidates. Pearson carefully trains the graders, and experienced supervisors oversee the work to ensure that essays are graded in a fair and consistent manner." On its website, KDFW included information attributed to Pearson stating Pearson exhaustively searches for the best people to score student tests relying on the same employment resources school districts use to promote career opportunities. Pearson said its search for scorers in Texas extended to ads with 21 organizations and publications including the National Council of Teachers of English, the Austin American-Statesman and the Texas Workforce Commission--as well as Craigslist, ClassifiedAds.com and the Austin Chronicle among venues, Pearson said. "All test scorers hired by Pearson must have at least a four-year degree and undergo very rigorous, state-approved training before they are allowed to begin work," Pearson said, according to KDFW. "As part of this rigorous training, applicants must complete and pass practice sets before being eligible to work. The rigorous training program for scorers was developed with the Texas Education Agency, and TEA must approve all final training materials." We double-checked this additional information, confirming from Pearson that the company posts ads on Craigslist and numerous other outlets. By email, Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, provided Pearson’s 2013 statement on the Craigslist criticism. She also guided us to Dave Clark, a Texas-based Pearson official, who said by phone Craigslist is among 21 advertising venues used by Pearson when it’s hunting for qualified test scorers. Clark said: "We have to blanket the entire state to find scorers; it’s seasonal work." Asked if using Craigslist leaves the impression that the recruitment of scorers is slapdash, Clark replied that if so, people would have to reach a similar illogical characterization of the other places where Pearson advertises such jobs. To our inquiry, Brandon Pinette, a Washington, D.C.-based Pearson spokesman, emailed a statement similar to the one circulated in 2013. Among recent applicants to grade the Texas exams, Pinette advised, 11 percent fulfilled Pearson’s requirements. Among the successful applicants, he said, 71 percent had at least a year of classroom teaching experience, 83 percent had writing-intensive four-year college degrees and 27 percent had a degree in English. Our ruling Van de Putte, who has said she opposes high-stakes state-imposed student testing, said the company that scores the existing state tests "goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays." There’s a strand of truth here; scorer positions have been advertised on Craigslist. But this statement leaves a loosey-goosey impression by not acknowledging the testing company spreads the word about its scorer jobs in a wide range of venues. Also unnoted, the company further screens applicants to ensure they’re up to the job. Such information was public nearly two years ago. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-11698	"The truth is this tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/dec/22/kirsten-gillibrand/will-republican-tax-law-raise-middle-class-taxes/	Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand claims the major tax overhaul passed by Congress this week will increase tax bills for middle-class earners in New York state. Gillibrand, in Buffalo on Dec 15, said filers who pay state and local taxes in New York state will be hit particularly hard by the legislation. "I'm concerned, obviously, about this tax bill because it's going to raise taxes on the middle class," Gillibrand said. "The truth is this tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes. For all New Yorkers who pay local and state taxes, it’s going to be very difficult, because they’re going to have to pay a lot more money." Gillibrand made the claim before Republicans released their final tax bill, a compromise between versions passed in the House and Senate. We’re basing our fact check on details that were available at the time. Was she right that middle-class earners will see higher taxes under the Republican plan? Other tax benefits Research groups across the political spectrum agree that the middle class will benefit from provisions in the tax law -- at least at first. The standard deduction will double to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers. That change was also in the Senate bill. More filers will come out ahead using the standard deduction instead of itemizing state and local taxes. A majority of middle-income filers already take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. About 44 percent of those making between $50,000 and $75,000 deduct state and local taxes in New York state according to the Tax Policy Center. Even in states like New York, where a third of taxpayers deduct their state and local taxes from their federal tax, the new limits on those deductions are not likely to result in higher overall tax bills. Tax rates for middle-income earners will go down. Those making between about $38,000 and $70,000 will see their federal tax rate decrease from 25 percent to 22 percent, for example. Middle-income filers will also benefit from a provision to double the child tax credit to $2,000. For those who owe little or no taxes, up to $1,400 of that credit is refundable. "The good news for taxpayers is that every income group would pay less in taxes in 2019," according to a PolitiFact analysis. The analysis was based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan group that analyzes tax bills for Congress, and the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. Down the road The Joint Committee on Taxation predicted that taxpayers making $40,000 and up would see a tax cut immediately until 2025 under the law. In 2019, filers at every income level will see a tax cut. The average person making $45,000 would see the amount of their income spent on federal taxes decrease from 10.9 percent to 9.9 percent, according to the committee's report. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tax benefit shifts after 2025 when most changes for individual filers expire, including the lower tax brackets and cap on state and local tax deductions. After the individual provisions expire, all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. "Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027," according to the PolitiFact analysis. "That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average." Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Gillibrand said the Republican "tax [plan] raises middle-class taxes." That's not true during the first years of the new tax provisions. If not for the sunset for the tax changes for individuals, we likely would have rated Gillibrand's statement False or perhaps Mostly False. Middle-income taxpayers will either benefit or see no change in their tax liability through 2025. But her claim could hold up after the bill's individual provisions expire that year. There's no guarantee a future Congress will extend those parts of the bill. So for that reason, her statement is partially true but still ignores important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10720	"People were hopeless. Sixty percent of the population, 70 percent of the population wanted to live somewhere else. . . . By the time I left, 70 percent wanted to stay."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/21/rudy-giuliani/the-frown-was-already-turning-upside-down/	New Yorkers weren't happy just before Rudy Giuliani took office, but it wasn't as dire as he says. That 60 or 70 percent figure he mentions was two-year-old news by the time he took office. In November 1991, the New York Times / WCBS-TV News conducted a poll among New Yorkers in which 60 percent said things had gotten so bad in the city they would leave tomorrow, if they could. But that startling figure, which Giuliani uses, had changed by the time he prepared to take office. Just before Giuliani defeated incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, the Times and WCBS did the poll again. Between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, 1993, they asked 1,223 adults some questions about New York City. The responses were generally pessimistic; the Times referred to them as "grim." Nearly two-thirds viewed the economy as bad or very bad, almost as many thought crime had gotten worse, and so on. Here was the New York Times description of the "want to leave" issue: "In its most provocative finding, the survey determined that 45 percent of respondents said things had got so bad in New York that they would move out tomorrow if they could. Some pollsters played down the significance of the finding, noting that similar surveys in Chicago and London also showed many residents said they wanted to leave immediately." That 45 percent may be disturbing, but it's not 60 or 70 percent, as Giuliani said. In fact, despite the "grim" findings about New Yorker attitudes, the percentage who wanted to leave had been dropping sharply in the two years before Giuliani took office. From 60 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1993. It fell to about 33 percent in eight years under Giuliani. As for 70 percent wanting to stay, the Giuliani campaign cites a New York Times /CBS News poll in August 2001, just before the 9/11 attacks and in the midst of a campaign to elect a successor to Giuliani. The New York Times reported that "barely a third" of the respondents said they would move out of the city if they could and added that "about 60 percent" of New Yorkers wanted to stay in New York. It should be noted that the question had a couple of important predicates, including a longer-term time horizon: "Looking ahead about four years, if it was entirely up to you, would you want to be living where you are now, or would you want to be living somewhere else in New York City, or outside the city." A variation on earlier surveys limited the choice to NYC or "somewhere else," but the negative results varied only a little when both versions of the question were used. So the "city that I was handed" at the end of 1993 did not have 60 or 70 percent who wanted to leave, but only 45 percent, according to the polls, and the city Giuliani managed for nearly eight years had 60 percent who wanted to stay, according to the poll he cites, not 70 percent. There's no disagreement among sources here. Giuliani just misquotes the numbers, and does so in a way that reflects better on him. We find his statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11426	"Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/16/andrew-cuomo/half-female-homicides-us-involve-intimate-partner/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants state lawmakers to pass a bill he believes would prevent more women from being murdered by people close to them. The bill would remove guns from people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Guns are currently only taken away if someone has a felony conviction for domestic violence. "Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners," Cuomo said at a March 13 rally. The bill is part of Cuomo’s 2018 Women’s Agenda, a list of more than two dozen proposals concerning healthcare, equal pay and gun violence among other issues. The domestic violence bill doubles as one of the governor’s proposals to add to the state’s gun control laws. New York state already has one of the lowest rates of gun-caused death in the country, but Cuomo believes the proposal could drive that number lower. Is he right that half of women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners? The data Cuomo’s claim comes from data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017. The agency looked at the homicides of 10,018 adult women in 18 states from 2003 to 2014. The circumstances of the homicide were known in 8,028 of the cases. Of those, 4,442 homicides, or 55.3 percent, were related to intimate partner violence. The report defines an intimate partner as a current, former, or unspecified spouse or romantic partner. Women killed while intervening in an incident of intimate partner violence, like a friend or family member, were also counted in this category. Almost 80 percent of intimate partner homicides involved a current intimate partner. About 11 percent of victims had experienced violence in the month preceding their death. An argument preceded the victim’s death in about a third of intimate partner homicides, the report found. Gun-involved homicides The report does not include data on the criminal history of the suspects. It’s not known what share had a history of domestic violence. But the agency did collect information on the type of weapon used in each homicide. A firearm was used in 5,234 of the total homicides, or almost 54 percent. That’s more than double the number of victims killed with a sharp instrument, the next most-documented weapon. The authors of the report suggest legislation like Cuomo’s could help prevent more female homicides in the future. "State statutes limiting access to firearms for persons under a domestic violence restraining order can serve as another preventive measure associated with reduced risk for intimate partner homicide and firearm intimate partner homicide," the report said. A report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found an estimated 45 percent of female homicide victims were killed by an intimate partner in 2007. New York state data Numbers in New York state mirror national data. About 48 percent of female domestic homicides in New York state involved an intimate partner in 2016, according to a report from the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. A firearm was used in about a third of all domestic homicides in New York state. The state data does not include homicides where there was no known relationship between the suspect and victim. Our ruling Cuomo said "Half of the American women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partners." Data collected by the CDC supports Cuomo’s claim. More than half of the female homicides the agency studied involved an intimate partner when the relationship was known. We rate his claim True.

pomt-06073	The EPA was asked about an environmental citation for the city landfill in Nashua, N.H. but "didn’t know" why it was cited.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-epa-didnt-know-why-it-cited-new/	Excessive government regulation commanded a good portion of the NBC News-Facebook GOP debate on Meet the Press on the morning of Jan. 8, 2012. During the debate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich was asked about his idea to replace the Environmental Protection Agency. Gingrich was quick to criticize the government agency designed to "protect human health and the environment." "If you look at the EPA's record, it is increasingly radical," Gingrich said. "It's increasingly imperious. It doesn't cooperate, it doesn't collaborate, and it doesn't take into account economics. The city of Nashua recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly, ‘We don't know. We can't find the records that lead to this citation, and we're not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn't have sent it out.’" We wondered whether Gingrich’s vague classification of an EPA citation really went down that way. First we contacted Gingrich’s campaign to find out how the speaker came up with this example, but they never got back to us. We turned to Nashua Telegraph reporter Albert McKeon, who did a story on the city’s EPA problem last month, to see if Gingrich explained the situation accurately. As far as "a citation" goes, McKeon said Gingrich framed that explanation incorrectly. EPA didn't give the dump a citation. Rather it put it on a list, McKeon said. "The description for the list itself is very vague. It says it doesn’t imply any organization has committed any violation, it just triggered them to be on a list of being watched." McKeon reported that Four Hills Landfill in Nashua had appeared on three months’ worth of the EPA’s watch lists for supposed violators of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Resource Conservation and Recovery (for hazardous waste) acts. The purpose of the watch list, however, seemed a little fuzzy. According to the EPA Web site, the watch list exists "to facilitate dialogue between EPA, state and local environmental agencies on enforcement matters relating to facilities with alleged violations identified as either significant or high priority." Being on the watch list does not mean a facility has violated the law, according to the agency, but only that an EPA investigation, or a state or local environmental study, has led an organization to assert an unproven violation has occurred. "Being on the watch list does not represent a higher level of concern regarding the alleged violations that were detected, but instead indicates cases requiring additional dialogue between EPA, state and local agencies -- primarily because of the length of time the alleged violation has gone unaddressed or unresolved," the EPA site says. The reason Nashua’s dump made the list also was vague, McKeon said. EPA spokesman Dave Deegan, working at the agency’s Boston offices, told McKeon a "data lag" on the watch list, which cited a long-ago state Department of Environmental Services action against the Nashua landfill, got Four Hills on the list. But Four Hills had had no violations in recent memory and was in compliance with environmental standards, Deegan said. "Nashua had no idea they were on the list, and the EPA, quite frankly, didn’t either," McKeon said. "(Deegan) said it was a violation in the past. He said they were not really sure what it was, but somehow it got transferred to the EPA's database, and it shouldn’t be on there because there were no problems with Nashua." Nashua being on the list was more a matter of not keeping records up-to-date. Nashua is not currently under any scrutiny for any violations, according to the city and the EPA. Our ruling: Gingrich said the EPA cited a Nashua landfill without knowing its reason for doing so. The landfill made a "watch list" for an outdated action, but it was not cited or fined for any violation by the EPA for being on the list. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14954	Some 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people "in this country illegally are working."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/23/ron-johnson/two-thirds-people-country-illegally-are-working-go/	Like many conservatives, U.S. Ron Johnson has repeatedly called for the United States to secure its borders. But in making that call again Oct. 7, 2015, the Wisconsin Republican also seemed to defend most of the estimated 11 million residents who are living in the country illegally. Johnson was interviewed on a conservative talk show on KTLK-AM in Minnesota's Twin Cities. The topic was a hearing he would lead the next day as chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Asked by a listener if it's possible to secure the border and "negotiate" undocumented immigrants, Johnson replied: "Of course, that is the first step. We have to secure the border, we have to give the American public confidence that we're going to actually secure the border. "And then, we're a compassionate nation. We're going to deal with that reality of 11 to 12 million people. By the way, in our hearings, (we were told) 8.1 million of those people in this country illegally are working, and most of them are working hard, contributing to their communities. This is an untenable situation, we need to bring those people out of the shadows, but first we need to secure the border." If Johnson’s statistical claim is accurate, two-thirds or more of undocumented immigrants are employed. But his description of the 8 million as workers overstates the situation a bit. The figures The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not attempt to count the number of unauthorized immigrants who are working. But we found estimates, based on census data, that were made by the the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. They are from a July 2015 report and a November 2014 report. As of 2014, there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, Pew said, in an estimate roughly the same as one by the Department of Homeland Security. According to Pew: Most of them live in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Half are Mexican. Regarding work, Pew estimated that in 2012 there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants who were either working or looking for work -- that is, they were in the labor force -- people ages 16 and older who are employed or looking for work. Pew told us it does not have a breakdown on how many were working and how many were looking for work. When we asked Johnson’s office for information to back his statement, the office cited verbal testimony from Pew senior demographer Jeffrey Passel, the author of the research we've cited. He appeared before Johnson's committee in March 2015. Passel told the committee: "Although unauthorized immigrants represent about three and a half percent of the nation’s population, the 8.1 million unauthorized immigrant workers account for about 5 percent of the labor force." So, Passel referred to the 8.1 million as workers, but also to the labor force, which counts workers and people looking for work. Our rating Johnson said 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people "in this country illegally are working." His statement goes a bit too far. The latest estimates from a nonpartisan research group show that as of 2012, there were 8.1 million undocumented immigrants in the labor force -- some working, others looking for work. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. More on Ron Johnson Says Democratic challenger Russ Feingold "was the deciding vote on Obamacare (Mostly False)" "The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no on this deal, and I think the United States Congress should have the exact same input into the process.

pomt-06344	"A couple retiring today will pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits. ... about 3 bucks in benefits for every dollar in taxes."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/08/rob-portman/retiring-couples-get-3-medicare-benefits-each-1-pa/	The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, better known as the congressional "super committee," has a deadline of Nov. 23 to come up with a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Democrats on the bipartisan, 12-member panel offered a proposal in late October that included about $400 billion in cuts to Medicare. While the plan had no chance of winning approval from the committee's Republicans, who have said they will not accept a package with tax increases, it underlined the point that any plan is certain to make cuts to federal entitlement programs, especially Medicare. The super committee's co-chair, Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, noted in a hearing on Nov. 1 that President Obama had called Medicare and Medicaid "the single biggest drivers of the federal deficit and the federal debt by a huge margin." More attention focused on health care in the hearing, which featured testimony by the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles. Sen. Rob Portman at one point described Medicare now as an unsustainable program. "A couple retiring today will pay about $119,000 in lifetime Medicare taxes and receive about $357,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits," the Ohio Republican said. "So that's about 3 bucks in benefits for every dollar in taxes. If you multiply this by the 77 million retiring baby boomers, it's not hard to see why we have an unsustainable program." PolitiFact Ohio knew the prospects for Medicare sustaining itself weren’t good, but we were surprised at the 3-to-1 ratio of benefits to taxes, particularly because of the popular belief among recipients that "you earned it, you paid for it." We asked Portman's office for background. They referred us to a study from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan public policy organization. Authored by fellow Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury Department official, the widely cited study was published early this year and subsequently updated. It says a two-income couple in which both partners earned an average wage ($43,500 each in 2011) and retired in 2011 would pay $119,000 in Medicare taxes and receive $357,000 in benefits. We looked more closely at the study and found that the ratio was even more skewed for a single-income couple. "Over a wide range of scenarios, beneficiaries retiring at age 65 in 2011 can expect to receive dramatically more in total benefits than they have paid in dedicated taxes," it concluded. "If only one member of the couple had worked, we calculate a six-fold difference between contributions and benefits since both spouses are eligible for Medicare yet only one has paid taxes." Looking at the bigger picture, the report said, "It is no wonder these programs now account for one-third of all federal spending each year." The study, which was updated specifically to inform super committee discussions, concluded that "changes to entitlement programs are inevitable as part of a sound fiscal policy." It asserted that anything short of a comprehensive, overall view would merely be tinkering. Its bottom line: "Tax rates that have not kept pace with ever-rising benefit levels, increasing years of support, spiraling health costs, and fewer workers per retiree all imply that current and future generations of workers are going to have to do something to get these elderly benefit programs into order, either by paying higher taxes or receiving fewer benefits for themselves." We make no ruling on those difficult choices. The difficult situation described by Portman is another matter. On the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates True.

pomt-11444	"The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2018/mar/13/donald-trump/no-mr-president-california-not-begging-wall/	During his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego, President Donald Trump made this confounding claim: "The state of California is begging us to build walls" along the border. Deep blue California is "begging" the federal government to build a wall? Really? The president’s statement seemed false on its face, but we dug in for a fact-check just to make sure. Our research Here’s Trump’s full statement made March 13, 2018: "For the people that say 'no wall,' if you had no walls over here, you wouldn’t have a country. The state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas. They don’t tell you that. And we said no, we won’t do it until we build the whole wall." We asked Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s office about Trump’s statement. A spokesman for the governor indicated he had no idea what Trump was talking about. "We gave up trying to translate – and fully understand – the tweets and extemporaneous thoughts of the president long ago," Evan Westrup said in an email. Others rejected Trump’s claim outright: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democratic candidate for governor and top Trump critic, tweeted: "California is not "begging" you for this wall. Your wall is a waste of money and is literally impossible to complete. It will look more like a piece of swiss cheese than an insurmountable barrier. It's nothing more than a 6th century solution to a 21st century problem." "Not exactly sure where he got that from" Immigration and environmental experts said the state of California, at least in recent years, hasn’t expressed any desire to build a border wall. "Not at all," said Louis DeSipio, a UC Irvine political science professor who studies immigration. "I’m not exactly sure where (Trump) got that from. Perhaps he heard it from some local sheriff who wants a wall." "It’s been increasingly difficult to make sense of the things this administration says, and President Trump in particular," added Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity. The environmental group and state government were part of a recent lawsuit against the federal government’s plans to build the wall in California. Federal judge Gonzalo Curiel rejected their argument about environmental concerns and ruled the Trump administration could move forward on the project. Not the first confusing claim This is not the first time Trump has made a strange claim about California’s desire to build sections of a border wall. On Feb. 28, 2018, following the judge’s ruling, Trump tweeted: "I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!" National news outlets attempted to make sense of that tweet, without success. A Politico article assessed the tweet this way: "It was not clear what Trump meant in suggesting that 'California wants' a border wall 'now,' since the state opposed his administration’s efforts. White House spokespeople did not immediately return emails seeking further clarity regarding the president’s post and whether the administration intends to delay work in California even after securing a judicial victory." We found an interview with one top California Democrat, Attorney General Xavier Beccera, indicating he could support a barrier at the border, but no statements where top leaders are "begging" for a wall. Becerra told the Los Angeles Times in September 2017 that he supports "doing what our experts tell us we should do" on border security, whether that includes a physical barrier, more troops on the ground or virtual enforcement through aerial detection or surveillance. On the day of Trump’s California visit, Becerra was stronger in his response to Trump. He told Fox News, "We’ve always called for border security on a bipartisan basis, but building walls, that’s a medieval technology that really doesn’t have a place in the 21st century" Perhaps Trump meant Californians, and not their state government, want the wall? But even in that case, the president is wrong. A September 2017 survey showed 68 percent of likely voters in the state oppose building a wall along the entire southern border. The White House responded to a request for evidence after publication. We have included its response at the end of this fact check. Our ruling President Trump claimed "the state of California is begging us to build walls in certain areas," along the border. "They don’t tell you that." There’s no evidence backing up the president’s mystifying statement. If anything, California and its Democratic leaders are some of the strongest opponents of Trump’s border wall, at least as he’s promoted it. Some state leaders rejected Trump’s claim outright while others said they had no idea what he was talking about. We rated Trump’s claim Pants On Fire. UPDATE: A White House spokesman responded to our request for evidence after publication. He cited "great efforts" by the federal government "to collaborate with local and state authorities" on a two-mile border wall replacement project in Imperial County east of San Diego. The federal government plans to replace an existing barrier in that county with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall. The spokesman also cited a budget plan to create "14 miles of new border wall system that will replace existing secondary fence in the San Diego Sector." While this show the federal government’s interest in replacing sections of border barriers, they do not support or even speak to Trump’s claim "the state of California is begging to build walls" along the border. Our rating remains Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-09810	Preventive care "saves money."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/	President Barack Obama defended his health care plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress, promoting the benefits of reform for those who already have coverage. One of those benefits, he said, is that insurers will be required to cover checkups and other preventive care. "Insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies — because there’s no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse," Obama said. "That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives." It may make sense and save lives, but does it save money? Experts say no. The head of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number-crunching for Congress, has said this isn't the case, despite claims from many Democrats to the contrary. "The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive: "But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. . . Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it." In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on. The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in bills being considered in the House of Representatives because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching," according to the paper. "Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, "as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs." So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it won't reduce government spending on health care. As a result, we rate Obama's statement False.

pomt-00935	"Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/24/blog-posting/high-schoolers-had-recite-islamic-prayer-class-mak/	A spat between parents and administrators over a Seminole County high school history lesson in Islam has simmered into a minor cause célèbre for online critics. Ron Wagner of Longwood complained to a local TV station that his 15-year-old son was required to recite an Islamic prayer as part of a world history class at Lyman High School. The students also had to make an Islamic prayer rug as a homework assignment, according to Wagner, who said lessons like that don’t belong in public schools. "There’s a difference between teaching of the significance or the impact of a religion and teaching the specific tenets of the religion," Wagner told WFTV on Feb 9, 2015. Blogs and right-leaning media seized on the report, decrying the lessons as attempts to indoctrinate students. One blog, DownTrend.com, featured a post on Feb. 12 with the headline, "Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs." We don’t mean to pick on this one site -- because there are many, many other places that have reblogged the report -- and the writer did update the story after we asked him some questions. But the headline encapsulated the alleged events that have outraged so many people. Were students forced to recite an Islamic prayer and make prayer rugs at Lyman High School? PolitiFact Florida did our own homework. Taking notes Wagner met with Seminole County Public Schools administrators on Oct. 17, 2014, to discuss concerns about his son’s 10th grade world history class. Wagner alleged the class had been told to recite the first of the five pillars of Islam as printed in their textbook -- "There is no god, but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God." The prayer, known as the shahada, is an affirmation of faith among Muslims. Wagner also complained about 100 pages missing from his son’s history book and assignments to make Islamic prayer rugs and watch videos about Muslims. He said the teacher had contacted his son directly about the assignments via text messages, without his parents’ knowledge. Wagner’s wife, Lisa Huston, told PolitiFact Florida she and her husband believed the school district was favoring Islam, and that the missing pages were possibly removed deliberately. The textbook, published by Prentice Hall, has been singled out by some Florida and national groups for allegedly being pro-Islam, although it is approved by districts nationwide. District executive director of secondary education Michael Blasewitz conducted an investigation in October to determine if Wagner’s allegations were legitimate. Blasewitz concluded the teacher hadn’t violated any rules. Blasewitz repeated to PolitiFact Florida that the state has included Islam in its world history guidelines, and that Judaism and Christianity both are taught during the sixth grade, which the Florida Department of Education confirmed. You can read the entire district investigation report, but here are the highlights. Text messages: Wagner’s son had enrolled in Remind 101, in which students sign up for a third-party text messaging service for teachers to contact pupils about homework or class events. Blasewitz said parents were allowed to opt in. Missing textbook pages: The district found that 68 of the year-old textbooks lost pages from a binding error. Teachers had reported the problem, but Blasewitz said the school didn’t tell the district. Pearson, the publisher, replaced all the faulty copies, he said. (The missing chapters do include more information on Judaism and Christianity in the context of earlier civilizations.) Videos: The students watched short videos, including a TED Talk about stereotypes featuring an unidentified Iranian-American comedian. While the video did not violate guidelines, the district said a more straightforward selection should be made in future classes. Prayer rugs: Students were told to create prayer rugs, but the lesson was an assignment about Islamic art and not worship. The students were told they could incorporate any religious icons they wanted, as long as they observed Islamic artistic values, including no depictions of people or animals. The district said the assignment could be seen as controversial and recommended that a different art assignment "would be more appropriate." Prayer recitation: Blasewitz interviewed 10 students in the teacher’s two world history classes, and only one remembered the whole class being made to recite the prayer. Other students recalled following the book together in class, and the teacher gave extra credit to students who volunteered to read aloud. The teacher may have written the pillars of Islam on the board, they said, but did not make the students say any of them. Huston insisted to us that at least one other student in a different class period remembered an event similar to her son’s version of events, but Blasewitz said no other complaints had been filed. Our ruling DownTrend.com’s headline read, "Students In Fla. High School Forced To Recite Islamic Prayer, Make Prayer Rugs." This makes it sound as if students were being indoctrinated into a religion, and that's not the case. Instead, students were studying the religion of Islam as part of a world history class. According to a district investigation, pupils were assigned to make prayer rugs as an art assignment. The district recommended a different art assignment be made from now on. As for reciting the pillars of Islam in class, only one student complained his class was made to read the shahada. The investigation cited a notable lack of evidence that anyone was forced to recite a prayer. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14378	The Mitchell Park Domes "lose about $1 million-plus every year" and "the number of people going to the Domes has been going down."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/18/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-mitchell-park-domes-cost-taxpayer/	In February, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele declared the Mitchell Park Domes must be closed, at least temporarily, after chunks of concrete fell from high above. Meanwhile, a consultant told the county it could cost $65 million to $75 million to repair the deteriorating Domes, which house plants from around the world. Almost overnight, the future of the popular attraction became a key issue in the April 5, 2016 election between Abele and challenger Chris Larson, a Democratic state senator. Larson calls the three-dome complex a county treasure and vows to keep the facility running. Abele has been more open to a change, even suggesting residents may prefer something else, such as an amphitheater, to replace them. In a March 3, 2016 interview on WISN-TV, Abele argued it is important to keep options open because the Domes are expensive to operate and not as popular as in past years. "What most people don't know is that the Domes lose $1 million-plus each year," he said in the interview. "The number of people going to the Domes has been going down." That doesn’t sound good. But the county’s own web site offers a different take. "The Domes run an annual operating deficit averaging $630,000 per year, even as attendance has increased," it says, crediting creative programming. Indeed, that programming has taken place under Abele’s watch. So, which is right? Losing money Unlike a freestanding business, the Domes don’t report a "loss" when expenses exceed revenue. Rather, the difference falls to county taxpayers. The loss refers to how much in general property tax money it costs to keep the attraction open, above and beyond admissions and space rental fees (and after expenses). County figures show that going back five years, taxpayer support has ranged from a low of $386,803 in 2015 to a high of $1.11 million in 2014. That was the only year the loss topped $1 million, undermining the "each year" part of Abele’s claim. The average amount spent by taxpayers in that five-year period was $628,000 – just about what the county’s web site said. A memo provided by Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said that "spikes in expenses in recent years are due to engineering studies and significant remedial work completed on the structure." The costs for 2016, of course, are likely to be higher. For instance, the county plans to spend $500,000 on netting and other measures so the facility can reopen while officials sort out its long-term future. Attendance Likewise, the numbers show the opposite of what Abele claimed when it comes to attendance. There has been a steady increase in the past five years, from 187,658 in 2011 – the first year that Abele was in office – to 240,179 in 2015. Baldauff acknowledged the recent growth in attendance, but noted: "In the past the Domes saw annual attendance of more than 374,000 people." She added: "We are far away from the attendance the Domes used to see." We asked: When did the Domes last have 374,000 visitors? The answer: 1988. But that was a generation ago. There have undoubtedly been ups and downs over the years since, but there’s no question attendance has been on the rise. Our rating Abele says the Domes lose more than $1 million every year and that the number of people visiting the attraction has been declining. He’s wrong on both counts. In the past five years, the tab for county taxpayers exceeded $1 million once. On average it was $630,000. Meanwhile, attendance has actually increased 28 percent under his watch. We rate his claim False.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2016-03-18T10:00:00	2016-03-03	['None']
pomt-07168	Because Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a 30-bill job creation package, "New Jersey ranks 50th in the nation in job creation."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/12/lou-greenwald/assemblyman-lou-greenwald-says-gov-chris-christies/	Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) wants to blame Gov. Chris Christie’s veto pen for New Jersey’s last-place finish in the nation for job growth. But with his own timing, the legislator is guilty of a false start. As the state’s budget battle raged in Trenton, the Assembly Democrats on May 12 posted a video on their website -- www.assemblydems.com -- where Greenwald launched yet another attack on Christie. In an accompanying message that day on Greenwald’s Facebook page, the assemblyman said: "The Governor vetoed our 30 bill job creation package to put New Jerseyans back to work. Unfortunately, now New Jersey ranks 50th in the nation in job creation as a result." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to explore Greenwald’s argument, and found an inherent timing conflict between when the governor’s vetoes occurred and Greenwald’s job growth statistics. First, let’s talk about that veto pen. The Assembly Democrats on May 18 provided a list of 33 bills comprising the "Back to Work NJ Economic Development Package." Of those bills, 30 were passed by the Assembly and the Senate by early January, and another was passed by both houses by mid-February, according to the Legislature’s website. Two bills were passed only in the Assembly, never making it to the governor’s desk. Of the 31 bills submitted to Christie by the time of Greenwald’s statement, the governor signed 13 and vetoed 18. After Greenwald’s statement, Christie signed one of the bills that he had conditionally vetoed. The Legislature had incorporated his recommendations. Greenwald, who is chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, is clearly wrong when he says the governor vetoed a "30 bill job creation package." As far as whether those vetoes are to blame for New Jersey’s job growth ranking, here’s the problem: Christie vetoed those bills in February and March. But when we checked with Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, about where Greenwald got his job growth rankings, Hester pointed us to federal data on job growth from December 2009 to December 2010. That means, according to Greenwald’s logic, Christie’s vetoes in February and March were to blame for a lack of job growth through the previous December. Asked about this timing conflict, Brian McGinnis, Greenwald’s communications director, emailed us a "clarification," which read as follows: "The reason why the Legislature passed a job creation package was to stimulate an economy struggling to create jobs that was on a worrisome trend. With the Governor’s failure to sign those bills, it destines New Jersey to continue falling further behind and stay dead last in the nation in job creation." But did Greenwald admit his original statement was wrong? McGinnis told us: "The clarification speaks for itself." Now, let’s take a closer look at those job growth rankings. Hester directed us to a chart on page 2 of a Feb. 4 report from the Pennsylvania-based, liberal-leaning Keystone Research Center. According to that chart -- based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- New Jersey ranked 50th for the number of seasonally adjusted jobs created from December 2009 to December 2010. But since Greenwald made his comments in May, PolitiFact New Jersey was looking for more recent figures. Keystone Research Center told us that for the period from March 2010 to March 2011 -- the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics available at the time of Greenwald’s statement -- New Jersey ranked 49th in both the number of jobs created and the percent change in jobs. To be more specific, New Jersey lost 1,700 jobs from March 2010 to March 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data at the time of Greenwald's statement. Kansas and New Mexico were the only other states to have job losses during that same time period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To explain New Jersey’s economic plight, experts from Rutgers University pointed to the loss of government jobs in 2010 and climbing tax rates during the last decade. Those increases helped erase the state’s previous reputation as a low-cost place to do business. It’s worth noting that a less awful picture emerges when the study period is narrowed. Doug Hall of the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, ran the numbers for us and determined that from September 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 37th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change. From December 2010 to March 2011, New Jersey ranked 36th in the number of jobs created and 43rd in percent change. "There are signs of hope, I suppose," said Hall, director of EPI’s Economic Analysis and Research Network. In regard to New Jersey's job figures between March 2010 and March 2011, the analyses performed by the Keystone Research Center and Hall were based on federal data for seasonally adjusted jobs available at the time of Greenwald's statement. After a decade where private sector jobs sunk by 153,700 and government jobs rose by 68,800, New Jersey is starting to head in the other direction, according to James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. In the first quarter of 2011, New Jersey added 6,100 private jobs -- more than the number added in all of 2010, Hughes said. The government sector may stabilize during 2012 and the "private-sector growth is already back," he said in an email. "The only caution is a national economy which shows signs of weakening, which will feed back to NJ," Hughes wrote in the email. Returning to Greenwald’s statement, let’s review: Greenwald overstated the number of Christie’s vetoes from February and March, and claimed they are why New Jersey ranks 50th in job growth. But a spokesman said Greenwald’s rankings were based on data from between December 2009 and December 2010. Greenwald’s rankings aren’t far off from more recent calculations that show New Jersey ranks 49th in a year-over-year comparison. Yet when we look at three- and six-month periods, the Garden State is faring a little bit better. But Greenwald’s biggest mistake here is to blame Christie’s vetoes from February and March for employment changes that occurred several months earlier. That makes the claim not just wrong, but ridiculously wrong. Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com.

pomt-03210	Says Terry McAuliffe is "the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/26/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinell-overstates-mcauliffes-role-lincoln-bedro/	The Lincoln Bedroom in the White House looms in this year’s gubernatorial race. Within the history of the ornate chamber, Republican Ken Cuccinelli says, lies proof of Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s questionable ethics. "He’s the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom," Cuccinelli said of his opponent during an Aug. 10 appearance before Northern Virginia business leaders. Cuccinelli is referring to details of a scandal that erupted in 1997 as Congress investigated charges that President Bill Clinton and McAuliffe masterminded a program that allowed top patrons of the Democratic Party to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. McAuliffe, at the time, was finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee. We looked into the claim that the White House sleepovers were McAuliffe’s idea. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, sent an email citing a variety of old news reports and copies of documents that she said prove "the Lincoln Bedroom scandal originated from a McAuliffe memo." So let’s travel back in time. On Dec. 27, 1994, McAuliffe had breakfast with Clinton in the White House. A month earlier, mid-term elections established Republican majorities in the House for the first time in 40 years and in the Senate for the first time in eight years. McAuliffe wanted to come up with a plan to reconnect demoralized Democratic supporters with Clinton in preparation for the president’s reelection two years later. About a week after the meeting, McAuliffe sent a memo to Nancy Hernreich, Clinton’s director of Oval Office operations, suggesting the president meet party supporters at meals, coffees, golf games and morning jogs. McAuliffe also listed ten of the party’s "top supporters." In his 2009 book, "What a Party," McAuliffe wrote that he thought there was "nothing controversial" about the memo. "A candidate was going to spend time with his supporters. What a shocker that was," he wrote. "I was careful how I worded the memo because the Clinton White House leaked like a sieve, and the only question in my mind was how many minutes it would take before a copy of this memo would be hand-delivered to The Washington Post. Little did I know that this would become the infamous Lincoln Bedroom Memo." The one-page note became the focus a probe by congressional Republicans into fundraising at the Clinton White House. The memo did not propose that donors should stay overnight at the White House, but the prospect of sleepovers was mentioned in notes that were later scrawled on the front and back of the document. Hernreich said in a June 20, 1997, deposition to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she wrote the word "overnights" on the front of the memo, next to the list of ten top supporters. "I don’t honestly know if that was my idea or if it was the president’s idea and under what circumstances I wrote that," Hernreich said. Donald Bucklin, an attorney for the committee, asked Hernreich if the sleepovers idea could have come from any conversation she might have had with McAuliffe. "If I indeed had that conversation with Terry -- I’m not certain I did -- but if I indeed had it, then it could have, although it just as well could not have come from him," Hernreich said. "Honestly, I just don’t know, really." On the back of the memo, Clinton wrote a note to Hernreich saying "ready to start overnights right away." McAuliffe told the committee in a June 6, 1997 deposition that he never got his memo back with the notes written on it. McAuliffe denied coming up with the idea for the overnights. But he acknowledged to Gus Puryear, an attorney for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, that the DNC recommended donors who should be invited to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. Puryear: Did you ever personally propose that someone be included in an overnight stay at the White House? McAuliffe: "Generally Gus, how this would happen is someone may call and say they’d like to do it. I would have turned it over to (DNC staffers), and they probably would have sent it to the political office. There were many recommendations, I believe, from many people." Puryear: "Do you remember any person that you recommended?" McAuliffe: "I cannot, no, but I’m not saying they didn’t call my office. I take a lot of pride in what I did and how I did it. I was not a concierge service." So who came up with idea for the sleepovers? Clinton, in a February 1997 deposition, said it was his brainchild. "Terry McAuliffe sent a memo suggesting things we ought to do to re-establish contact, which I thought was a good memo. And I told him to proceed," Clinton said, according to a Feb. 27, 1997, New York Times reprint of his remarks. "And I told Nancy Hernreich in addition to that that I wanted to ask some of my friends who had helped me when I got elected President, that I hadn’t been in touch with, to come to the White House and spend the night with me." Clinton maintained the White House overnights were not intended to rev up donations, saying "the Lincoln Bedroom was never sold." But the GOP investigation concluded the stays were "an important means by which the DNC raised funds from contributors." It pointed to a White House document that listed 51 "long-time friends" who stayed overnight. Forty-nine of those people, the GOP said, contributed a total of $4.1 million to the DNC for the 1996 elections. Democratic members, in their own findings said that "the committee found no evidence of a systematic scheme to trade overnight visits at the White House for campaign contributions." Cuccinelli’s campaign, in backing its claim that McAuliffe came up with the sleepover plan, also directed us to an editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times on Sept. 7, 1999, that said McAuliffe is known in Washington as "the guy who invented the idea of having President Clinton invite major campaign contributors to be lured and rewarded with sleepover nights in the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House." The campaign also cited a Feb. 2, 2001, editorial in The New York Times that criticized McAuliffe for supporting Clinton’s fundraising schemes, calling him "a walking symbol of the wretched excess of the Clinton years." Our ruling Cuccinelli, in attacking McAuliffe’s ethics, says the Democrat is "the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom." McAuliffe authored a memo in early 1995 listing ways Clinton could connect with top Democratic patrons. But the original note did not mention White House sleepovers; that idea was later added in the handwriting of others. McAuliffe has always denied he came up with the scheme; Clinton in 1997 took full responsibility for the idea. No doubt, McAuliffe strongly backed the sleepovers and recommended heavy hitters that should be offered a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. But we see no evidence that McAuliffe "invented the scheme." We rate Cuccinelli’s statement False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-08-26T05:00:00	2013-08-10	['None']
pomt-09915	During a town hall meeting on health care, "ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/30/lamar-smith/abc-broadcast-networks-controversial-issue-ads/	Rep. Lamar Smith was outraged that ABC News was dedicating a day of coverage to health care reform, capping it off with an exclusive town hall with President Barack Obama. "It was like a rigged football game," Smith told Greta Van Susteren during an interview on Fox News. "The president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." Smith, a Republican from Texas, made his comments even before the special aired on June 24, 2009. We wanted to know if it was true that ABC "didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." A call to ABC confirmed that this was true. Though ABC accepts advertising for political candidates, it has a policy of rejecting ads that advocate for general political issues, a spokeswoman told us. We tried to ask more detailed questions about the policy, but she wouldn't talk about specifics. We were able to find several news reports about ABC rejecting other ads over the years, including ads that opposed the oil industry and the Iraq war. Adding another wrinkle, local ABC affiliates set their own standards to sell ads. Naturally, viewers at home have no way of knowing if the ad was sold by the local affiliate or the parent network. Smith complained after the advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights tried and failed to buy ads during the president's town hall. The group is opposed to Democratic plans for the health care system because they say it would create a socialized medical system similar to Canada's or Britain's. (We examined one of their ads back in April and rated a claim about health effectiveness research as Barely True .) Conservatives for Patients' Rights disputed ABC's claim that it did not accept advocacy ads. In a letter to ABC, the group cited a report from TNS Media Intelligence, a respected independent media firm, that showed ad buys by T. Boone Pickens, who argues for energy independence, and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which promotes fiscal responsibility. We asked Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the major network news programs at his Web site the Tyndall Report, about advocacy ads appearing on the networks. He said it's true that ABC and the other major networks forbid issue advocacy ads, but there is a gray area: The networks will accept public-interest ads from lobbying groups that are generally positive in tone and message. These types of ads usually air during the Sunday morning shows, he said. "You can't address matters of public controversy in those. You can only burnish your image," Tyndall said. In theory, if Conservatives for Patients' Rights had designed an ad that talked about how wonderful the private insurance system is, that might have passed muster with ABC. "You can say the good part, but not the bad part," Tyndall concluded. The network's rules are internal standards that are holdovers from the days when broadcast networks were more closely regulated, Tyndall said. In fact, advocacy ads usually air on local affiliates and cable channels, and there are several reasons for this, said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group that is part of TNS Media Intelligence. On cable news channels, advertisers feel like they're reaching a demographic that includes news junkies and policymakers. When Congress is in session, advocacy groups will buy time with affiliates in Washington, D.C. That advertising follows members of Congress home to local affiliates during the breaks, especially if the member is a swing vote or chairs a committee with jurisdiction over a particular issue. The handful of national networks, though, just want to avoid controversy. "By and large, historically, they've stayed away from this stuff as much as possible, though no one is 100 percent pure," Tracey said. "There's probably stuff they've taken in the past where the salespeople said, 'This isn't very controversial,' and so they took it." In this case, things may have worked out well for both sides, Tracey said. "ABC is probably happy they didn't take the spot, and Conservatives for Patients' Rights is just as happy because they didn't have to pay for it, and they still get their publicity." The congressman is right, though. He said, "ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired." Groups who opposed Obama's plan tried to buy advertising during his town hall meeting and were turned down. Even ABC said that was the case. We rate Smith's statement True.

pomt-03151	"Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60. After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/10/karl-rove/rove-says-public-tends-rally-behind-military-actio/	With attacks on Syria being debated in Washington, public opinion stands clearly opposed to a military strike. A new CNN/ORC poll shows about 60 percent of Americans think Congress should refuse to authorize the use of force. Even as an offer of Syrian chemical weapons destruction takes shape, the White House is lobbying hard to sway undecided lawmakers, hoping that classified briefings will nudge them into going against the views of their constituents. Political strategist Karl Rove gave the administration a bit of ammunition as it tries to win support for a resolution. The public’s views are flexible, he said. "Before President Obama acted in Libya in 2011, the American people were opposed to military action by 35 to 60," Rove said on Fox News Sunday. "After he took action, they were in support of it 54 to 43." Rove’s point? "The American people do have an animus against any kind of action, but if you take action, and you’re successful, they applaud it," he said. We went back to the record to check whether at the end of the day, public opinion can change direction so completely and so quickly. Rove’s office told us that if anything, Rove’s claim understated the swing in public opinion back in 2011. Three days before Tomahawk missiles struck Libyan air defenses, a Fox News poll showed just 25 percent of the people in favor when asked "Do you favor or oppose the U.S. military getting involved with the situation in Libya?" Those against stood at 65 percent. That was in mid-March 2011. By the end of August, a CNN/ORC poll showed 54 percent said they favored the U.S. military action in Libya, while 43 percent were against it. The timeline It helps to get a sense of what was going on in Libya when these polls were taken. As this timeline shows, the international community quickly rallied to the cause of the protesters who sought to overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but the conflict lasted through most of the year. February 2011 -- Popular protests begin, prompting a violent government crackdown. By the end of the month, the UN Security Council had issued a statement condemning the Libyan regime, imposed sanctions and referred Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. March 17, 2011 -- The UN Security Council approves a no-fly zone and the use of all necessary measures to protect civilians. March 19, 2011 -- British, French and American forces move to enforce the no-fly zone, starting with missile attacks to destroy Libyan air defenses. March 24, 2011 -- NATO takes command of the mission to enforce the no-fly zone. April - August 2011 -- Air strikes continue. Special forces from Britain, France, Jordan and Qatar aid the rebels on the ground. August 20, 2011 -- Rebel and Gadhafi loyalists battle in Tripoli. October 20, 2011 -- Rebels capture and kill Gadhafi. Opinions shift, questions matter The earliest poll we found came from the Pew Research Center. Taken around March 13, it showed a clear distaste for the military options. A slight majority favored economic and diplomatic sanctions, but nearly 70 percent opposed arming the rebels, 77 percent opposed bombing Libyan air defenses, and 82 percent opposed sending ground troops. This was very much in line with the Fox News poll. As soon as the missiles were launched, public opinion changed. On March 20, pollsters from CBS News posed this question: "As you may know, the U.S. military and other countries have begun cruise missile and air strikes in Libya in order to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi's forces. Do you approve or disapprove of the U.S. and other countries taking this military action in Libya?" Nearly 70 percent of respondents said they approved. But slightly different questions revealed a more closely divided public. Polls at the end of March from Pew Research Center and NBC News/Wall Street Journal asked simply if people thought military engagement was the right or wrong decision. The question did not mention protecting civilians, and support dropped. Both polls found that half the people thought it was the right choice. About 40 percent thought it was the wrong decision and about 10 percent didn’t know. At the very end, in early November 2011, after Gadhafi was dead and a transitional government took over, CBS News asked if the United States had done the right thing by getting involved militarily. Only 37 percent thought the country had done the right thing. Nearly half said America never should have gotten involved. This was well before the attacks on the American diplomatic post in Benghazi, which happened nearly a year later, in 2012. Our ruling Rove said there was a major swing in public opinion from before military action in Libya began to after. In varying degrees, we found polling results that support that conclusion. In general, once the missiles fly, the public tends to take a more favorable view of military engagement. However, some polls found only a modest shift, and much depended on how the question was asked. Overall, the public remained closely divided on the American role in Libya. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2013-09-10T14:38:11	2013-09-08	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama', 'Libya']
pomt-12149	Last year, Democrats won nearly 50% of the vote, yet they hold only 38% of the seats in the state House and 30% of the seats in the state Senate.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/aug/09/roy-cooper/cooper-says-dems-won-nearly-half-2016-vote-hold-on/	The concept of gerrymandering is easy to understand – someone re-draws election districts to favor one political party over another. But it can be difficult to prove or demonstrate. Some point to the party affiliation of voters in a district. (Does a district have more registered Democrats than Republicans?) Some simply point to jagged lines and odd district shapes on an election map. Gov. Roy Cooper, to illustrate gerrymandering in North Carolina, recently compared the number of votes cast in the 2016 general election to the number of seats Democrats hold in the legislature. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling that N.C. General Assembly election maps drawn by state lawmakers were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Judges recently told state legislators to redraw district maps by Sept. 1. In a July 28 email newsletter, Cooper’s campaign "Cooper for North Carolina" asked supporters for donations to help the governor’s push for fair maps. "Last year, Democrats won nearly 50% of the vote, yet they hold only 38% of the seats in the State House and 30% of the seats in the State Senate," the newsletter claims. The claim implies that some voters’ ballots count far more than others. But is it true? The second part of the claim is accurate.. In the state House, 46 of 120 members are Democrats. In the state Senate, 15 of the 50 members are Democrats. Those percentages check out. The first part of the quote doesn’t specify which Democrats Cooper is talking about, and the full newsletter doesn’t elaborate. A reader might assume it’s referring to the votes cast for the state House and Senate. But campaign spokesman Morgan Jackson says the Democrats who received nearly 50 percent of the vote were those in "all major 2016 races" – not just General Assembly elections. The campaign pointed out the low number of Democrats in the state House and state Senate "to illustrate that North Carolina is a true swing state and Republicans in the General Assembly have unconstitutionally gerrymandered the legislature," Jackson said. Jackson said the campaign looked at the races for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, state House, state Senate, governor and other Council of State races. Council of State races include the lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, superintendent of public instruction, labor commissioner, insurance commissioner and agriculture commissioner. In the races identified by Cooper’s campaign, Democrats won 47.4 percent of the vote, according to the elections board. They garnered about 32.1 million out of 67.8 million total votes, while Republicans got about 35 million votes. Libertarians and unaffiliated candidates got the remaining 671,000 votes. Defining 'nearly' How close were Democrats to drawing 50 percent of the vote, or 33.9 million votes? About 1.7 million votes. Does that constitute "nearly" 50 percent? In the world of statistics, the word "nearly" isn’t well-defined, said Len Stefanski, head of the N.C. State University Department of Statistics. "What a statistician can do is say, when voters are behaving more or less like coin tosses, is 47 percent different from 50 percent when you have 60 million coins tossed? The answer would be yes," Stefanski said. In other words, 1.7 million votes is too many to gloss over. The margin of error for stats that large is 0.012 percent, Stefanski said. On the other hand, people aren’t coins. They can be influenced by current events or even the media, he said. A sign of gerrymandering? Then there’s the issue of whether Democrats’ performance in statewide races, compared with the number of seats they hold in the legislature, is evidence of gerrymandering. Opinions vary. Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the NYU School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice, thinks the comparison is fair. "It’s on the right track," Li said. "The analysis might be a little more sophisticated than that or complicated than that." He said votes for, say, governor, don’t necessarily need to match representation of state legislative seats in order for election maps to be considered fair. "But you wouldn’t expect the disparities that you have," Li said, referring to North Carolina. Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, says people are better off determining redistricting bias by making apples-to-apples comparisons. "I don't think a discrepancy between partisan votes for higher office and seats held by a party in the legislature necessarily means anything," McGhee wrote in an email. "But a discrepancy between votes for the *legislature* and seats held in the legislature certainly can." There are 120 state House districts and 50 state Senate districts. More than 8.3 million votes were cast in those races. Democrats received a bit more than 3.7 million – 45 percent – and were 418,000 votes away from reaching 50 percent of the vote. When it comes to elections, 45 percent of the vote likely wouldn’t come close to qualifying for a recount. Whether it’s "nearly" 50 percent is subjective, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. "But I probably wouldn’t use it if I was describing a 53/47 two-way split in the electorate," Murray said in an email. McGhee, the expert in California, said voters should also consider uncontested races when weighing the fairness of election maps. Fifteen of the state Senate’s 50 districts went uncontested, while 56 of the state House’s 120 districts were uncontested. That means 41 percent of legislators ran unopposed in the November elections. Our ruling Cooper’s claims about Democratic representation in the state House and state Senate are accurate. His claim that Democrats won close to 50 percent of votes is slightly exaggerated if only legislative races are considered, but is closer to the mark when it comes to broad support for Democratic candidates. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2017-08-09T16:24:06	2017-07-28	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-08353	Rick Perry is "taking money away from hurricane victims" and diverting it to "remodel the Governor's Mansion."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/27/back-basics/back-basics-group-says-rick-perry-diverting-hurric/	Back to Basics, the political committee that's poured money into ads critical of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, reminds Texans of Hurricane Ike in a TV spot linking hurricane aid to the reconstruction of the Governor's Mansion, which was heavily damaged in a 2008 arson fire. Perry, the narrator says, "doesn't want to explain why he took money away from hurricane victims." Say what? "Here's what he did," the narrator says in the ad that debuted online Oct. 13. "After begging for federal hurricane aid, Perry is taking millions of it to remodel the Governor's Mansion so he can move in faster. Diverting disaster funds for himself." In an online post, Back to Basics says the claim that Perry's taking millions in hurricane aid is based in part on a May 2009 news article in The Houston Chronicle and an Oct. 2, 2010, column by humorist John Kelso of the Austin American-Statesman. The Chronicle article said state lawmakers at that time were poised to spend $11 million in federal stimulus funds on mansion repairs. But stimulus money did not get allocated to the mansion project after all. Rather, as Kelso's recent column says, about "half of the money for the mansion project originated as money that the feds provided to Texas to reimburse the state for its upfront emergency expenses for Hurricane Ike. Follow the money: $11 million from the feds was shuffled from the Department of Public Safety to the State Preservation Board to help pay for the $22 million mansion remodel." The spending directive, House Bill 4586, was unanimously approved by the 2009 Legislature and signed into law by Perry. It authorizes up to $11 million in "reimbursements received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency" to be spent on "costs associated with the restoration of the Governor's Mansion." Separately, a Sept. 24 American-Statesman news article -- which Back to Basics refers to at the start of its ad -- quotes John Sneed, executive director of the State Preservation Board, saying that because the $11 million earmarked for mansion repair was federal aid, the mansion repair project wasn't hit by the 5 percent budget reduction state leaders (including Perry) have sought from agencies. (Sneed told us in an interview that he never termed the money federal aid; rather, he said, he said it was reimbursement money.) Takeaway: Legislators and Perry agreed to spend $11 million in federal reimbursements for hurricane assistance on mansion repairs. But is that Perry taking aid away from hurricane victims to hurry the mansion work? To gauge that, we followed the money. For starters, we learned, the Texas Department of Public Safety spent state dollars responding to Hurricane Ike, which lashed Texas in September 2008. It appears that its spending was later covered by a transfer of $145 million from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. In a February 2009 letter, leaders including Perry authorized the transfer of HHSC funds to the DPS "for the purpose of reimbursing emergency preparedness and response expenses incurred as a result of Hurricane Ike." The letter says the funds were available because the federal government failed to approve the state's waiver request for an effort to help low-income working Texans obtain private health coverage. DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange told us via e-mail that the DPS has spent nearly $106 million reimbursing vendors, cities and counties for Hurricane Ike expenses, while also returning $25 million to the HHSC. Mange said about $112 million has been set aside by FEMA to cover expenses the federal agency decides are eligible for reimbursement. Big picture: State spends more than $100 million in state money on hurricane. Federal government covers eligible expenditures--and state lawmakers earmark some of that reimbursement money for the mansion work. As we explored this history, we realized the ticklish issue for the Republican-led Legislature and Perry may have been the spectre of spending federal aid appropriated by the Democratic-controlled Congress with the support of the Democratic president, Barack Obama, on the mansion occupied by the Republican governor. Hence, Texas legislators dropped the idea of spending stimulus aid on the mansion project. State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, recently acknowledged as much. In an Oct. 5 interview with the American-Statesman editorial board, Ogden said: "We didn't want to basically hard-wire (the mansion funding) in such a way that critics could say you used federal funds to rebuild the mansion. So we moved the money around." Allen Spelce, spokesman for the Texas state comptroller's office, told us the $11 million is considered state revenue because it made up for state-originated expenditures. Spelce pointed out too that the 2010-11 state budget shows no federal money going to the preservation board; its budget has two entries referring to the $11 million for the mansion work as general revenue, meaning state money. "It's different," Spelce told us, "than if this was some kind of federal grant, which is typically what you think of when you talk about federal funds." Katherine Cesinger, Perry's deputy press secretary, echoed Spelce, saying: "It's not being utilized for disasters, it's a reimbursement. You're splitting hairs here." We ran these interpretations past Back to Basics, whose executive director, Cliff Walker, insisted that the federal aid being used on the mansion was "originally intended to go toward reimbursement of those local communities and the public-assistance first responders" who helped victims of the hurricane. He also sent an e-mail stressing Sneed's September reference to the $11 million as federal aid. "As federal hurricane public assistance funds, then why have these dollars been used for the mansion? FEMA makes it clear that public assistance dollars are to be used to rebuild communities," Walker said. He referred us to a FEMA web page on the agency's Public Assistance Grant Program, which it says "provides supplemental federal disaster grant assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities and the facilities of certain Private Non-Profit (PNP) organizations." Our attempts to explore this with FEMA didn't yield an immediate interview. Our take: Whether the FEMA reimbursements to Texas amount to federal aid or not, the statement that Perry is "taking money away from hurricane victims" and diverting it to the mansion project is wrong on two fronts. First, FEMA set aside the money to cover agency costs already incurred in response to the hurricane; no victims are bereft as a result, far as we can tell. Secondly, the assignment of the funds to the mansion work was made by state lawmakers; Perry didn't earmark any money alone. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08518	In most Muslim countries, "We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/06/franklin-graham/rev-franklin-graham-says-churches-and-synagogues-a/	On ABC's This Week on Oct. 3, 2010, host Christiane Amanpour held a town hall debate on whether Americans should fear Islam. Naturally, the issue of the so-called Ground Zero mosque came up. Amanpour asked the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, about his comments following 9-11 that Islam is a "very evil and very wicked" religion. "I understand what the Muslims want to do in America," said Graham, president of both the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and the international Christian relief organization Samaritan's Purse. "They want to build as many mosques and cultural centers as they possibly can so they can convert as many Americans as they can to Islam. I understand that...I understand what they're doing. And I just don't have the freedom to do this in most Muslim countries. We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden." Imam Osama Bahloul, leader of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and a panelist on the show, said Graham was incorrect. "For someone to say we are not allowed to build a church in a Muslim country, this is absolutely not right. You can Google this," Bahloul said. We spoke to several experts on religion and government in Muslim countries. And the consensus was clear: there are, in fact, Christian churches and/or synagogues in almost every Muslim country. "Reverend Graham is wrong," said Yvonne Haddad, Professor of History of Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations at Georgetown University. "Churches are flourishing in Jordan and Syria. In Egypt, the Christians find restrictions on church construction which has recently been partially lifted." Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic relations, agreed that Graham was incorrect. "There are lots of Christian churches and synagogues in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Qatar, Kuwait ... If you go to any number of so-called Muslim countries you will see thriving Christian and Jewish populations." One member of the Iranian parliament is Jewish, Hooper noted. "The only one where you don't see it, where you can't have a Christian church or synagogue is Saudi Arabia," Hooper said. "It's only an issue in Saudi Arabia." The cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are considered the two holiest cities in Islam, explained Akbar S. Ahmed, chair of Islamic Studies at American University. And so, he said, no churches or synagogues are allowed there. "That is like the Vatican in terms of Catholicism," Ahmed said. But where he grew up in Pakistan, for example, Ahmed said, there is a huge Christian church. While there are now very few Christians left there, the building is deserted but remains untouched. After 1948, he said, most Jewish people living in Muslim countries migrated to Israel. But there are still many churches in Muslim countries, as well as synagogues. One of the top advisers to the king of Morocco is Jewish, he said. There may be periods of turmoil, or some narrow-minded leaders who have attacked churches over the years, Ahmed said, but there is nothing formalized in Islamic law that forbids the building of churches or synagogues. "Today, because of the general atmosphere in the air, there are many untruths being spread about Islam," Ahmed said. While the facts about whether most Muslim countries allow churches or synagogues is pretty cut-and-dried, there is another facet to this claim. Graham was speaking in the context of Muslims building mosques in order to convert people to Islam in the United States. And so we think it's fair to also look at whether it's possible to build a church or synagogue in most Muslim countries with the aim of converting people. And on that point, Graham is on firmer ground. According to a 2007 Council on Foreign Relations "backgrounder" on religious conversion and sharia law, authored by Lionel Beehner, "Conversion by Muslims to other faiths is forbidden under most interpretations of sharia and converts are considered apostates...Some Muslim clerics equate this apostasy to treason, a crime punishable by death." According to the report, while a vast majority of Muslim countries no longer prescribe death for apostates (instead opting for some lesser form of punishment), "some states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, still do hand out death sentences." Shireen Hunter, visiting professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, said that Graham "cannot be more wrong," about there being a prohibition against churches or synagogues in most Muslim countries. But, she said, "conversion is a totally different thing." There is a great deal of debate in the Muslim community about Islamic law regarding conversions. Some argue Islam teaches there is no compulsion to faith. And while enforcement of religious laws against conversion is more aggressively applied by some Muslim countries than others, "this is an issue that is there." In many countries in the Middle East, religion dictates your legal status as well, explained Nathan Brown, an expert on Islamic law at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. While legal enforcement of bans against conversions from Islam are rare in most Muslim countries, "conversions are practically difficult," he said. We think a Catholic church recently built in Qatar is a good example of how this is handled. According to a March 2007 Al Jazeera story about the construction of a Catholic church: "Although the country's native inhabitants are entirely Muslim -- and are prohibited by law from converting to another faith -- the new Catholic church will cater to the large number of Christian migrants who have come to the Arabia Gulf state in search of work." Archbishop Paul Hinder, the Catholic Church's Bishop of Arabia, explained in the story that he oversees churches in Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and even in Saudi Arabia, "the birthplace of Islam, where Christianity is practiced behind closed doors." On the Christian communities in Saudi Arabia, Hinder clarified: "It's not an open church. Privately the Christians may gather in their houses in a very discreet manner." We think Graham erred when he said that in most Muslim countries, "We can't have a church. We're not able to build synagogues. It's forbidden." That's demonstrably false. The construction of churches is not forbidden in most Muslim countries, only Saudi Arabia. And so, on balance, we rate Graham's comment False.

pomt-08451	Says Scott Walker "eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/15/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-gubernatorial-rival-scott-walker-/	In the wake of a major recession, and with state unemployment stubbornly high, there’s little surprise jobs have been a central focus in the Wisconsin governor’s race. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, is faulted by Republicans for job losses in the city. And Barrett is slamming Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, his GOP rival, for not doing enough from his office -- and even doing more harm than good. In a new television ad, titled "The Difference is Jobs," Barrett makes this claim: Scott Walker "eliminated his own office of economic development in the middle of this recession." That’s a pretty strong shot. But is it true? Let’s start with the recession piece of this: While economic times are still unquestionably tough, the official time frame for the Great Recession is December 2007 through June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The Barrett campaign is basing its claim on Walker’s two most recent budgets, for 2009 and 2010. In the 2009 budget, introduced in September 2008, Walker eliminated the county’s Economic Development Department, moved the seven staff members to other departments and downgraded the director position to a lower level bureaucrat. "We didn’t eliminate the office that office as much as reassign it," Walker said, when asked about the claim. He noted that the economic development activities already were limited -- such as handling real estate deals, low income housing and block grants. "It represents more of a realistic expectation of what the county is doing," Walker said at the time the office was moved. "We still very much want to play a role." In the fall of 2009, Walker switched gears and proposed creating a new county office of business development within his own office as part of the 2010 budget. He called for three staff members and a director. But the County Board approved only the position for the director, deleting the staffers. And it put the post in the Department of Transportation and Public Works. So, while the Barrett TV ad focuses on Walker’s action, it leaves out an important detail: the board’s involvement in approving -- or blocking -- the executive’s proposals. Additionally, the ad leaves the impression the county has played a large role in economic development. To be sure, there are economic development issues facing the county, from development of the County Grounds in Wauwatosa, to the sale of county land in the Park East Corridor in downtown Milwaukee, and increased interest in the area surrounding booming Mitchell International Airport. But the county has never placed as high a priority on economic development as the city, which has many more tools at its disposal to induce projects, including controls over zoning and the ability to create special tax financing districts. The Department of City Development is one of the most powerful -- and largest -- departments at City Hall. We turned to Bill Drew for a little insight. Drew is director of the Milwaukee County Research Park on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. In the past, he served as commissioner of city development and also was director of administration for a time at the county, under former County Executive F. Thomas Ament’s administration. (He has contributed $1,000 to Walker’s gubernatorial campaign). What role should the county play? "The county has struggled to come up with an answer," Drew said. "We’ve been in and out of that business in one way or another since the early ’90s." The situation is exacerbated by fighting between the board and the executive. "It’s the culture of the institution that is causing a problem," Drew said. The board and executive have to agree "on the same vision and make a commitment that’s longer than one year." Drew said there hasn’t been a professional economic development specialist at the county since Tim Casey, now economic development coordinator in Brookfield, held the post in the 1990s. Under Walker, two of his recent selections to lead economic development efforts -- Bob Dennik and Tim Russell -- came from his campaign organization and didn’t last long. While Barrett’s claim is very specific -- on whether the department was eliminated -- it aims to make a broader point: That Walker has not done what he could have done when it comes to jobs. So we will delve a little deeper into how the position has been handled. After the battle over reinstating the office in 2010, Walker could have filled the position starting in January. In August, he hired Damon Dorsey. There was no official announcement of the hiring. It did not become public until it appeared on a County Board committee agenda. Most recently, Dorsey had worked for the administration of outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle on a proposed $810 million high-speed rail connection -- opposed by Walker -- between Milwaukee and Madison. He made $25 an hour, or $52,200 a year, to assist getting communities involved along the rail line. In the county job, he will make $80,500 a year. Dorsey is the former leader of the North Avenue Community Development Corp., which developed several apartment and retail buildings in the central city. In 2007, he developed a commercial building at N. 37th St. and W. North Ave. for a custard and burger stand called Scoopz that was publicly financed in part by the Milwaukee Economic Development Corp. and state Department of Commerce. The business closed after less than a year, and Dorsey and his wife, Maria, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2009. That case has since been closed. As part of the bankruptcy, Dorsey was required to take a personal financial management class, a routine hurdle required by federal law. Dorsey said the Scoopz experience shows that he understands the challenges facing businesses in this economic climate. "I’ve been on the front lines of the war," he said. "I’ve seen the blood." So, let’s return to the job -- and claim -- at hand. To draw a contrast on the critical issue of jobs, Tom Barrett says Scott Walker shut down his economic development office in the midst of a recession. The office did disappear, but in less than a year Walker was already trying to reinstate it -- though the County Board sliced back his plans. While the Barrett TV ad leaves the impression the county’s department was large, economic development has never been a major priority or function of the county. We rate Barrett’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04735	Says Sherrod Brown voted "for the $1.17 trillion health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/30/crossroads-gps/crossroad-gps-says-117-trillion-health-care-law-sh/	Crossroads GPS, the conservative political advocacy group created by Karl Rove, is one of the top spenders among the third-party organizations targeting Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his re-election battle with Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. A spin-off of the group American Crossroads, it has spent money most visibly on television ads attacking Brown's record. Among them is "Doing," a 30-second spot whose several claims include the assertion that Brown voted "for the 1.17 trillion dollar health care law that adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers." PolitiFact Ohio wondered particularly about a tax aimed at manufacturing. We asked Crossroads how it supports its cost and tax claim. Crossroads pointed to a July report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The report says that the insurance coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- the healthcare law commonly known as Obamacare -- contains added costs of $1.17 trillion from 2012 to 2022, confirming the figure in the ad. The cost figures only paint part of the picture, however. The CBO report, and the staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that the cost figures "do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits." When assessing the overall cost of the health care law, the CBO said it could actually reduce budget deficits, because of its provisions that reduce net outlays and because of provisions that increase federal revenues. Those offset the added costs, and then some. One of those provisions is a 2.3-percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Crossroads GPS cites that as the "new tax on Ohio manufacturers," and notes that the Joint Committee on Taxation says it will generate $20 billion in revenue by 2020. The tax does not apply to devices made for export, or to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids or other medical device "generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use," the law states. It applies to imported devices as well as those made domestically. In responding to our query, Crossroads GPS also pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs. An analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government, however, found that the trade group's study "is not credible." Bloomberg concluded that its assumptions conflict with economic research, overstate companies’ incentives to move jobs offshore, and ignore the positive effect of new demand created by the healthcare law. Crossroads GPS also cited an article in the Columbus Dispatch, "Medical-device makers fight tax," to show the tax's negative effects on jobs. But the same article notes that AdvaMed and industry officials "could not cite an example in Ohio of a company that has cut jobs or put growth plans on hold in anticipation of the tax." Where does that leave us? The ad's statement is partially accurate. The Crossroads ad puts an accurate figure on the 10-year net cost of the healthcare law. But the claim leaves out several important details. While there is a federal cost generated by the insurance requirements, overall the law would reduce federal deficits, according to the same reports that Crossroads cites. The law does include an excise tax on the sale of medical devices. Its impact is arguable. Dissenters say it could cost jobs and force business overseas. But portraying it broadly as "a new tax on Ohio manufacturers" over bills the scope of the tax. In Ohio, Crossroads said, about 20,000 workers are employed by makers of medical devices and equipment. Those jobs amout to about 3 percent of the more than 660,000 workers in Ohio that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says are employed in manufacturing. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-08-30T06:00:00	2012-08-15	['Ohio']
pomt-00821	"From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/27/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-gop-budget-does-not-ask-ultra-wealt/	If the Republicans’ proposed budget reduces the deficit, the country’s ultra-wealthy won’t have anything to do with it, said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Sanders, who is an Independent but caucuses with Democrats, tweeted a meme March 23 that said, "From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction." Both the House and the Senate have passed Republican budget proposals for Fiscal Year 2016, and they're working on reaching a final deal. We wondered if the 14 wealthiest Americans really had made $157 billion in just two years. and whether these individuals would contribute to deficit reduction under the budget proposal. The $157 billion The first part of Sanders’ claim is on point. His staff made the calculation using the Forbes 400 list, which tracks net wealth of the world’s richest people. We won’t recreate the whole list here, but the top-14 includes the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett and members of the Walton family, who founded Wal-Mart. One minor thing -- Sanders’ list accidentally left out Alice Walton, ranked No. 8, but included Google co-founder Sergey Brin, ranked No. 15. We calculated it both ways (with Walton and without Brin, and vice versa), and the difference was negligible, so we won’t take issue with that minor discrepancy. Forbes data shows that the 14 wealthiest Americans were collectively worth $450.3 billion in March 2013. As of March 2015, they are worth $607.4 billion. That’s a difference of $157.1 billion. The biggest leap was that of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who went from a net worth of $13.3 billion in 2013 to $33.4 billion today. That’s a $20.1 billion change. Does their wealth go untouched by the Republican budget? It’s really hard to say. The Republican budget The first question is whether the Republican budget proposals -- one out of the House, another out of the Senate -- reduce the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government research agency, says they would. In a recent report, CBO found that the Senate Republican proposal would reduce the deficit by $4.9 trillion over 10 years, compared to the baseline. (The baseline assumes current law continues without any change.) Another report found that the House Republican proposal -- which passed the chamber -- would reduce the deficit by $5.3 trillion over 10 years. In broad strokes, the proposals say they accomplish deficit reduction through a combination of spending cuts (such as repealing the Affordable Care Act) of about $5 trillion and closing tax loopholes. The proposals also say they will not raise taxes on anyone at any income level -- they assume that revenue over the next 10 years will be about what it is expected to be under current law. "Along with lower rates, we propose broadening the tax base by closing special interest loopholes that distort economic activity," the House proposal reads, without getting any more specific. There’s nothing in either the Senate or House proposal that specifically addresses the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy could, though, contribute to the deficit reduction by either paying more taxes or taking some sort of hit in the spending cuts. The problem here is that a federal budget resolution is not a line-item appropriation bill. Rather, it is a list of spending targets and policy priorities. To pass the spending outlined in the budget requires additional legislation. This means that we have no idea how different spending targets will be reached, nor do we know the specifics of the tax reforms. "The only thing budget resolutions really do is say how much or little we will be spending in each area of government," said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the nonpartisan think tank Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "From that perspective, no budget resolution can specifically ask anything from the wealthy for deficit reduction – it’s just not how they are designed," Goldwein added. We posed Sanders’ statement to the Senate Budget Committee staff, and they told us that it is up to the authorizing committees to determine how the spending cuts and tax reforms are enacted. So we don’t know who or what will specifically cause the deficit reduction. The CBO says outright that it cannot determine the effect on how the budget would impact individuals’ taxes without knowing the particulars. The top 1 percent of earners currently pay a median income tax rate of about 30 percent. But there’s nothing to suggest they would be contributing above and beyond current levels. A spokesman for the Democratic members of the Senate Budget Committee (which includes Sanders) told us that because the budgets don't increase revenue or taxes, the ultra-wealthy are not required to contribute to deficit reduction. The flip side of that coin is that no one at any income level is required to contribute extra to deficit reduction. It’s likely that broad-based spending cuts suggested in the proposals would likely have some sort of impact on individuals at every level of wealth, meaning even the ultra-wealthy would have to sacrifice something as part of Republicans’ plan to reduce the deficit, Goldwein added. But again, without knowing the specifics, it’s impossible to know with certainty. Curtis Dubay, a tax policy fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, pointed out an issue of words: Sanders’ claim talks about net wealth, when the government does not tax wealth directly (except for the estate tax) -- it taxes income. "It would be more germane if he cited how much income the richest Americans earned, but that would be a different list since income and wealth are different," Dubay said. Our ruling Sanders said, "From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction." The 14 richest Americans’ net wealth did go up by about $157 billion between 2013 and 2015. The proposed Republican budget does not ask anything specific of the ultra-wealthy. It does not raise taxes, but it says it intends to streamline the tax code. However, these are broad strokes -- not specific legislation. So we don’t know how lawmakers would specifically handle these proposals, and we don’t know how they would impact the ultra-wealthy. Sanders’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-12994	"If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/15/donald-trump/pants-fire-trump-tweet-about-russian-hacking-probe/	President-elect Donald Trump continues to question whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. Trump has said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone "sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds." And if it is the Russians, why did the White House wait so long to act? Trump asked on Twitter. "If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?" Trump tweeted early Dec. 15. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Only that’s not true. The administration announced its findings a month before Election Day, and the White House’s announcement prompted a memorable exchange at the final presidential debate. Who’s the puppet? On Oct. 7 — a few months after WikiLeaks released a trove of DNC emails, but the same day WikiLeaks released emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — President Barack Obama’s administration said it was confident Russia was behind the cyberattacks. "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations," read an Oct. 7 joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The U.S. Intelligence Community consists of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on the group’s behalf. Their statement said releases of alleged hacked emails on DCLeaks.com and Wikileaks and by the online persona Guccifer 2.0 were "consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts." "These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process," the statement said. "Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities." Clinton used the statement as ammo when she referred to Trump as Putin’s preferred "puppet" in the Oct. 19 presidential debate. ("No puppet, you’re the puppet," Trump replied.) When Clinton brought up the intelligence community’s statement, Trump said, "She has no idea whether it is Russia, China or anybody else." Post-election doubts After the election, Trump has been just as dismissive about Russian involvement. Regarding Russia’s involvement in the DNC email hack, Trump told Time magazine (which named him Person of the Year), "I don’t believe it. I don’t believe they interfered." On Dec. 12, Trump also questioned the timing of concerns about election-related hacks, tweeting, "Unless you catch ‘hackers’ in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?" Republican and Democratic leaders have raised concerns about Russia’s role in the election and have called for a congressional investigation. According to a New York Times investigation, Obama warned Putin about the cyberhacking and potential U.S. retaliation in person at the G-20 summit in China. The administration, however, chose to issue the joint written statement from Homeland Security and the national intelligence director rather than a more public rebuke from Obama. "It was far less dramatic than the president’s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony," the New York Times noted. Obama was aware of Russian hackers previously targeting the State Department, White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the New York Times reported, but he chose not to publicly call out Russians or issue sanctions out of "fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia’s cooperation in negotiations over Syria." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?" About a month before the Nov. 8 election, the Obama administration accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections, directing the release of emails "from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations." This didn’t happen under the radar. Trump was confronted with it at the final presidential debate.

pomt-08246	$65 million from ABC privatization will not pay for "even an overpass in Tysons Corner."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/13/richard-saslaw/richard-saslaw-says-65-million-abc-privitazation-w/	Virginia Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw hasn’t hidden his opposition to ABC privatization, scoffing at predictions that auctioning off retail liquor licenses will generate major money for state roads. After his first plan for total privatization stalled, Gov. Bob McDonnell is now exploring turning over only the the retail operation to the private sector. According to a Washington Post report, Saslaw recently told the Alexandria City Council that if auctioning off the retail licenses generated $300 million (close to the original plan’s estimate), Northern Virginia could see between $60 million to $65 million. That’s "not even an overpass in Tysons Corner," Saslaw reportedly said. Well, $65 million is more than couple cups of coffee, so we wondered if his claim was true. PolitiFact Virginia attempted unsuccessfully to reach Saslaw. Because we don’t know if he had a particular overpass in mind, we took a broad look at the cost of building one in Northern Virginia. Let’s start with the basics. Based on the cost of construction alone, Saslaw’s claim runs into trouble. Kendal Walus, the state bridge engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the most recent estimates to build a bridge in Virginia is $237 per square foot. Of the 65 bridges built last year, the average square footage was 22,400. That would make the cost for the average overpass about $5.3 million. But that figure doesn’t include the various other costs involved like engineering and land acquisition. And those vary. "There could be quite a bit of range depending on how complex the bridges are," said Eric Teitelman, chief of the projects and operations division of the Fairfax County Department of Transportation. "Of course, land cost can be a wild card in this whole thing. Tysons is a pretty expensive real estate area." Teitelman estimated the average cost of an overpass in Northern Virginia at between $35 million to $40 million excluding land acquisition, but said it could soar as high as $100 million with a high elevation flyover. "If you are talking just an overpass, not an interchange, $65 million should cover the construction cost," added John D. Lynch, an engineer with VDOT. "However, a lot depends on impacts of the new bridge. If significant right of way and/or utility impacts are realized, or impacts to existing businesses, these costs would escalate quickly." To get a better sense of normal costs, including land acquisition, we looked at a few projects underway and coming up in Northern Virginia. An interchange getting underway at Fairfax County Parkway and Fair Lakes Parkway, for example, is estimated to cost $69.5 million. But that includes two overpasses and three miles worth of road widening. So, if we cut that in half, a single overpass and some of the widening work would be close to $35 million. In nearby Manassas, a four-lane overpass underway at Route 28 and Wellington Road is estimated to cost $44 million. Plans to replace the Washington Boulevard Bridge over Columbia Pike in Arlington -- part of the Pentagon Roadway Network -- is estimated to cost just under $60 million. Summary Saslaw says that if Northern Virginia were to receive $60 million to $65 million it wouldn’t be enough to cover the cost of an overpass in Tysons Corner. Based on the officials we spoke with, it’s possible that a major interchange in Tysons Corner could cost that much or more, especially when the cost of land acquisition is included. But our interviews and most of the examples cited by the officials indicate that Saslaw’s estimate is on the high end. So we find his claim Barely True.

pomt-01830	"More than 50 percent of immigrants from (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) use at least one major welfare program once they get here."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/18/bill-oreilly/oreilly-says-over-half-immigrants-3-central-americ/	The crisis at the border brought on by thousands of young people seeking entry, some with a parent and many without, has fueled an immigration debate that was already overheated. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly took the government’s ad hoc measures to stanch the influx and deal with those who are already here as proof of a broader problem with immigrants from Central America, particularly those from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. "Our welfare system is strained to the limit now, so is the public school system," O’Reilly said on his July 8, 2014, show The O’Reilly Factor. "About 50 percent of them lack a high school education. And more than 50 percent of immigrants from those three countries use at least one major welfare program once they get here. So the Obama administration is allowing millions of people to come in without the skills to compete in the marketplace. That is creating an underclass." A reader asked us to dig into the claim that more than 50 percent of the people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use at least one welfare program. We asked O’Reilly’s show for the sources behind that statement and did not hear back. But a little before his program, the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower immigration levels, released a fact sheet with the numbers O’Reilly used. "57 percent of households headed by immigrants from El Salvador use at least one major welfare program, as do 54 percent of Honduran households, and 49 percent of Guatemalan immigrant households. Among native households it is 24 percent," the fact sheet said. The publication relied on Census Bureau data, which counted "welfare" programs as including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP), Medicaid, free and reduced school lunches, Supplemental Security Income (SSI is for poor elderly, blind or disabled people), housing aid, and the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) food assistance program. We should note that several of those welfare-type programs are not available to people living here without permission -- including food stamps, TANF, housing subsidies, non-emergency Medicaid and SSI. The fact sheet made no distinction in the legal status of immigrants, nor did O’Reilly. That aside, immigration researchers we reached said the statistics presented by the Center for Immigration Studies and repeated by O’Reilly are reasonably accurate. Giovanni Peri, a professor of economics at the University California-Davis, said, "the Center for Immigration Studies probably did it correctly from Current Population Statistics data." Another economist, Marianne Bitler at the University of California-Irvine, agreed. "My guess is that their analysis is accurate for the family units they describe," Bitler said. That said, there are a couple of caveats researchers said are worth mentioning. Bitler noted how programs that help children could cause an entire household to be included in the tally. The Census, Bitler said, "measures whether anyone in the household is getting SNAP, but not whether all residents are getting it. Similarly, I imagine a lot of the Medicaid use they capture is by children." Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, gave an example of how this could play out. "Suppose there is a family where the father is a Central American legal immigrant, a small business owner," Ku said. "The wife is a U.S.-born citizen and their two children are U.S.-born citizens. One young child gets Medicaid or CHIP (health insurance for children), another gets school lunch and that is the only assistance they get. The whole household is now considered an ‘immigrant welfare user.’ " The result: a higher percentage. Steven Camarota, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies fact sheet, defends his approach. "It makes sense to calculate welfare by household because eligibility for most programs is based on household income," Camarota said. Another caveat: This difference in how people coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use welfare programs depends on the specific program. Camarota himself noted in a 2012 study that immigrants use cash welfare programs -- TANF, SSI and state cash payments -- at about the same rate as people who were born here. "Use of cash tends to be quite similar for immigrant and native households," Camarota wrote. "If by ‘welfare’ one only means cash assistance programs, then immigrant use is roughly the same as that of natives." The numbers in that analysis showed 5.4 percent of U.S. natives received such aid, compared to 7.4 percent of Guatemalans, 5.3 percent of Hondurans and 5 percent of Salvadorans. The gap substantially widens, however, when you include food aid (which included food stamps and free-reduced school lunches) and health care. Our ruling O’Reilly said that more than 50 percent of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras use at least one welfare program. That’s correct when looking at households and use a broad definition of "welfare," experts told us. But looking at individuals would produce a different, lower percentage. Also, there is a wide disparity depending on what particular welfare program you’re looking at. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-09293	"By the end of Governor Rick Perry's term, he will have drained Texas taxpayers ... of more than $360,000 to pay for the rental mansion he has been living in while the historic Governor's Mansion is repaired."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/24/bill-white/white-says-perrys-rental-home-will-cost-taxpayers-/	With the state facing a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White recently aired advice to GOP Gov. Rick Perry on how to save the state some money: Move. In fall 2007, the state rented a home for the governor and his wife, Anita, about 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin so the Governor's Mansion could be renovated. In an April 13 press release, White, who faces Perry in November, calls the monthly rent an "extravagant, unwarranted use of taxpayer dollars," adding that by the end of his current term, Perry "will have drained Texas taxpayers ... of more than $360,000 to pay for the rental mansion he has been living in while the historic Governor's Mansion is repaired and renovated." White then calls on Perry to "set a budget-cutting example for other state employees and move out." We wondered whether White's right about how much Perry's rented pad will cost taxpayers. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, pointed us to a column in the Houston Chronicle that mentioned the monthly rent of the 4,600-square-foot home and to an earlier PolitiFact Texas item, in which we rated as Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that Perry "lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month." The lease for the house at 8113 Hickory Creek Drive, which last year was appraised by the Travis Central Appraisal District at $1.1 million, was initially for one year starting Oct. 1, 2007. The rent was set at $9,900. Less than a year after the Perrys moved into the rental home in a gated community near Barton Creek, the Governor's Mansion, just southwest of the Capitol, was heavily damaged in an arson fire for which no one has been arrested. Work has stopped on the mansion pending a decision on options for rebuilding the historical structure. In fall 2008, the lease on the rental home was renewed through October 2011 with the rent lowered to $9,000. Through this April, the state has paid $290,700 in rent. Toss in the eight months left in Perry's current term -- as White does -- and the total rental payments come to $362,700. So, does White get the tab for Perry's rented digs right? Yes -- and that's not counting other housing-related expenses. The state has not responded to requests for information on the costs of security at the governor's home-away-from-mansion. However, $197,000 has been spent on utilities and other items, such as preparing the rental residence for the governor, according to the Texas Facilities Commission and State Preservation Board. While we don't have an exact comparison of the ancillary costs of living at the Governor's Mansion, we know that in 2007 -- the last year that Perry lived there -- those bills, including for grounds work and utilities, totaled more than $330,000. (Kay Molina, assistant executive director of the Facilities Commission, said high maintenance costs that year reflected the fact that the mansion needed to be renovated.) Regardless, White nails the expected rent costs for the Perrys to reside in suburban Austin. We rate White's statement as True.

pomt-02786	"By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/05/barack-obama/obama-says-children-low-income-families-hear-30-mi/	Words, words, words. President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His recent speech on economic issues, in which he backed a minimum wage increase, included more than 6,500. But what about a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap affects young children? "By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she’s already behind," he said. Just for comparison’s sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches. But did he get his fact right? We’d never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to research from the mid 1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley. They published their findings in a book, Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children. Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language. They found a 30 million "word gap" by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That’s one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the "achievement gap," a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing. The word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She’s also the director of Thirty Million Words Initiative, one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research. "This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life," Suskind said. Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it’s "pretty well-accepted" as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately. Suskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there’s variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don’t. "No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed," she said. "You can’t generalize economic groups." Our ruling Obama said that less-affluent children are behind by the time they start school because they have heard about 30 million fewer words than peers from higher-income families. Experts say studies clearly support Obama’s point. We rate Obama’s statement True. Editor's note: This item was edited after initial publication to clarify that researchers studied the word gap of children up to age 3, not age 5.

pomt-08539	"Perry pushed for a law that lets insurance companies raise homeowners’ rates without having to justify the increase."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/03/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-pushed-law-let/	Political group Back to Basics' latest television ad criticizing Gov. Rick Perry suggests that the Republican leader has used his office to help insurance companies boost their bottom lines. The ad says: "Perry pushed for a law that lets insurance companies raise homeowners’ rates without having to justify the increase." The TV spot is the fourth to be aired by Back to Basics, which also has run a newspaper ad calling Perry a coward for not debating his Democratic opponent Bill White and for declining to meet with newspaper editorial boards. We wondered if Perry helped allow insurance companies to boost homeowners' rates "without having to justify the increase." Before gauging his role, we looked at the law and how it came about. Back in 2002, insurance rates being charged Texas homeowners were making headlines. The American-Statesman reported that October that Texas was "in the grip of an insurance crisis," characterized by rising premiums for homeowners and reduced coverage for water and mold damage. The article reported that consumer advocates and legislators agreed that the root cause of the crisis was "the state's failure to act as the insurance industry effectively deregulated itself during the past 20 years, moving all but 5 percent of its policies to subsidiaries whose rates are not under state control." At the time, "state control" referred to the "benchmark" system, which required insurance companies to charge rates within a specified range set by the insurance commissioner. If a company wanted to charge higher or lower rates, it first had to get approval from the Texas Department of Insurance. The 2003 legislative session saw the passage of Senate Bill 14, which Perry signed into law; it switched Texas to a "file-and-use" system bringing all insurers back under state regulation. The result: A company can file its rates with the Texas Department of Insurance and start charging them right away, although most set the effective date at some time in the future. On a website providing backup information for the insurance ad, Back to Basics points to a report from consumer advocacy group Texas Watch that describes the switch as "a major overhaul of the property and casualty insurance market in Texas." The key sentence: "Under the file-and-use system, insurers must simply inform (the Insurance Department) of any rates that it intends to charge, then may begin immediately charging that rate." At the Texas Department of Insurance, though, spokesman Jerry Hagins disputed the idea that insurers can raise — or lower — rates without justification. Hagins explained the process this way: Rate filings are reviewed by department actuaries, who may ask the companies for more information. If the new rates are found to be "excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory," the department can block them from going into effect. If that finding is made after the rates are already being charged, the department can order the company to rescind them, and give refunds, plus interest, to customers who paid premiums based on the rejected rates. But there's a catch. If a company challenges the department's finding, the new rates "may continue to be used during the appeal process until the dispute is resolved," Hagins said. However, Hagins said rate filings rarely get to that stage. Also rare, he said, are filings of rate increases that are effective immediately, leaving no time for staff review. He added that the department often pushes back against proposed rate changes during informal communications with a company before it actually files. We looked at Insurance Department rate-filing data since 2003 for the largest eight companies writing homeowner policies in Texas and found about 15 filings that sought to increase rates within a week; seven were initially scheduled to go into effect the same day. At least nine rate filings have been "rejected" or "disapproved" since 2003. The vast majority of filings — more than 180 — are what Hagins described as "overall revenue neutral," which he said "means that the statewide average impact is zero; some consumers might see an increase while others would see a decrease." Hagins also warned that the rejection numbers don't show how frequently the department pushes back against proposed rate changes during its communications with companies before a rate is officially filed, leading companies to adjust their plans. Has "file and use" helped consumers? According to a July 20, 2008, story in the American-Statesman, that question is "hotly debated. Both Democratic and Republican legislators ... said they were frustrated that 'file and use' had not led to significant rate decreases for Texans." We aren't going to get into that here. So much for how "file and use" works. Does the law spell out that companies must "justify" their rates before raising them? Beaman Floyd, director of an insurance special interest group, the Texas Coalition for Affordable Insurance Solutions, pointed to a section of the Insurance Code titled "Rate Filings and Supporting Information," which specifies two materials — "applicable rating manuals" and "supplementary rating information" — that insurers "shall file." Those materials include a variety of backup information that companies use to determine rates. Requiring more information from a company is up to the insurance commissioner, who can make rules specifying what is needed. When we asked about that, Hagins pointed us to a section in the Texas Administrative Code requiring insurers to submit a two-page form and a memorandum that speaks to the overall impact of the rate filing. The rule says the memo may include "reasons for changing rates." But Alex Winslow, executive director of Texas Watch, said the critical issue in justifying rates is when it happens in the filing process. "In a nutshell, is any sort of justification meaningful if the justification takes place after consumers are already forced to pay an excessive rate?" For an outside perspective, we contacted Bob Klein, a professor at Georgia State University who is also director of the Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research. He disagreed with Back to Basics' description of a file-and-use system, saying that "a company still has to justify a rate increase." He said that based on his observation of the way the system works in Texas, the state lets companies know if they are not "comfortable" with the filing and typically, the company withdraws it. Texas "does not have the reputation of being an easy state to get rate increases approved," he said. Finally, we looked into whether Perry pushed for the "file and use" bill that is now the law, as Back to Basics says. Perry was among many elected officials calling for homeowner insurance reform before the 2003 legislative session. According to his prepared remarks for a Feb. 12, 2002, news conference, Perry said he had asked the insurance commissioner to work with legislators "to examine additional state regulations, legislative remedies and tort reforms to put the brakes on runaway homeowner's insurance costs." One option, Perry said then, was a file-and-use system. "A tougher option is a prior approval rating system," he added, which "would require the insurance commissioner to approve or disapprove certain rate increases before customers are asked to pay." Prior approval was preferred by consumer advocacy groups and many Democrats, but did not find favor in the 2003 legislative session. In a December 2002 press release declaring his intention to designate homeowners insurance an emergency issue for the upcoming legislative session, Perry mentioned several reform proposals, although he did not specify any regulatory system. After the session began in January, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Perry had not yet "thrown his weight" behind any of the insurance-related bills that had been filed. Far as we can tell, he never did. When Perry signed the insurance legislation into law, his prepared remarks said it required rates to "be fair, reasonable and justified. If future rates are unfair, the Department of Insurance now has the authority in law to reject excessive rates out of hand and force insurance companies to offer lower rates." Among the legislators Perry thanked for their work on the legislation were Sens. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, and Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, architects of the insurance overhaul. We asked the two senators if Perry pushed for the file-and-use approach. Jackson said in a statement that Perry had no direct involvement with the proposal as it advanced. Fraser's office shared a November 2002 news article describing Perry as neither endorsing nor criticizing their approach. Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said that "the governor's office pushed for reform of the system, but not a particular regulatory structure." Cliff Walker, director of Back to Basics PAC, told us that a Feb. 22, 2002, press release issued by Perry's office proves the governor backed file and use because it mentions that system as a "legislative option." But the release also mentions the possibility of a "prior approval" system. Summing up: The Back to Basics claim is based on the notion that Perry was instrumental in pushing the file-and-use system. That’s not supported by news reports or other evidence. In addition, the suggestion that insurance companies need not justify homeowners’ rate increases is off base: That’s part of the information they’re asked to submit with their filings, and it plays a role in the back-and-forth that may ensue with the department’s staff. We rate the statement False.	None	Back to Basics	None	None	None	2010-10-03T06:00:00	2010-09-08	['None']
pomt-05049	"Every one of the 67 supervisors of elections" in Florida refused to carry out the effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls.	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/10/moveon/moveon-says-florida-election-supervisors-refuse-pa/	MoveOn.org has been hitting the TV with ads in English and Spanish and emailing supporters to bash the state’s effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. "Republican Governor Rick Scott tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls in his state and is now suing the Department of Justice after they stepped in to stop him," MoveOn wrote in a June 27 email. "Rick Scott's racist voter purge—which directly targets Latino voters—is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—has so far refused to carry it out." In this fact-check we will explore whether all Florida supervisors of elections refused to carry out the noncitizen voter purge. In a related fact-check, we’ll look at whether Scott "tried to kick 180,000 people off the voter rolls" and include more background on the history of the purge. The origins of the list Scott’s quest to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls began shortly after the governor took office in 2011. He asked the state’s chief elections official at the time, Kurt Browning, to look into whether noncitizens were illegally voting. Two departments, the Florida Department of State and the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, compiled a list comparing voter registration information with drivers’ license data. It’s possible for a noncitizen to get a drivers’ license, but it’s illegal for a noncitizen to vote. So the agencies looked for noncitizen drivers to see if they had also registered to vote. There’s a catch there, though: The drivers’ license data is not updated when people become citizens, at least not until they need to renew their licenses. The state found 180,000 names that they considered potential noncitizens. But the state government itself does not have the power to remove people from the voting rolls -- that power lies with the local supervisors of elections. It’s important to note here that the state did not send all 180,000 names to the local supervisors. Instead, the state identified a much smaller subset of 2,600 potential noncitizens and sent those names to the local supervisors in April. So Scott was not trying to remove 180,000 names, and we rated that claim False. (Read the full fact-check.) The state gave supervisors a sample letter to send to the registered voters asking for proof of citizenship. If the voters failed to comply, state law indicated they would be removed from the voter rolls within one or two months. The largest contingent came from Miami-Dade County, which has a high foreign-born population. Democrats questioned the motives and timing of a Republican governor months before a presidential election. Republican leaders pointed out that it’s a felony for noncitizens to vote. A Miami Herald analysis determined that there were more Democrats than Republicans on the list and that about 58 percent were Hispanic. Flaws found in the counties It didn’t take long for supervisors to find flaws on the list and air grievances at their statewide annual conference in mid May. "It just doesn't seem to be consistent with the thing we always preach, which is uniformity. I'm feeling really uncomfortable about this," Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes told state officials, according to the Palm Beach Post. When the supervisors and journalists started looking into the list, they found some people who were clearly eligible to vote. A few examples: Manoly Castro-Williamson was one of 13 potential noncitizen voters on the list for Pasco County. She was born in Ohio, is a registered Republican and has voted in every election in Florida since 2004. In Broward County, Democrat and Brooklyn-born Bill Internicola (who fought in World War II) was shocked to find himself on the list. The U.S. Department of Justice ordered the state to halt its noncitizen purge on May 31. The next day, the attorney for the statewide supervisors’ association recommended that counties halt the project. Statewide, more than 100 ineligible voters were removed before the purge came to a halt, according to the Secretary of State Ken Detzner. "Initially almost all of us (county election supervisors) started out complying with that request," said Vicki Davis, president of the statewide association of election supervisors and the supervisor in Martin County. But nearly all counties stopped in June amid concerns raised by the DOJ, the association’s own attorney and supervisors’ concerns about flaws in the list. We checked in with several counties to see if they refused to comply with the state’s direction after receiving the list of names in early April. We found that Davis’ summary was accurate: Of the counties we contacted, most sent letters to voters on the list and removed those who confirmed they were not citizens. But most of the counties we contacted didn’t remove the individuals who never replied and halted the process in June amid concerns about the legal fights and accuracy of the list. Here are the specific responses of the counties we contacted. We have included the party affiliation of the supervisors although some are elected to a nonpartisan position. Miami-Dade: Of the 1,637 names, 554 provided proof of citizenship and an additional 30 said they would send that proof as soon as possible. Supervisor Penelope Townsley, who is registered as no-party affiliation, decided on May 31 not to remove any voters other than those 14 who admitted they were ineligible. Townsley told state officials in a letter that the list for Miami-Dade had an error rate between 31 and 33 percent based on their research and "may be potentially higher." Broward: The county received a list of 259 names. Seven responded that they were citizens, and six were removed after reporting that they were not citizens. Supervisor Brenda Snipes, a Democrat, did not remove the remainder who didn’t respond. Snipes halted the purge in early June after the advice from the association attorney. Palm Beach: Palm Beach received 115 names from the state but never sent the voters letters or removed any, because Supervisor Susan Bucher said that the drivers license information was outdated. (Bucher is a Democrat but her position is nonpartisan.) Pinellas: The county received 36 names from the state. It stopped processing the names on June 1 and reactivated 15 who had been canceled from the voter file after not responding. One man was removed from the voter roll because he confirmed he is not a U.S. citizen. Supervisor Deborah Clark, a Republican, announced that she was halting the process June 1 due to concerns about the reliability of the data. Hillsborough: The county received a list of 72 names. Six individuals provided documents verifying their U.S. citizenship. The office contacted one person by telephone who had voted about 42 times, and he said that he was a naturalized citizen. Around May 18, supervisor Earl Lennard, a Republican, decided to stop any action unless his office received reliable information, according to the supervisor’s chief of staff. The county removed one voter who verified that he was not a U.S. citizen. Pasco: Pasco County sent letters to 13 individuals -- two provided birth certificate copies and two asked to be removed. The county didn’t hear from the remainder. The county forwarded one name on the list -- a Canadian who never voted -- to the state attorney for review. The remaining nine were not removed because Supervisor Brian Corley, a Republican, told PolitiFact that he lacked "clear and credible evidence to proceed with removal." However, these voters have been flagged, and if they show up to vote, a member of Pasco’s supervisor of elections management team will speak with the voter and advise them that if they are not citizens, it is a felony to vote. "We complied with the law -- there was not a preponderance of the evidence," Corley told PolitiFact in a telephone interview. "If I could get credible information, I would move forward tomorrow." Collier and Lee: These two Southwest Florida counties accounted for about 1.5 percent of the 2,600-name list, but they are noteworthy because they continued the process of removing names after the DOJ got involved. Both counties had done a separate search for noncitizens, prompted by a TV report earlier in the year that compared voter rolls with prospective jurors excused from jury duty because they were not citizens. Lee removed 11 who didn’t respond. Collier removed seven who indicated in writing or on the phone that they were not citizens, plus two who indicated on their registration application that they were not citizens. Collier also removed nine who signed for their letter and didn’t respond and eight who still didn’t respond after a published notice. One person who provided proof of citizenship remained on the rolls. Lee County Supervisor Sharon Harrington is a Republican, but the position is nonpartisan. Collier County Supervisor Jennifer Edwards is a Republican. We contacted MoveOn and told them the results of our investigation. MoveOn spokesman Nick Berning told PolitiFact in an email: "Though election officials may have originally complied with the order, the language in our e-mail was intended to convey to our members the important point that none of the 67 officials are willing to carry out the purge." Our ruling MoveOn.org wrote that "Rick Scott's racist voter purge—which directly targets Latino voters—is so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the state—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—has so far refused to carry it out." Actually, many supervisors began to carry out the state directive to verify the citizenship of some voters, starting in April and continuing for several weeks. We only found one county -- Palm Beach -- that never contacted voters on the list at all. (We contacted about eight counties and the statewide association.) Ultimately, the Justice Department and supervisors themselves raised concerns about the list. It was at this point that many supervisors halted the purge. We also found at least two counties that did, in fact, carry out Scott's plan. So we rate the statement False.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2012-07-10T16:04:03	2012-06-27	['None']
pomt-03387	Says under the Senate immigration bill, newly legalized immigrants will "pay every tax possible, but you don’t get a single benefit" for 10 years.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/08/luis-gutierrez/senate-bill-says-undocumented-immigr/	The effort to pass a sweeping immigration law has shifted to the Republican controlled U.S. House of Representatives where it faces a much tougher challenge than it did in the Senate. Supporters say that any hope for success lies in compromise. House Republican leaders say the Senate bill falls short in significant ways, but Democrats argue that it already contains major concessions. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a long-time advocate for immigration reform from Chicago, highlighted how much his side was willing to give up to get the Senate bill through. "They said to immigrants, 11 million of them, they said, tell you what we're going to do: For 10 years, you pay every tax possible, but you don't get a single benefit," Gutierrez said on CNN’s State of the Union. Gutierrez gave some examples: Immigrants with provisional legal status would not get help paying their health insurance premiums under Obamacare, and they would get no credit for any Social Security taxes they paid during the time they worked illegally. In this fact-check, we explore the terms of the deal in the Senate bill. Are they as stark as Gutierrez presents, or is the picture more complicated? Gutierrez’s staff clarified that he was using shorthand to refer to means-tested federal benefits.That would include some of the country’s largest programs such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF or welfare), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps). What the Senate bill says The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act allows immigrants without documents to get permission to live and work in the country legally. The Social Security Administration expects that nearly three-fourths of the estimated 11.5 million people here will qualify for what is called Registered Provisional Immigrant, status, or RPI. A smaller number of agricultural workers would qualify for a separate program called the blue card. Neither program grants citizenship or permanent legal status, but they provide a pathway to both. Applicants would need to pay a fine, a fee, and pass a criminal background check to qualify for provisional status. The bill has a specific provision that goes to Gutierrez’s claim. For both RPI and blue card holders, it says, "An alien who has been granted blue card (or RPI) status is not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit" and to be clear about what those benefits are, the bill refers to a law passed about 15 years ago. In 1996, Congress defined the public benefits that undocumented immigrants couldn’t get. That law listed "Any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit." Numerous agencies have interpreted this to mean Medicaid and Medicare, SNAP, energy assistance and so forth. The Senate bill also expressly blocks immigrants with temporary status from receiving any health insurance premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, individuals can use their own money to buy their insurance through the clearinghouses called exchanges. "Rep. Gutierrez is broadly correct, but not 100 percent," said Leighton Ku, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University who analyzed immigrant use of public benefits in a paper for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "If they are poor enough and meet other eligibility criteria, for example, if they are a child or a low-income parent, RPIs may be eligible for emergency Medicaid, as are unauthorized immigrants." The 1996 law built in some exceptions for immigrants without legal documents. In addition to Medicaid paying for emergency medical treatment, young children are eligible for reduced school lunch programs and standard immunizations. The Women, Infant and Children program, WIC, can subsidize grocery bills for young families. So for children, women who are pregnant or have recently delivered, and medical emergencies, current law allows benefits for the undocumented and the Senate bill does not change that. Lastly, on the tax side, the Senate bill says "an alien may not file an application for registered provisional immigrant status ... unless the applicant has satisfied any applicable Federal tax liability." In other words, these provisional residents must pay Uncle Sam. Regarding the 10 years Gutierrez mentioned, some immigrants under provisional status might be eligible for permanent resident status, a green card, sooner. If that happens, then they would gain access to public benefits in less than 10 years. However, both Social Security and Medicare require that a person or their spouse pay into the system for 10 years before they can claim any benefits. This applies to everyone, native born or not. And both programs are available only to citizens or permanent residents. People with provisional status would have Social Security and Medicare taxes deducted from their paychecks but would be ineligible to use those programs for 10 years. A dispute over benefits The U.S. Code defines public benefits, but there are some who say the list is incomplete. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors limited immigration, said the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit provide aid to lower income workers through the tax code. A working family that owes no taxes and meets other criteria can apply and receive thousands of dollars from the government. "Gutierrez is mistaken," Camarota said. "These large programs are explicitly available to those in RPI status. Low income immigrants typically work and have children, so their use rates of these two programs are very high, as it will be for RPI folks." Immigration reform advocates agree that provisional residents would gain from the tax credits. But Tanya Broder, senior staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, counters that blocking their use of these credits would be a first for the tax code. "Individuals granted RPI status are required to pay the same taxes and are subject to the same deductions from their income as all other taxpayers," Broder said. "Denying them the ability to claim the EITC would create an unprecedented two-tiered tax system for lawfully present workers." Regarding the accuracy of Gutierrez’s statement, he was using the federal definition of benefits, and while lawmakers could decide otherwise, we take current law as our guide. For many years, Camarota and others have noted that the children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States are deemed citizens and are eligible for benefits. Their family members could indirectly benefit. The Senate bill makes no change in that. Our ruling Gutierrez said that immigrants with provisional status would pay every tax and get no benefits. His staff said he was talking about means-tested benefits, and to a large extent, Gutierrez was in line with what the Senate immigration bill says. It requires unauthorized immigrants to pay taxes, and so long as they are in a provisional status, they would not be eligible for food, housing or medical assistance. There are exceptions under current law that would allow them to get some public benefits, but these are limited and in any event, the Senate bill does not change the status quo. A subset of immigrants, children brought to the country at a young age and agricultural workers, would be eligible for green cards in less than 10 years, but the majority, about 70 percent, would have to wait the full time.

pomt-02956	In Florida, "300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-florida-300000-people-are-going-l/	Recent letters to 300,000 Floridians from Florida Blue, a division of Blue Cross Blue Shield, have injected new vigor into claims that the health care law means consumers will lose their insurance. "The issue of Obamacare is about a much broader agenda to inject more government control over our lives and over our economy," said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Fox’s The O’Reilly Factor. "On this very day in Florida, it was announced that 300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance. They are going to owe the IRS money in the form of a fine. Where are they supposed to go now and buy that health insurance if the website isn’t working, if Consumer Reports is telling people to avoid the website?" Rubio’s concerns about the website referred to healthcare.gov, the federal government’s online marketplace for health insurance. The website has been plagued with problems and hasn’t been functioning properly since its debut on Oct. 1. Rubio made his claim during a week when the announcement by Florida Blue affecting 300,000 policy holders received much attention. (U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made similar statements related to Florida Blue.) We asked Rubio's office for evidence to support his claim. "This is pretty simple," said Rubio's spokesman Alex Conant in an email to PolitiFact Florida. "Question: can any one of the 300,000 people keep their current health plan? Answer: No." We decided to check Rubio’s claim: Are 300,000 people going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare? And will they face the consequences Rubio suggests? Florida Blue’s letters On Oct. 21, Kaiser Health News reported that health plans were sending hundreds of thousands of cancellation letters to people who buy their own coverage. We found the news repeated by several news outlets and blogs, with headlines such as this one in the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog: "Who’s to blame for the 300,000 policy purge? Florida Blue or Obamacare or both?" In response to the news coverage, Florida Blue issued a statement: "The Affordable Care Act mandates that all health insurance coverage packages provide 10 categories of essential health benefits. Because some plans offered by all insurers did not include all of these new services, they will no longer be available. Approximately 300,000 current Florida Blue members are enrolled in plans that will not meet these new benefit requirements. "Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them. Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014. "It is important to note that a person’s individual situation will be the key driver of what they will pay for coverage under the ACA. Subsidies will be available in the marketplace to lower the cost of coverage for eligible individuals, and the amount an individual will pay could vary significantly once his or her specific age, area in which they live, smoking status, family size, and income are factored in." The Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network obtained copies of letters received by Florida Blue consumers. The letters stated that due to the Affordable Care Act, the consumer’s particular plan "will be closed" and recommended another Florida Blue plan. "To help ensure that you have continuous health care coverage, you’ll be enrolled in this health plan effective Jan. 1, 2014, unless we hear from you by Nov. 1, 2013." The letters stated that consumers could choose a different Florida Blue plan. "We’ll help you find a plan that’s right for you," the letter stated. A spokesman for Florida Blue, Mark Wright, told PolitiFact Florida that when it comes to getting new plans, "nobody is throwing anybody off a cliff." Not everyone’s policies expires on Jan. 1, those expirations will happen throughout the year. Consumers have to be notified that they have to choose a new plan 90 days before their plan expires. Jon Urbanek, a senior vice president at Florida Blue, told us the company intends to offer people with expiring policies a range of options. Depending on where they live and other factors, "most people will have a choice of somewhere around 40 plans to choose from," Urbanek said. Health care experts We sent Rubio’s statement to a few health care experts to see if they thought it was accurate. What we generally heard was that while policy holders are losing that particular insurance plan, they do have other options. "There is some truth to saying that they are losing their coverage plans they are now in -- they are no longer available," said Timothy Jost, a law professor at William and Lee and co-author of the casebook Health Law. "Presumably those are plans with very high deductibles, high out-of-pocket costs." However, "it is also inaccurate saying people are losing coverage." Christopher J. Conover, a health research scholar at Duke University and adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact Florida that these consumers are losing their current health plan. "Most of your readers might interpret ‘losing coverage’ as meaning these individuals will become uninsured. Some in fact will be, but not the majority....," he said. Conover said that the same situation is happening to millions of consumers nationwide. "This eventually will touch millions of Americans," he told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Rubio said, "300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance." Rubio was referring to letters Florida Blue started sending to consumers in the individual market in August. The letters do tell consumers that their particular plan will end due to the Affordable Care Act. That’s because the plans typically don’t offer the comprehensive coverage that is required under the new law. However, the letters also state that consumers will have "continuous health care coverage" and assigned them a particular plan, or gave them the option to contact Florida Blue and choose another plan. So their coverage is not dependent on being able to buy insurance through healthcare.gov, the government’s online marketplace. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07814	Americans, in the last 30 years, "have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education) … and the results have gotten worse, not better."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/17/michelle-rhee/michelle-rhee-tells-florida-legislators-spending-e/	Florida legislators last week fawned over former Washington, D.C., public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee as she addressed House and Senate members. Today, PolitiFact Florida offers its most sincere form of admiration: We put Rhee in front of the Truth-O-Meter. Rhee -- who was recently featured on Oprah, appeared on the cover of Newsweek and in the documentary film Waiting for Superman -- came to Tallahassee Feb. 8-9, 2011, to help craft Florida education policy. The Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott want to revive proposals to end tenure for teachers and tie teacher pay to student performance, both measures Rhee supports. During her remarks, Rhee also at least tacitly defended Scott's proposals to cut public education funding as part of his budget proposals for 2011-12 and 2012-13. "Money does not necessarily correlate with student achievement," Rhee said. "In this country in the last 30 years, we have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child…and the results have gotten worse, not better." Rhee says education spending and student results are moving opposite directions. Is she right? Per-pupil spending Let's first look at U.S. education spending. Education spending statistics are tracked by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. The center has collected and analyzed per-pupil spending since 1919, tracking both the actual per-pupil investment as well as normalizing the expenditures based on the rate of inflation. That allows folks like Rhee, and us, to use the research as a method of comparison. The most recent calculations are from 2006-2007 and show that the expenditure per pupil enrolled in the fall amounts to $11,674. That is significantly more than what the United States spent per pupil 30 years earlier, when governments spent the equivalent of $6,037 per student. Rhee is slightly off when she says "more than doubled," but not by much. Per-student elementary and secondary school education spending -- when adjusted for inflation -- increased 93 percent from 1976 to 2006. For the record, Florida officials say the state spends about $6,900 per student currently. Scott is proposing to shrink per-student funding to about $6,200. What's been the payback? What the country has gotten for that investment -- especially over a 30-year period -- is much more difficult to determine because there are few uniform rankings to consider. We first tried to compare the United States education system to other countries in the world. The United States and Europe began discussing a way to measure worldwide academic progress in the 1960s. But the talks produced a series of tests measuring different-aged students in different subjects. And none of them appear to be acceptable ways to measure educational progress over 30 years. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study measures trends in reading literacy achievement of fourth-grade students. But the test has been administered only in 2001 and 2006. A third test is scheduled for 2011. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study has been around since 1995. And the Programme for International Student Assessment measures 15-year-olds, but wasn't administered until 2000. The National Center on Education and the Economy tried to normalize the assessments in 2005 by analyzing results from 1995-2003 in math, reading and science. The United States did not make the top 10 countries in any category. The most recent PISA results, from 2009, were even more sobering. In reading literacy, 15-year-old American students were average performers and the U.S. showed little improvement in reading since 2000. Overall, the U.S. ranked 14th. In math, U.S. 15-year-olds ranked 25th, below average. In science, 17th. Education Secretary Arne Duncan pointed out that funding wasn't the problem that had American students lagging -- noting that students in Estonia and Poland perform at roughly the same level as those in the U.S., even though Estonia and Poland spend less than half as much per student. "The hard truth is that other high-performing nations have passed us by during the last two decades," Duncan said on Dec. 7, 2010, after the PISA results were announced. "In a highly competitive knowledge economy, maintaining the educational status quo means America's students are effectively losing ground." One more troubling statistic. According again to the National Center on Education and the Economy, the United States graduated a higher percentage of its working age adults from high school in the 1970s than any other country in the world. Today, a handful of other countries now best the United States, and many other countries are quickly catching up. Yet what's critical to note is that none of those statistics explicitly mean American students are performing worse, especially over a period of three decades. They simply mean that students in some other countries are improving more rapidly than U.S. students. Andreas Schleicher, a senior education official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, testified before a U.S. Senate committee that Americans were losing the advantages they gained by massively increasing education enrollments after World War II. "Two generations ago, South Korea had the economic output of Afghanistan today and was at rank 24 in terms of educational output among today's OECD countries," Schleicher said. "Today it is the top performer in terms of the proportion of successful school leavers, with 96 percent of an age cohort obtaining a high school degree. Similar trends are visible in college education, where the U.S. slipped between 1995 and 2005 from rank 2 to rank 14, not because U.S. college graduation rates declined, but because they rose so much faster in many OECD countries." Without 30 years of data to analyze education systems around the world, we next looked for ways to compare solely U.S. student performance. Turns out we had better luck. One of the best strings of data comes from the Department of Education's National Assessment of Educational Progress, an assessment authorized by Congress, which measures U.S. students in reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, civics, geography and other subjects. Reading scores are available for 9-, 13- and 17-year-old students periodically starting in 1971. The first of 11 assessments in math began in 1973. In that span -- from 1971-2008 -- how have U.S. students performed on the test? Contrary to what Rhee has suggested, at every age level and in both math and reading, students have improved. In reading, average scores were 12 points higher than in 1971 for 9-year-olds and four points higher for 13-year-olds. The average score for 17-year-olds improved, but was not significantly different compared to 1971. In math, it's the same story. Average scores were 24 points higher than in 1973 for 9-year-olds and 15 points higher for 13-year-olds. The average score for 17-year-olds was higher, though not significantly different than in 1973, according to NAEP results. Looking on a trend line, the results show slight to modest gains for students both in reading and mathematics. That's comparing the American students of 30 years ago to the American students of today. We contacted Rhee's schools group, Students First, but did not hear back. Our ruling During her trip to Florida, Rhee said that Americans, in the last 30 years, "have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education) … and the results have gotten worse, not better." Per-pupil education spending has grown significantly over the past 30 years, and the United States spends among the most to educate its K-12 students. But to say that student results have gotten worse is simplifying things a bit. Maybe the return for the increased spending isn't what people want, but student performance in math and reading has improved slightly over the past 30 years, according to statistics kept by the U.S. Department of Education. Different assessments essentially show that U.S. students have failed to make the gains that other countries have. But they haven't showed U.S. students performing worse. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Michelle Rhee	None	None	None	2011-02-17T09:35:11	2011-02-09	['None']
pomt-04525	Almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses involved just 78 suspects, an indication that the same people are panhandling over and over.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/02/michael-julian-bond/atlanta-councilman-targets-repeat-panhandling-offe/	In many metropolitan areas, panhandling has long been a problem for local officials looking to balance a positive city experience for tourists with humanely treating their less fortunate residents. The two agendas came together in the city of Atlanta last week when the mayor and the City Council collaborated on a problem-solving plan aimed at aggressive panhandling. They agreed to define and strengthen the city’s rules against that type of solicitation and set jail time of 30 and 90 days for repeat convictions. The plan followed an initial proposal, sponsored by Councilman Michael Julian Bond, that would have allowed up to 180 days in jail for a conviction. "The sentence should act as a deterrent," Bond, chairman of the council’s Public Safety Committee and the ordinance sponsor, said in an article by the Atlanta Business Chronicle about the initial amendment, which the council approved Sept. 17 but the mayor vetoed. During the Sept. 17 council meeting, the Business Chronicle wrote that Bond cited statistics showing that almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses involved just 78 suspects, an indication that the same people were panhandling over and over. With so many arrests, we questioned whether such a small number of people could be responsible for all the offenses. What data did Bond use to make the statement, and was the recidivist claim truly indicative of Atlanta’s aggressive panhandling problem? Bond made a similar claim in an August 9, 2012, guest column he penned for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. At that time, Bond wrote, "[S]ince last July, Atlanta police officers have made 279 aggressive panhandling arrests. Seventy-eight people were responsible for over 200 of these arrests — which mean some 75 percent of aggressive panhandling violations are due to less than 80 individuals." Atlanta’s new ordinance expands the definition of aggressive solicitation by prohibiting someone from continuing to ask for money after he or she has been told "no." It also prohibits touching during panhandling. A second conviction for aggressive panhandling requires the violator to serve a minimum of 30 days in jail; a third violation merits 90 days in jail. We checked with Bond’s office about the source for its statistics. The numbers used in the statements were taken from two sources: the Atlanta Department of Corrections and the Municipal Court of Atlanta. Bond’s staff narrowed the court data of arrests between 2005 and July 2012 for panhandling-related offenses. Using just arrests from July 2011 through July 2012, staff then hand-counted the offenses and repeat offenders. The challenge in evaluating the claim comes with Atlanta’s current laws. As it stands, Atlanta does not have a specific aggressive panhandling ordinance. It does have a commercial solicitation ordinance, but no one has been arrested or prosecuted under it since it was passed in 2005. Instead, most aggressive panhandlers had been charged with begging/solicitation by accosting/force, according to police. For its analysis, Bond’s office primarily used data on the begging/solicitation by accosting/force charge. Using that data does produce the statistics Bond cited. But because Bond did not specify in his statement which panhandling-related offenses he included, the analysis could change based on the data handler and the offenses selected. The court provided Bond’s office with data about a half-dozen charges that could reflect solicitation or aggressive panhandling. Overall, Bond’s analysis of the recidivist problem of aggressive panhandling is legitimate, according to experts who have studied the issue. "These are the types of numbers that we are seeing," said Michael Scott, director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, a community issue problem-solving think tank based at the University of Wisconsin Law School. His organization did a similar study of chronic nuisance offenders in Madison, Wis., and found the same phenomenon. "It’s a small percentage of people that are the chronic problems, and it’s also notable that many of these people are not homeless but seem to be professional panhandlers," Scott said. "… It’s a relatively small number of people that are creating the most problems for police, local officials and passers-by." So, is Atlanta Councilman Bond correct in his statement that 78 offenders were responsible for almost 400 arrests in the city last year for panhandling-related offenses? His assessment of the repeat offender aggressive panhandling problem appears accurate. But the varying charges that can make up panhandling-related offenses are not uniform and can change based on the situation. By using certain sets of public safety data, the statement can be correct, but shifting the range of offenses can change the numbers. Because of this possibility, we rate Bond’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05188	Citizens Property Insurance has "over $500 billion worth of risk, with less than $10 billion worth of surplus."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jun/13/rick-scott/rick-scott-said-citizens-has-500-billion-risk-expo/	It’s become Gov. Rick Scott’s favorite talking point in the escalating debate over raising rates at Citizens Property Insurance: The state-run insurer has a whopping $500 billion in risk exposure, and a paltry $6 billion in surplus, or cash-on-hand. In interviews, at Cabinet meetings and even in a pop-quiz-styled survey to the Florida Council of 100, Scott repeatedly uses these two numbers to illustrate the financial health of Citizens. "I’m not sure how much smaller Citizens can get. But here’s the position Citizens is in now," Scott said during a May trip to the Florida Keys. "They have over $500 billion worth of risk, with less than $10 billion worth of surplus. So that’s a lot of risk, and I think one of the most important things homeowners want is if there ever is a disaster that their insurance company is going to be able to pay the bill." In a survey given to the Florida Council of 100 last month, Scott got more specific, stating that the state-run insurer had $504.8 billion in total risk exposure and only $6.1 billion in cash surplus. It’s a jarring numerical juxtaposition used to show that Citizens is severely undercapitalized and, if a major hurricane hits, would spur untold financial calamity for the state. Fearing so-called "hurricane taxes," Scott asked the Citizens board of governors to find ways to drastically reduce the company’s size and exposure late last year. (Citizens currently has issued about 1.4 million policies.) The board came up with more than 30 proposals, most of which would lead to increased rates or reduced coverage for policyholders. To justify those painful rate hikes, proponents point to the weak financial position of Citizens, often comparing its cash on hand to its maximum exposure. A growing chorus of critics say Scott and insurance industry insiders are using exaggerated, apocalyptic language to incite fear and justify large increases on insurance premiums. The numbers are extreme, to say the least. After six years without a single hurricane hitting Florida, could Citizens’ finances really be that frightful? We did a little digging and found that Scott’s statements about Citizens’ financial assets and liabilities, while technically true, omit major components of the financial structure of Citizens. First, on the side of Citizens’ "surplus." The state-run insurer does, indeed, have nearly $6 billion in cash reserves, money it has been able to build up during the last six hurricane-free years. But that cash— the most Citizens has ever had--is only part of the pot the insurer uses to pay hurricane claims. Few, if any, property insurers rely solely on cash surplus to pay claims in the wake of catastrophe. Citizens, like every other licensed property insurer in Florida, has backup insurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. It also has private reinsurance worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Finally, Citizens has the ability to sell bonds to pay the cover claims that exceed its surplus and reinsurance coverage. Altogether, Citizens has about $19.5 billion in claims-paying ability, more than three times the amount cited by the governor. Most of that could be paid out before any assessments, or "hurricane taxes" would be required from non-Citizens policyholders. The other half of Scott’s statement mentions that Citizens has $500 billion in total exposure to risk. This is also true, but it has little to do with whether Citizens "is going to be able to pay the bill" after a storm. What would it take for Florida to actually have to pay out $500 billion in claims? A superstorm 25 times as ferocious as Hurricane Andrew would have to hit South Florida, and zigzag its way through Florida’s peninsula, hitting all 67 counties and damaging or destroying every home and business with a Citizens policy. A series of back-to-back, Andrew-sized storms up and down the state could also do the trick. In the absence of such an apocalyptic occurrence, a more realistic estimate of maximum losses would be the 1-in-100-year storm, the so-called "Big One," that would cause more damage than Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Estimates indicate that kind of storm -- which only has a 1-percent chance of occurring in a given year -- would cost Citizens a maximum of $21 billion. This number, while large and financially troublesome for Citizens, is nowhere near the $500 billion often repeated by the governor. Scott spokesman Lane Wright said regardless of which numbers are presented, the fact that Citizens remains in a precarious financial position is central. "No matter how you slice it, in the worst case storm, the one-in-100-year storm, Citizens still falls short of being able to pay its claims," Wright said, adding that Florida could also get hit with several back-to-back storms. "That’s a fact." That’s true -- but those aren’t the words Scott has been using. He’s opted for the gasp-inducing $6-billion-versus-$500-billion language. Our ruling Scott has said repeatedly that Citizens has more than $500 billion worth of risk, but about $6 billion in cash surplus. But the $500-billion number vastly overstates what Citizens might have to pay in even the most vicious storm season imaginable. And the $6-billion figure undercounts Citizens’ ability to pay claims. So those numbers are not the appropriate figures to use when determining whether the insurer "is going to be able to pay the bill" after a storm. More appropriate numbers would compare Citizens’ total claims-paying ability (about $19.5 billion) to the damage caused by a once-in-a-century kind of hurricane (about $21 billion). Scott’s statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-06-13T11:03:30	2012-05-08	['None']
pomt-01727	In the "do-nothing Senate," there are 352 House bills "sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action," including 55 introduced by Democrats.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/06/lynn-jenkins/rep-lynn-jenkins-blames-harry-reid-do-nothing-sena/	Members of Congress recently decamped to their home districts for the August recess, but the never-ending partisan skirmishing on Capitol Hill continues. Many readers told us they saw references on social media to a comment by Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan., about House-passed bills dying on the doorstep of the Senate. They asked us to take a closer look, so we did. Here’s the full text of Jenkins’ comments, made at a press conference on July 29, 2014, as the final week of the congressional session was winding down: "The president is fond of referring to the House as the ‘do-nothing Congress.’ But we have 352 reasons why it’s a ‘do-Nothing Senate.’ "352 bills are sitting on Harry Reid’s desk, awaiting action. "98 percent of them passed with bipartisan support -- Republicans and Democrats working together to pass legislation. "50 percent of the bills passed unanimously, with no opposition. "70 percent of the bills passed with two-thirds support in the House. "And over 55 bills were introduced by Democrats. "352 bills. Why won’t Harry Reid act? These are good bills; bills that put the American people back to work, put more money in hardworking Americans pockets, help with education, and skills training. We call upon Harry Reid to get to work before he adjourns in August to pass some of these bills. The American people deserve better." Jenkins offered a lot of statistics in a short statement, so to keep this fact-check manageable, we’ll focus on her claim that in the "do-nothing Senate," there are 352 House bills "sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action," including 55 introduced by Democrats. Have 352 bills passed the House but await action in the Senate? Basically, yes. We used the THOMAS congressional database to pluck out the 733 measures that have passed the House so far this year. We then weeded out a few categories of bills -- ones that, for procedural reasons, were never intended to go to the Senate (such as election of the Speaker, assignment of lawmakers to committees, and procedural motions) or ones that were subsequently taken up by the Senate (either being passed or rejected). What remained were 342 individual bills. That’s 10 fewer than what Jenkins claimed, but we have no quarrel with her number, since the difference likely stems from additional bills being passed in the couple of days between when she spoke and when we looked through the database. Are these bills "sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action"? Resolving this claim is murkier. First, a technical problem. It’s an oversimplification to say that these bills are "sitting on Harry Reid’s desk." Many have been assigned to committees, where they would need to be approved before being taken up on the floor. While Reid has influence over what committee chairs do, a chair can -- using their own powers -- decide to either fast-track or stall a bill coming over from the House. Another complication: In at least some cases, the Senate is working on a bill on the same topic, but without using the House bill as a starting point. "The disposition of a House bill is not particularly relevant to measuring Senate legislative activity," said Steven Smith, political scientist and Senate specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. We should also note that in the Senate, one member -- either from the majority or the minority -- can stop a bill in its tracks by threatening to filibuster -- a delay that requires 60 votes to break. Reasonable people can disagree about whether Reid or Senate Republicans are the biggest offenders -- we previously addressed some of those issues -- but the experts we checked with said both parties share at least some of the blame. "There's plenty of blame to go around," said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican House aide now studying Congress at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Wolfensberger sees Reid as the bigger offender by blocking bills and amendments "to protect his vulnerable members who are up for re-election in November. You can blame the threat of filibusters and politically sensitive amendments from Republicans, but politics ain't bean bag. Senators were sent there to cast the tough votes, not to be pampered, protected and coddled by their leaders." Others see Republican threats as the bigger problem. "It is true that some bills, including some of substance, are being blocked by Reid from action because he wants to avoid Republican amendments of the ‘gotcha’ variety that could work against some of his endangered incumbents up this fall," said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "You can make a case that the role of the majority is to suck it up and do votes, even if some are uncomfortable. But on the balance sheet, the bigger reality is that very few of the bills passed by the House were aimed at compromise or agreement with the Senate." A spokesman for Jenkins, Thomas W. Brandt, told PolitiFact, "Only Sen. Reid can bring these bills up for a vote, and if he did, it would go a long way in ending the legislative gridlock currently plaguing Washington." Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, countered by noting that there are 50 bipartisan Senate-passed bills awaiting House action. (Here's the list.) Do the House-passed, Senate-stalled bills include 55 introduced by Democrats? On the number, Jenkins is basically right -- we counted 54. But if this statistic is intended to communicate how generously the House treats its minority caucus, Jenkins’ talking point is somewhat overblown. Unlike the Senate, where the minority party and individual lawmakers hold notable leverage, the House is structured -- regardless of which party is in power -- as a tyranny of the majority. Whoever has the most votes and holds the Speaker’s gavel determines which bills get considered, and precisely how they get considered. Minority-party preferences are granted, if at all, as a favor from the majority. The number of Democratic-sponsored bills Jenkins mentions -- 55 -- accounts for just 16 percent of all House-passed bills now awaiting consideration in the Senate. But even that figure is misleadingly high. When we took a closer look at the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills that passed the House, we found that fewer than half -- 24 -- could reasonably be described as substantive. And many of these were the kinds of measures lawmakers would be hard-pressed to vote against -- for instance, the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013, the Homes for Heroes Act of 2013, the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2014, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act and the Human Trafficking Prevention Act. The remainder of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills -- a majority -- aren’t exactly the most high-profile measures pending in Congress. Thirteen were technical changes to local federal lands; five approved honorific names for postal or other buildings; four addressed federal studies or advisory committees; three were bills sponsored by a non-voting territorial delegate; three concerned narrow technical corrections to existing legislation; one concerned U.S. coinage; and one was a private bill granting an immigrant visa to an individual. So House bipartisanship lives, but let’s not oversell it. Why the numbers don’t tell the whole story Experts say this bill counting merits a grain of salt. As the breakdown of the 55 Democratic-sponsored bills suggests, many of the measures that pass the House -- and some that go on to pass the Senate -- are noncontroversial bills. Wolfensberger crunched the numbers for us and found that of the 570 bills and joint resolutions that have passed the House in the current Congress, 377, or 74 percent, originated as suspension bills -- a streamlined process used for non-controversial measures that requires two-thirds approval. And of the 142 measures signed into law by Obama, 118, or 83 percent, were approved by that same two-thirds requirement. Meanwhile, many of the other bills that pass the House in today’s environment are bills that are intended to make a statement, not a law. Ornstein contrasted bills that are "designed to lay the predicate for action via compromise" or consensus, which are declining, and those "designed for show or as a political statement, where there is neither intention nor expectation that the other house will act on them." Where substantive, contentious legislation is concerned, the odds of passage are poor. One example is the Senate-passed (and bipartisan) immigration bill, which remains stuck in the House. Another sign is the fact that the Senate has not yet passed any of the 12 annual appropriations bills -- even though the House has passed seven and the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved eight. By contrast, the second category of "show" bills includes dozens of full or partial repeals of the Affordable Care Act passed by the Republican House. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said a fundamental reality of today's political landscape is that "the two chambers' majorities have different agendas and priorities and different ideas of what constitutes a 'problem.' And even when the parties agree on the need to address an issue, their prescriptions differ. That complicates the legislative process, and in the current period of high partisanship, it seems most often to bring the legislative process to a halt." Our ruling Jenkins said that in the "do-nothing Senate," there are 352 House bills "sitting on Harry Reid’s desk awaiting action," including 55 introduced by Democrats. In some cases, committee chairs -- not Reid -- may be blocking or moving slowly on these bills. In other cases, senators are working on their own alternative bills on the same topic. Meanwhile, the claim oversells the degree of bipartisanship in the House; a majority of the Democratic-sponsored bills she cites are relatively minor pieces of legislation. Ultimately, Jenkins places all the blame on the Democrats and the Senate, but experts agree that it takes two to tango. Both parties and chambers have played a role in creating the current legislative dysfunction. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05069	Says Clackamas County Measure 3-401 "will hurt our county, cripple economic growth, and increase our taxes with excessive special elections."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/05/clackamas-county-democrats/will-passage-light-rail-ballot-measure-clackamas-c/	Clackamas County residents will vote Sept. 18 on a measure that, if approved, will require county officials to get voter approval before spending county resources for "financing, design, construction, or operation of any public rail transit system." Yes, that means MAX. Conservatives tend to back Measure 3-401 as a way to hip-check county commissioners who make spending decisions. In response, Clackamas County Democrats issued a statement saying they would fight the measure. The statement was published in the letters section of the Clackamas Review. Democrats argue that passage will stymie economic development, throttle local government and cost taxpayers money. Actually, it’s more than just costing more money -- the claim is that the measure will increase taxes: "Let’s be very clear on 3-401. Its passage will hurt our county, cripple economic growth, and increase our taxes with excessive special elections. A ‘no’ vote is sensible and reasonable." Who wants higher taxes for more elections? Nobody, right? Or was this just a scare tactic by Democrats? PolitiFact Oregon recalled a similar argument when a similar issue was on the ballot in Clackamas County last year. Supporters of one urban renewal ballot measure tried to scare voters away from a competing ballot measure by arguing that countywide elections would cost "a fortune" compared with geographically limited elections. We ruled that statement False because adding a voter question to a primary or general election doesn’t really cost the elections division extra. We acknowledge that this is a different situation. If voters approve Measure 3-401, future questions about light-rail related decisions will need to go to voters during any one of four authorized regular elections every year. Again, it doesn’t cost much money, if anything, to add a question to a primary or general election. But it will cost money if it’s the only issue on a ballot -- and the election is held just to address that one question. Want an example? Measure 3-401 is the only issue on the Sept. 18 ballot. Steve Kindred, county elections manager, estimates the election could cost around $125,000. That’s real money. But the claim is that the ballot measure will "increase our taxes with excessive special elections." Will it? The answer is no. There is no special tax for elections. County residents pay property taxes, which grow at a predetermined rate, and the money pays for various county agencies, including elections. Kindred checked with staff and said nobody there can recall a time when the tax base was raised to cover the cost of additional elections. Just to be on the super safe side, we checked with the county assessor, Bob Vroman. He, too, said that more elections do not translate into higher taxes. Before we rule, we should include what the spokesman for the Clackamas County Democrats said when we put the tax-raising question to him. Remember, this is a statement that went to media outlets and elected officials. It was published in the Clackamas Review. "Special elections cost money, that’s all it means," said Peter Toll. He added, "The county is compelled to run an election at our expense. It’s going to cost tax money." Well, then. So much for precision in language, or even giving voters accurate information. Approving Measure 3-401 will not increase taxes. Elections cost taxpayer money, but the election may have been held anyway. Taxes in Clackamas County will go up, but for reasons outside the frequency of elections. We rule the statement False.

pomt-07068	"Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks (on rail targets). Four thousand people have died. Thousands of injuries."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/28/frank-lautenberg/us-sen-frank-lautenberg-claims-rail-targets-have-c/	Soon after Osama Bin Laden was killed in early May at a compound in Pakistan, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg said the intelligence gathered there was a wake-up call about terrorist threats against America’s rail network. But in a more recent interview, the senator derailed slightly when stating the number of attacks on rail targets since 2004. A day after conducting a committee hearing on threats to rail security, Lautenberg (D-NJ) was asked by a reporter for ABC’s Top Line about whether Congress would seriously deal with rail security. Lautenberg said Congress was "not really paying the kind of attention that … it needs. Since 2004, there have been some 1,300 attacks. Four thousand people have died. Thousands of injuries, and how can we ignore that when these areas are susceptible to terrorist inclinations?" Given that the interview was about how Congress would deal with rail security, it sounded like Lautenberg was saying there had been about 1,300 attacks on trains in America over the last seven years. Could that be right? Lautenberg spokeswoman Gail Ribas told PolitiFact New Jersey that the senator was referring to "the number of worldwide attacks on rail." She said Lautenberg’s statistics came from the California-based Mineta Transportation Institute, which was created by Congress in 1991. We knew the senator’s numbers were off when we received the following data from Brian Michael Jenkins, an authority on terrorism at the Mineta Institute and director of the National Transportation Security Center of Excellence: Between January 2004 and May 22, 2011, there were 717 attacks worldwide on railway tracks, bridges and tunnels; passenger trains; passenger train stations; and freight trains or stations. Those attacks caused 1,073 deaths and 5,641 injuries. The Mineta Institute statistics don’t include incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Asked about the discrepancy over the figures, Caley Gray, Lautenberg’s communications director, said Ribas made a mistake and that Lautenberg was referring to the Mineta Institute’s research on bus and rail attacks worldwide since 2004. When attacks on buses and bus stations or stops are added, Lautenberg’s statement about "1,300 attacks" is accurate, but the senator is still off on the number of fatalities. According to Jenkins, 1,295 attacks occurred on those bus and rail targets combined since 2004, causing 2,886 deaths. If we look at bus and rail attacks between Sept. 11, 2001 and May 22, 2011, the number of fatalities climbs to 3,858, which is closer to Lautenberg’s estimate. Gray told PolitiFact New Jersey that the senator’s statement excluded incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an emailed statement, Gray said: "The Senator used data about mass transit, which includes train and bus attacks. The fact is, we know our mass transit network is a tempting target for terrorists, and we have to stay vigilant and provide the resources to protect it." Here’s the problem: Lautenberg might have meant to say bus and rail attacks worldwide, but there was no mention of buses during the ABC interview. The senator also didn’t specify that these attacks occurred across the world. The entire discussion was about "rail security" and what U.S. officials were doing about it, leaving viewers with the impression that the senator was solely referring to rail attacks in America. But Lautenberg’s overall point during the interview is on target -- there is an ongoing threat of terrorism against rail systems. At that committee hearing -- where Lautenberg led the meeting -- experts testified that rail networks remain a target for terrorism, particularly because of the open nature of how they’re structured. Mia Bloom, a fellow at the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email that since New Jersey doesn’t have a metro system, trains are a more viable target. "I think many people on rail in the U.S. are not expecting an attack and thus without scanners and X-rays and other security measures, from a terrorists' perspective, rail is more (of) a low hanging fruit," Bloom wrote in the email. Back to Lautenberg’s statement, let’s review: During an interview about "rail security," Lautenberg said about 1,300 attacks had occurred since 2004, killing 4,000 people. But the senator never specified -- as his representatives would later clarify -- that he was referring to bus and rail attacks worldwide. When we look at rail attacks, the actual number of attacks is 717. If bus attacks are factored in, the senator is right about the number of total attacks, but still off on the number of fatalities. Lautenberg’s larger point about the terrorist threat against rail systems may be correct, but because of the various mistakes he made in presenting attack statistics, we rate the senator’s claim Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13926	The Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-slept-through-be/	Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton slept through the Benghazi attack, missing the proverbial 3 a.m. phone call. In a June 22 speech, Trump said Clinton’s decisions as secretary of state "spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims was our late Ambassador Chris Stevens. I mean what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. That’s right. When the phone rang, as per the commercial, at 3:00 in the morning, Hillary Clinton was sleeping." Trump has made this claim before. Was Clinton really asleep in her bed Sept. 11, 2012, while terrorists killed four Americans in the Libyan city of Benghazi? No. The, attack took place at about 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, or 3:30 in the afternoon Washington time on a Tuesday. Clinton was at her State Department office. None of the numerous congressional investigations into the attacks have faulted Clinton for her actions as the attacks unfolded that day or said she could have done something different on Sept. 12 that would have saved lives. For her part, Clinton has said in her memoir Hard Choices and in congressional testimony that she worked late into the night and did not sleep, though she did work from her Washington home for at least part of the night. We cannot independently confirm what she did that night, but we do know she released a public statement after 10 p.m. and emailed her daughter, Chelsea, after 11 p.m. The military, not the State Department, was in charge of responding to the attacks as they unfolded. At that time, the military had a limited presence in North Africa, but congressional investigations concluded that it did the best it could on the night of the attack with the resources available. "Given the military’s preparations on Sept. 11, 2012, majority members have not yet discerned any response alternatives that could have likely changed the outcome of the Benghazi attack," found the House Armed Services Committee in a 2014 report. That report and another by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that no outside parties — such as the State Department or the White House — hindered the military nor the intelligence community in their immediate defensive response to the attacks as they unfolded. For a while after the attack, some Republican members of Congress claimed an official — some speculated Clinton — told military or intelligence personnel to "stand down" while the attack occurred. The movie 13 Hours dramatizing the attacks perpetuates this rumor. But there is no evidence that anyone, much less Clinton, told personnel to "stand down," and at least two of the investigative reports conclude definitively that no one gave such an order. It is generally understood that the State Department failed to adequately secure the Benghazi diplomatic compound, despite awareness of a deteriorating security situation in the region. These failings made the compound vulnerable to attack and unable to effectively defend itself. What role Clinton played in addressing these security issues prior to the attack taking place is in dispute. Some Republicans have claimed that Clinton personally denied or ignored requests for security from diplomats in Benghazi, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. We and other fact-checkers have highlighted the fact there is no unequivocal proof that Clinton personally, deliberately, ignored security requests. An internal State Department review concluded that the security failings resulted from bureaucratic confusion and made specific recommendations to prevent a repeat of the Benghazi attack. Clinton has accepted ultimate responsibility for the attack, as the head of the State Department at the time, though she has said administrators below her were responsible for making specific security decisions. Our ruling Trump said the Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed." Clinton was not literally sleeping when the Benghazi attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon on a Tuesday in Washington. She worked late into the night, as is evidenced by an 11 p.m. email. If we take Trump’s claim more broadly, that Clinton was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred, none of the many congressional investigations into Benghazi have made that assertion. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20e94ed4-c29c-4a79-a2ae-c64e6d84093a	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-23T13:44:22	2016-06-22	['None']
pomt-06113	Enacting the Right-to-Carry Act would amount to "expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.’’	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/01/david-cicilline/rep-david-cicilline-says-right-carry-act-would-exp/	U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and former mayor of Providence, has joined current mayors of cities around the country to fight a gun-permit bill pending in Congress. The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., would require all states to recognize out-of-state permits for carrying concealed weapons. The House approved the bill 272 to 154 on Nov. 16, 2011. Cicilline and Rep. James Langevin, also a Democrat from Rhode Island, both voted against it. The bill is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2009.) Federal law restricts who can own or possess a firearm, and bans possession by anyone convicted of a felony. But the rules for getting a permit to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state. Nine states, including Rhode Island, don’t recognize out-of-state gun permits, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns. In a Nov. 18 fundraising letter e-mailed to constituents, Cicilline attacked Republicans and "Tea Partiers" for supporting the Right-to-Carry bill. "Earlier this week, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- with the enthusiastic support of Sarah Palin, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Partiers -- once again turned their backs on the 14 million unemployed Americans in our country," the letter says, "and instead chose to focus their efforts on expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines." Sex offenders? Terrorists? Child predators and abusers? "I told you: you wouldn’t believe it," the letter continues. Actually, we weren’t sure what to believe. So we decided to check it out. The facts We focused on the second part of the statement: "expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.’’ The phrase "expanding the rights’’ suggests that these criminals currently have the right to carry concealed weapons. But do they? Cicilline and his staff offered numerous examples, both hypothetical and real, to argue that, under the bill, criminals in each of the four categories could legally carry a concealed firearm into a state such as Rhode Island, which would amount to "expanding their rights." We checked what they offered and will summarize our findings, looking at the categories separately. Domestic abusers Under federal law, anyone convicted of a crime of domestic violence, including misdemeanors, or anyone subject to a court restraining order cannot legally own or possess a firearm. Cicilline’s staff provided us with information from Mayors Against Illegal Guns about four cases (in Missouri, Idaho, Florida and Pennsylvania) in which domestic abusers were granted concealed weapon permits and went on to commit murder. In three of the cases (those from Florida, Idaho and Missouri), authorities failed to enforce the federal law banning domestic abusers from possessing weapons, according to the summaries provided. In none of those cases did the abusers have the right to carry concealed weapons. So the Right-to-Carry Act can’t expand a right they don’t have. But in the Pennsylvania case, our research confirmed that the killer was granted a concealed weapons permit, despite a prior restraining order for domestic abuse. There were nothing to prohibit the state from granting the permit because the restraining order had been withdrawn. So in the domestic abuse category, one of the four examples that Cicilline’s staff provided -- the Pennsylvania case -- supports his claim that some people with a record of domestic abuse can legally carry a concealed weapon. Child predators Adults who sexually prey on children are prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony. And sex crimes against children are almost always felonies. But the term "child predator," Cicilline’s staff said in a follow-up e-mail, speaks more broadly about crimes that "lead up to or are related to child molestation.’’ misdemeanor They referred us to laws regarding sex-crimes against minors in states such as Florida, Georgia and New Hampshire, where there are no laws preventing such criminals from getting concealed weapon permits. We believe that some of the examples Cicilline’s staff provided, including a Georgia law that makes unwanted sexual touching of a 16-year-old a misdemeanor, stretch the meaning of the term "child predator." But in New Hampshire, an adult who lures a child into engaging in sex for pornography -- a misdemeanor in that state -- is clearly a child predator. So that example met the test. Sex offenders Federal law prohibits sex offenders convicted of felonies from owning or possessing firearms. But Cicilline’s staff noted that someone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense involving another adult would not automatically be barred from getting a concealed weapon permit in some states. In New Hampshire, for example, it’s a misdemeanor for correctional officers to engage in sex with someone over whom they have authority. Ann Rice, a New Hampshire deputy attorney general, said conviction for such a crime would not automatically bar someone from getting a concealed weapon permit. In this category, we verified that the type of case cited by Cicilline’s staff supports his statement. Terrorists Federal law bars anyone arrested, charged or convicted of acts of terrorism from owning or possessing a firearm. The Right-to-Carry bill clearly would not expand their rights. But Cicilline and his staff offered a broader definition of "terrorist" to support the congressman’s claim. They said people convicted under state terrorism laws, adopted in several cases after the Sept. 11 attacks, and people on the federal government’s terrorist watchlist could be considered "terrorists" or "suspected terrorists." (In his fundraising letter, Cicilline uses the terms interchangeably, twice referencing "terrorists" and once "suspected terrorists." In the statement we checked, he said "terrorists.") First, let’s look at the state "terrorism" laws. Examples provided by Cicilline’s staff include a "terroristic threatening" statute in Kentucky that makes it a third-degree misdemeanor to threaten to seriously injure someone or to cause substantial property damage. We confirmed that someone convicted of "terroristic threatening" in Kentucky could, indeed, be eligible for a concealed weapon permit after three years. Florida has a similar statute, though it’s never prosecuted anyone under it. But are they "terrorists" as one would commonly understand the term? We don’t think so. Now, let’s consider people on the terrorist watchlist. During a conference call, Cicilline said there are "thousands of people engaging in terrorism" who have never been convicted of any act of terrorism or other offenses that would disqualify them from possessing a firearm. And in states with lax gun permitting laws, he said, these "terrorists" can and do get concealed weapons permits So, if the Right-to-Carry bill becomes law, he reasons, they could legally bring their concealed weapons into Rhode Island. In addition, Cicilline and his staff referred us to a May 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office citing FBI data that showed that individuals on the watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 1,228 times from 2004 through 2010. The GAO found that 91 percent of those transactions were allowed to proceed because no felony convictions or other disqualifying factors were found. The GAO expressed concerns that "there was no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing a firearm or explosive because the person’s name appeared on the terrorist watchlist," Eileen R. Larence, director, Homeland Security and Justice at the GAO, said in an e-mail. But being on the terrorist watchlist isn’t the same as being a terrorist. It turns out there were more than 400,000 unique names and over 1 million entries on the terrorist watchlist at the end of 2009, according to The Washington Post. The list at one time mistakenly included the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, whose name was later removed. So, under the Right-to-Carry Act, it’s possible that people on the terrorism watchlist could legally carry a concealed weapon in states where they currently cannot. Does that mean that the rights of "terrorists" would be expanded? Again, no because they are not necessarily terrorists. What about Cicilline’s argument that, for the purposes of determining who has the "right" to a carry a concealed weapon, there is no real distinction between a terrorist and a "suspected terrorist"? We believe there is a distinction. Otherwise, the more than 400,000 people named on the terrorist watchlist in 2009 could have been considered terrorists. (It’s worth noting that among the more than half-dozen cases of shootings Cicilline’s staff provided to back up his claims, none involved a state legally granting a concealed weapons permit to a convicted terrorist, or to someone who, at the time, was a terrorism suspect.) In this category, we concluded that the examples cited by Cicilline’s staff were based on an overly broad definition of "terrorist" and did not support his claim. Our ruling Cicilline said the Right-to-Carry bill would expand rights of "sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines." In three categories -- sex offenders, child predators and abusers -- we agreed that in some narrow exceptions involving misdemeanor crimes, his statement was true. But we found that his statement didn’t meet the test on the fourth. To apply the "terrorist" label to all 400,000 people on the government’s watchlist, or to those convicted of a misdemeanor "terroristic" threat, is, at best, an exaggeration. Further, by saying the Republicans "chose to focus their efforts" on expanding the gun rights of "sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers," he implied, with a heavy dose of hyperbole, that this was their intent. Because the statement "is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rule it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06548	On running for the presidency in 2012	no flip	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-confirms-he-wont-seek-presidency-20/	"What short of suicide do I have to do to convince people I'm not running? Apparently, I actually have to commit suicide." -- Gov. Chris Christie, Feb. 16, 2011 "Now is not my time. I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon." -- Gov. Chris Christie, Oct. 4, 2011 There’s an old joke about politicians (also lawyers and women) that goes something like this: How do you know when a politician is lying? His lips are moving. Well, that leaves out Gov. Chris Christie, who announced on Oct. 4 that he will not seek the presidency in 2012 – reaffirming the same statement he has made numerous times this year, despite a chorus of support that has grown all year for him to join the race. "What short of suicide do I have to do to convince people I’m not running? Apparently, I actually have to commit suicide," the governor said in February. Christie is alive and well – and it’s likely the national spotlight will continue shining on him as he continues running the Garden State – and possibly becoming a presidential contender for 2016. Christie’s political status gained momentum after he became the state’s U.S. attorney. "I won't consider running for office again," Christie said in 2002, just before taking that office in 2003. "The door is shut." Actually, it was more like ajar. Despite his statement, Christie began doing things that made political watchers go "Hmmm." In the same 2003 story where Christie said he was done running for higher office, The Star-Ledger reported the following: "He lost 60 pounds. He was spotted dining with political power brokers. And he's traveled the state making speeches to civic groups." And much like this year with the national buzz about him running for president, early chatter in 2003 started and grew into a cacophony that Christie could be gubernatorial material for 2005. Of the chatter about him running for governor, Christie said at the time that hardly a day goes by when someone doesn't ask him about it - attention he said he finds flattering. Any of this sound familiar? Even after his suicide reference in February, Christie was spotted schmoozing with GOP financiers and criss-crossing the country to stump for others in the party. He also used those publicized and unpublicized trips – as well as various town hall meetings across New Jersey -- to remind people that he would not seek the presidency. Still, he offered speeches that sounded a lot like campaign stumps, and started to give coy answers when asked about whether he would run. During a press conference Oct. 4 at the Statehouse in Trenton, Christie admitted that he had been thinking about seeking the presidency when he spoke last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Next, word came that former first lady Nancy Reagan, President George Bush and Henry Kissinger were urging Christie to run. Speculation was at its peak. And there's a reason why, according to Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in Washington, DC. "Americans love to have choices and they love a contest (as do the media)," Bowman said in an email. "I think that is the source of the wild speculation. And, Chris Christie had some strong backers with terrific media connections who were pressing him to run and talking up his candidacy. His straight-talking persona appealed to many." Christie finally gave his answer Oct. 4, saying he would stick by his words and commitment to run the Garden State. "Now is not my time," Christie said during the press conference. "I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon." Making promises isn’t a difficult endeavor for Christie, who’s been in politics since age 14. That’s when Christie volunteered for former Gov. Tom Kean's gubernatorial campaign. And despite a bevy of political victories, Christie also had some political losses: He failed to get on the ballot for the state Senate one year, lost a divisive primary for the Assembly and lost re-election to the Morris County Board of Freeholders after a three-year term. As a political fund-raiser, Christie pulled in hundreds of thousands of dollars while serving on the finance committee for George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. That experience could be handy if Christie decides to run for president in 2016. So after months of stating loudly that he’s not running for president in 2012, Christie’s lips moved again Oct. 4 – and the words spoken numerous times before about not seeking the presidency were true. For that reason, we give Christie a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-10-04T15:20:00	2011-10-04	['None']
pomt-14001	"When a bill is sent to the governor’s office, there is no option for changing it. You sign it or you don’t sign it. While there was lots of conversation, there was really no opportunity for any sort of amending."	half-true	/iowa/statements/2016/jun/03/patty-judge/patty-judges-collective-bargaining-claim-half-true/	U.S. Senate candidate Patty Judge’s role in a 2008 veto of collective bargaining legislation has emerged as a key issue in Iowa’s Democratic primary, and the state’s largest unions have lined up against her campaign over her perceived unfriendliness to labor. At issue is House File 2645, a wide-ranging and controversial bill that expanded collective bargaining rights for public employees so that many more aspects of workers’ duties and work conditions could be negotiated. The measure flew through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate, going from introduction to passage in 11 days. But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat, vetoed the bill. Judge was Culver’s lieutenant governor. In his veto message, Culver criticized the manner in which HF 2645 was passed, calling it "a poorly written bill with sometimes-ambiguous language that raises troubling, unanswered questions and unresolved uncertainties for management, labor and taxpayers alike." In recent weeks the extent to which Judge and other Culver administration officials collaborated with lawmakers and labor leaders to improve the bill has been hotly debated. In an Iowa Public Television debate on May 26, Judge said she didn’t "believe there was a lot of back and forth on that particular piece of legislation" and said she "wished we could have worked more closely with labor." That led to a sharply worded retort from AFSCME Council 61, the state’s main public employees’ union: "Patty Judge is not telling the truth about labor’s engagement with her administration during this process," AFSCME President Danny Homan said. Then in a Des Moines Register/KCCI debate on Wednesday, Judge said she "regretted" how the bill was handled. "I wish that we could go back and negotiate a good piece of legislation together," she said. "But you know, we can’t. We can’t go backwards. We need to go forwards." She followed that up by telling the Register that by the time the bill reached the governor, the opportunity for making constructive changes had passed. "I regret that it had to be vetoed. That decision did not come lightly. There was a lot of thought, a lot of conversation that went into it," Judge said. "But when a bill is sent to the governor’s office, there is no option for changing it. You sign it or you don’t sign it. While there was lots of conversation, there was really no opportunity for any sort of amending." Did the governor’s office have no opportunity to change the bill in a meaningful way after it was passed? The history of HF 2645 provides the answer. The bill was introduced on March 14. On March 19, it was debated on the House floor, where it faced dozens of proposed amendments before ultimately passing on a 52-47 vote. It then went to the Senate, where it was considered on the floor on March 24. During a lengthy debate, more than 20 amendments were offered and rejected before the bill passed on a 27 to 23 vote. At that point, things slowed down. Rather than sending the bill directly to the governor’s office, Senate records show Majority Leader Michael Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, filed a motion to reconsider. That parliamentary maneuver freezes legislation in place and allows lawmakers to reopen debate — including, potentially, amending or rewriting the bill and sending it to the other chamber for further discussion. The motion to reconsider held HF 2645 in place for more than a month — until April 25, when Gronstal withdrew it and began the process of sending the bill to Culver to be signed or vetoed. The bill reached Culver on May 5, and he vetoed it on May 15. Judge campaign manager Sam Roecker on Friday argued that the motion to reconsider didn't change the governor's office's ability to influence the bill. "She has addressed the issue of the 2008 legislation and has said clearly she regrets the circumstances around which it was vetoed," Roecker said in a statement. "However, regardless of a motion to reconsider, the governor’s office does not have the power to introduce amendments to a bill before or after it’s passed by the legislature." Our ruling Judge said there’s no option for changing or amending a bill after it’s "sent to the governor’s office." That’s true, but it overlooks the month-long period in which this particular collective bargaining legislation was held under a motion to reconsider after it was passed by lawmakers. If legislators, the governor’s office and other interested parties had found a new consensus on the bill’s language sometime within that March 24 to April 25 window, the bill could have been reconsidered by the Senate, amended, returned to the House and ultimately passed in the altered form. For this reason we rate Judge’s assertions that there was "no option for changing" the bill and "no opportunity for any sort of amending" Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9824dadc-2713-4662-afe2-79c7f155e932	None	Patty Judge	None	None	None	2016-06-03T20:00:00	2016-06-01	['None']
pomt-09534	Vice President Joe Biden's meeting "with the transparency and accountability board . . . was closed to the public."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/09/sarah-palin/palin-claims-biden-held-transparency-meeting-behin/	Attendees of the recent Tea Party Convention gave a rousing reception to Sarah Palin -- especially when she talked about transparency surrounding President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus package. "Our administration promised that it would be good stewards of taxpayer dollars," Palin said on Feb. 6, 2010, in Nashville. Palin noted that the administration had promised openness and transparency, but said that Vice President Joe Biden recently met with the stimulus transparency board behind closed doors. "I tried to look into that transparency thing, but Joe's meetings with the transparency and accountability board? It was closed to the public. Yup, they held a transparency meeting behind closed doors," she said. There's something ironic about a transparency meeting being held in private, so we wondered whether Palin was correct. Generally speaking, private meetings among top officials are not unusual in Washington. That's how business is often conducted in the executive and legislative branches. In those cases, no reporters are allowed. In a few cases, one or two reporters are allowed into the room to compile what's called a "pool report" in journalism parlance. These blow-by-blow summaries are then circulated among the press corps. Meg Stapleton, Palin's spokeswoman, told us the former Alaska governor was referring to a Jan. 14, 2010, meeting between Biden and Earl Devaney, chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. It is an oversight committee that was created by the economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The board is supposed to provide transparency on how stimulus funds are used, and prevent fraud and mismanagement. Stapleton pointed us to a post on the Los Angeles Times Web site by blogger Andrew Malcolm, who noted that a meeting about transparency was closed to the press. "Unfortunately, the transparency meeting is nontransparent, closed to the press. ... Which makes it -- what? -- secret openness? Open secrecy?" Malcolm wrote. We checked Biden's schedule for the day, and indeed, he met with Devaney at 2:15 p.m. Jan. 14. The meeting was closed to the press: no transcript, no pool report. But it was not, as Palin indicated, a meeting with the full board. It was listed as a one-on-one meeting with Devaney. White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn said it was a meeting between Biden and Devaney to discuss measures Devaney is taking to prevent fraud. The spokeswoman said those meetings are typically closed because of the sensitive nature of the discussions. We found two other sessions where Biden and Devaney had been involved in public meetings together. In February 2009, the two attended an open meeting at the White House to talk stimulus bill implementation. In March, they held a conference with governors to discuss stimulus projects. A pool report from June 2009 described a meeting between Biden, Devaney and members of Obama's Cabinet regarding stimulus funding. Technically speaking, Biden is not a member of the transparency and accountability board, which, besides Devaney, consists of 12 inspectors general from various federal agencies. Minutes from the group's meetings indicate Biden has not attended any of its meetings. The group is required to meet at least six times every year, but has met a total of 18 times since March 2009, according to the Recovery.gov Web site. The White House did not respond to our inquires about whether the board meets in public or not. Nor did we find newspaper stories or press releases on the Recovery.gov Web site that indicate that these are open meetings. So, from what we can tell, these gatherings have been private, usually at an office building just a few blocks from the White House, though minutes from those meetings, as well as reports, testimony and financial activity reports are made public. But Palin's claim was strictly about that one meeting between Biden and Devaney. She is correct that Biden and Devaney met privately on Jan. 14. But she incorrectly said it was a meeting of the transparency and accountability board when it was just a meeting of the vice president and the chairman. So we find Palin's claim False.

pomt-02755	"The vast, overwhelming majority of [crimes that occur with a firearm] are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/15/michael-chippendale/rhode-island-rep-michael-chippendale-says-most-cri/	The adage, "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns," has been around at least since the 1980s. During an appearance on WPRO's Matt Allen show, state Rep. Michael Chippendale, a Republican from Foster, made a similar point when talking about gun owners and the fact that it is illegal in Rhode Island for state government to maintain a gun registry. "I think if we were to analyze all police records, we'd find that crimes that occur with a firearm are not perpetrated by lawful firearm owners," he said. "I would say the vast, overwhelming majority of them are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place. So they wouldn't show up on any sort of a register because they didn't obtain it legally. There's a strong argument that is supported by data, a lot of data, to support that point." It seems reasonable that most criminals probably wouldn’t go through legal channels to get the weapon they use in a crime, but we were interested in determining whether that was true for the overwhelming majority of cases. So we asked Chippendale about the data. He emailed us to say his data disappeared when his computer died about a month ago. But he said an analysis of crimes in Providence in 2012 by a firearms advocacy group showed that, as he remembered it, among 110 or so actual arrests in which a firearm was seized, the weapon was returned to the owner in fewer than 10 instances. Those, of course, would be the legal owners. When we asked him for hard evidence, he sent us several Internet links, none of which directly addressed the question. It turns out, despite Chippendale’s assertion, there's not a lot of data to support his point. In Rhode Island, we checked with the attorney general's office, Providence's commissioner of public safety, and the Superior Court, which has its own gun court. None collect data in a form that would allow easy analysis of the question. The commissioner, Steven Pare, expressed surprise that any of the guns seized in 2012 would have been returned. "It's rare that we return a gun that's been seized" unless it's returned to someone who reported it stolen, he said. Nationally, we checked with some firearm groups and academics who study gun violence. None who responded had statistics that addressed the issue. "You're probably not going to find direct evidence of the statement, since law enforcement agencies don't generally check specifically for legal possession, and certainly don't keep any centralized data that can be used to assess the claim," said David M. Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities and the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Nonetheless, Kennedy said Chippendale’s statement "is absolutely true. The overwhelming majority of gun crime is committed by chronic offenders who are legally prohibited from owning firearms; they have felony records or domestic violence misdemeanors, which are disqualifying under federal law. So by definition they can't own guns legally." We did, however, manage to find two sources of hard data. In 1997, the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed more than 203,000 prisoners. Among state prison inmates, only 14 percent reported getting their weapon from a retail outlet such as a store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. An additional 13 percent said they had purchased it or obtained it in trade from a family member or friend, which wouldn't necessarily make them legal owners, especially in states like Rhode Island that require a background check with a private sale. Overall, the study found, no more than one quarter were legal owners of their weapons, assuming the inmates interviewed were telling the truth about whether their firearm acquisition was legal. The other source is a December 2012 study that looked at handgun-tracing data for firearms recovered by the police between 2003 and 2006, as logged through the California Dealer Record of Sale system, which tracks sales of firearms beyond the initial dealer. The team led by Glenn Pierce of Northeastern University, in Boston, found that in 31 percent of the cases, the gun belonged to the people who were found with them. In fewer than half the cases -- 47 percent -- the last recorded owners and the people who possessed the guns were different. In 22 percent of the cases, there was not enough information to make a determination. Pierce cautioned that some of these 10,273 confiscations don't include the types of gun-related crimes that Chippendale was talking about. For example, they include cases in which guns happened to be recovered during routine traffic stops. If those are taken out, he said, "my guess is there would be the same or even fewer legally owned guns." Our ruling Rep. Michael Chippendale said: "The vast overwhelming majority of [crimes that occur with a firearm] are committed by people who don’t legally possess that firearm in the first place." Chippendale was wrong when he said there was "a lot of data" to back his claim. We found very little. The few studies we did find suggested that at least a majority of perpetrators of gun crimes don’t legally possess the guns they used. And the experts we talked with generally backed that up. Allowing for some hyperbole on Chippendale's part, and given all of the uncertainties in the data, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11502	"Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/feb/23/dan-patrick/dan-patricks-2017-teacher-pay-proposal-didnt-make-/	Dan Patrick indicates in a campaign video posted in advance of the March 2018 primaries that he’s championed a big bump in teacher pay. The Houston Republican, who seeks a second term as lieutenant governor, says: "Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers." That’d be quite the bump; the state’s 2017-18 salary schedule for teachers runs from $28,080 for starting teachers to $45,510 for a teacher with 20 years experience. We checked whether Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, offered the described proposal, ultimately finding that he talked up a desire to tell local school districts to spend money differently but didn't make a proposal affecting state spending overseen by lawmakers. Also, Patrick's district-specific mandate didn't make it into a legislative proposal. Patrick called for directive to school districts As noted in an email we fielded from Patrick campaign spokesman Allen Blakemore, on July 13, 2017, Patrick made a 34-minute presentation to reporters about legislation he expected the Republican-controlled Senate to advance during a looming 30-day special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott, who’d said the month before that he’d seek action to raise teacher salaries by $1,000 each, an idea that didn’t pass into law. Patrick, pointing out that he’d previously chaired the Senate Education Committee, called public education the "most important thing we do." He also noted that 52 percent of available state revenue gets allocated to public and higher education, a claim we later found Mostly True. Education also accounts for the smallest share of budgeted state spending in at least 20 years. Patrick called for lawmakers to direct school districts to shift more budgeted funds to teacher salaries. "I want the school districts, one of my goals, and it needs to be the goal of the Legislature to direct this," to "increase the amount of money they’re spending by 5 percent over the next four years on teachers," Patrick said. That move, he said, would drive up the state’s average teacher salary from more than $51,000 to $60,000. "Many teachers will make much more, some will make less," Patrick said. "But they all would get about an $8,000 increase if we just take 5 percent of the money that schools are getting. Remember, there’s a lot of room here, there’s a lot of room here. The dollars are in the system." Patrick continued: "Now some will say, well, that’s an unfunded mandate. That’s not true. That’s not what the governor is talking about. That’s not what I’m talking about. We’re simply saying prioritize the money for the teachers. If we’re going to have a great education system, we have to attract more teachers to the system, the best and brightest." In response to a question that day, Patrick said it would be up to districts to decide which budgeted dollars to shift to teacher pay. Patrick also said his plan would be offered as legislation by Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. Pay-raise idea not written into legislation Nelson, legislative records show, subsequently carried Senate Bill 19 through the Senate. A revised version of the proposal later died in the House. Yet it looks to us like Patrick’s pay-raise directive didn’t make it into SB 19. Nelson’s office didn’t respond to our inquiries about that. But in her initial filed version of the proposal, introduced July 20, 2017, the "Classroom Teacher Salary Increases" section called only for each district to increase teacher salaries by spending $1,000 more per teacher from available funds in a manner determined by the local school board. That amount aligned with Abbott's expressed desire. Two days later, the Nelson-led panel advanced SB 19 to the Senate after representatives of teacher groups testified that they couldn't fully support the plan because the envisioned raises weren’t accompanied by more state aid, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time. "According to Nelson's office," the newspaper said, "the Legislature next session will have to decide how to pay for the bill's $750 million pay raise provision, which wouldn't take effect until the 2019-2020 school year," the story said. Nelson reportedly told teacher groups in response: "It’s this or nothing." In the end, records show, the $1,000 raise language was no longer in SB 19 when the Senate advanced it to the House, though the revised legislation kept alive language stating that subject to available funding, the Texas Education Agency shall provide annual bonuses to classroom teachers based on years of experience--which Patrick also had offered as an idea in his presentation. A later version of SB 19, as amended and advanced by a House panel, had no provisions for raises or bonuses. State funding for bonuses? According to news reports, the initial bonuses were to be funded by lawmakers delaying Medicaid managed-care payments for two years though Patrick favored sending voters a proposed constitutional amendment to allocate money for the bonuses from state lottery revenues. Lottery revenue was already dedicated to school funding. But Senate Joint Resolution 1, introduced July 20, 2017 by Sen. Konni Burton, R-Fort Worth, called for requiring half of revenues generated by the lottery for education to be used to pay for salary increases and bonuses for classroom teachers with at least six years of experience and related retirement contributions, according to its fiscal note. "As a result, school districts would have less available revenue to fund all other operations," the fiscal note states. Records show a Senate committee held a hearing on the proposal, which wasn’t sent to the full Senate. A related measure, SB 97 by Sen. Charles Perry, R-Lubbock, also didn't advance. School groups say Patrick didn't make valid proposal Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials, among advocates for school employees responding to our inquiry about Patrick’s claim, said of SB 19: "A bonus is not a pay raise." Canby noted too that the legislation’s specified bonus amounts--$600 or $1,000, based on years of experience--fell short of Patrick’s envisioned $10,000. Lonnie Hollingsworth, Jr., of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association offered us his calculation indicating that if districts had been required to set aside 5 percent of operating expenditures in the 2016-2017 school year to boost teacher salaries, the resulting raises would average $6,708. "Theoretically, it would be possible to increase teacher salaries by requiring districts to reallocate existing funding," Hollingsworth said by email, "but we have never seen a mechanism that would accomplish this. Our preferred approach is for increased state funding with a requirement for a commensurate increase in teacher salaries." Clay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association similarly emphasized by email that Patrick didn’t call for state aid to pay for raises. Mark Wiggins, a lobbyist for the Association for Texas Professional Educators, said by email that "legislation to give teachers a $10,000 raise was never even filed." Our ruling Patrick said: "Last year, I proposed directing more of the education budget to teacher salaries, a move that would have resulted in an average $10,000 raise for teachers." Patrick made no proposal to direct more of the state's education budget to teacher salaries. Rather, he told reporters that lawmakers should tell school districts to set aside more money for such salaries by reducing other expenditures. That idea, which Patrick said would boost the average salary by $8,000, never got written into a legislative proposal. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06446	"About 57 percent of registered Democrats in the new (9th Congressional) district come from my old district."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/21/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-57-registered-dems-new-9th-di/	Slow population growth over the past decade has cost Ohio two of its 18 congressional seats this year to areas with faster growth. It’s the state legislature’s job to draw boundaries for the congressional districts, and Republicans, who control both houses of the General Assembly, have approved a new district map. That map -- currently under challenge by Democrats -- would likely force a primary contest between Ohio’s longest-serving Democratic members of Congress: Toledo’s Marcy Kaptur and Cleveland’s Dennis Kucinich. Kaptur and Kucinich both live in a newly drawn 9th District that stretches from Lucas County along Lake Erie into Western Cleveland. The district is comprised of parts of Kaptur’s old 9th District, Kucinich’s old 10th and the old 13th, now represented by Democrat Betty Sutton. (The new map parcels out Sutton’s old domain into five different districts. She has not said where she might run.) Kucinich had worried that his Ohio district would be zeroed out. He even explored running for Congress in Washington state, which is expected to have several open Democratic-leaning seats next year. But when the new map was unveiled, he dropped those discussions and sent his supporters a triumphant email headlined: "We Have a District!" "In a stunning development, the redistricting gave most of the Republican part of my old district to three incumbent Republican congressmen and left most of the Democratic part of my district intact," Kucinich’s email said. "As a result, about 57 percent of registered Democrats in the new district come from my old district. With your help I clearly have a good chance to be able to continue to serve the people of Ohio." In subsequent interviews, such as one with Truthdig Radio, Kucinich ratcheted down his estimate of his current Democratic constituents that would be in the new district. "So 54 percent of the registered Democrats from my district are in a new district, and 34 percent are from Ms. Kaptur’s district, and 12 percent from Ms. Sutton’s district," he told Truthdig on Oct. 6. "At this point, it looks like I’m headed for a primary against my friend from Toledo, Marcy Kaptur." PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Kucinich’s claim. Plain Dealer Data Analysis Editor Rich Exner examined precinct-level voting records from all three former congressional districts. He found that roughly 75,000 voters in the new district identify themselves as Democrats, and 32,000 as Republicans. Roughly 50 percent of those Democrats come from Kucinich’s old turf, while 26 percent come from Kaptur’s district, and 24 percent are from Sutton’s area. Kucinich spokesman Nathan White says that when initial descriptions of the new district filtered out around Sept. 9, Kucinich’s campaign came up with its 57 percent figure by comparing Census data from the cities and townships in the new district with Board of Elections data from all five counties. He said Kucinich’s Sept. 14 email stipulated that the 57 percent figure was an approximation. After the redistricting bill was introduced in Ohio’s legislature, Kucinich’s campaign reexamined the statistics and came up with a number closer to 54 percent. That’s why Kucinich used the lower number in subsequent interviews and discussions, said White. "Further refinements of the Democratic registration would necessarily depend on splitting the Democratic registration in precincts, and at that point, it’s guess work," White said in an email. "The fact remains that the majority of the registered Democrats in the new district come from Congressman Kucinich’s longtime Democratic base in Cuyahoga County, which is the point that the Congressman has been making." By our calculations, Kucinich overstated the percentage of Democratic voters from his old district that will carry over into the new one. But he is pretty close and he is correct that the largest portion of the new district’s registered Democrats are part of his old 10th District territory. Whether that gives him an advantage in a primary contest remains to be seen. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich’s claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-06262	In Chile "they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/28/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-chile-has-72-percent-national-s/	EDITOR'S NOTE: The following article has been updated since its original publication, based on new information received. In addition to the data we originally used to evaluate the statement, we have found another measure that more closely matches the percentage Gingrich used. We have changed the rating from False to Half True. During a CNN-sponsored Republican presidential debate in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 22, 2011, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., touted his proposal for overhauling Social Security, which he said is based on a pair of private-sector retirement-security programs -- one in the South American nation of Chile and one in Texas. We looked at both plans in the past -- Chile here and the Texas plans (in Galveston and two neighboring counties) in this fact-check -- but here we’ll look at a statistical claim by Gingrich that we hadn’t heard before. He said, "In Chile, for example, they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings." Is the national savings rate in Chile really that high? In our quick data search as the debate was under way, we concluded no. We found an international statistical comparison published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD -- a research group funded by most of the world’s affluent, industrialized nations. OECD published a table listing gross national savings rates in a range of nations, defining the statistic as saving as a percent of gross domestic product. Between 1996 and 2009 -- the dates for which Chilean data is available -- Chile’s highest national savings rate was 25.1 in 2007. In 2009, it was 20.5 percent. Both figures were well below the 72 percent rate Gingrich cited. Indeed, no country in the OECD’s table came anywhere close to 72 percent. Occasionally, a country approached 40 percent, usually Asian and Scandinavian nations. After we published the item with a rating of False, a reader wrote us to say that in our prior coverage of the Chile plan, we had written that "total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chile’s gross domestic product." Noting that that figure was much closer to what Gingrich cited, the reader asked us to take a second look. We contacted Michael Tanner, an expert in pension systems with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that has been supportive of the Chilean plan over the years. He said that both numbers have merit. The number Gingrich cited in the debate is commonly used, he said, but the candidate’s phrasing in describing it was imprecise. Tanner said Gingrich would have been accurate if he had said the savings held in the Chilean accounts are equal to 72 percent of the nation’s GDP. "But that’s not the same thing as saying that Chile’s savings or savings rate is 72 percent of GDP," Tanner said. "National savings is a much broader measure, including all sorts of ‘dis-saving,’ such as government debt, credit card debt and mortgages. That’s the OECD number. So Gingrich’s point was true, but phrased badly." In other words, Gingrich's phrasing in the debate suggested that he was referring to what economists call national savings -- that is savings minus debt -- when in fact the number he used just accounted for assets, unadjusted for debt. The latter number is much bigger, and that explains the difference between what Gingrich said and the OECD's much smaller percentage. Final note: Gingrich said 72 percent, which is higher than the 65 percent we cited for 2009. Tanner said that he did not have any updated percentage from 2010 or 2011, but that Gingrich's number is "certainly ballpark." Our ruling Gingrich said that in Chile "they have 72 percent of the GDP in savings." The number is basically right, but Gingrich erred in how he described the statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-11-28T11:14:45	2011-11-22	['Chile']
pomt-03384	"Every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/jul/09/phil-burress/phil-burress-says-all-major-religions-are-against-/	In two rulings on the final day of its 2012-2013 term, the U.S. Supreme Court struck downparts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 law that banned the government from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in states where they are legal, and let stand a lower court ruling that struck down a California gay marriage ban. The rulings left in place the laws that ban same-sex marriage in 37 states. Among them is Ohio. FreedomOhio, an advocacy group pushing to overturn Ohio's ban, said the high court's decisions add momentumto its effort to get the issue on the November 2014 ballot. Citizens for Community Values, a Cincinnati-based conservative group that championed the 2004 constitutional ban, said it was ready to fight measures that would bring same-sex marriage to the state. Phil Burress, president of the group, was quoted sayingin March that legalizing same-sex marriage in Ohio is unlikely: "I can't look into the future, but I just don't ever see it happening. This nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and, like Judeo-Christian beliefs, every major religion is opposed to same-sex marriage. You can't allow same-sex marriage until you destroy all religions." While his last sentence is matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate, we wondered about the accuracy of his statement about religious opposition. The Supreme Court decisions affected the legal recognition of marriage under civil law. They do not extend to religious recognition. But what do religions say about same-sex marriage? Citizens for Community Valuestold us it stands behind the statement by Burress, which was also cited in a Plain Dealer story last month, and added: "The mainstream, conservative and orthodox majorities of the primary religions in America, that is Judaism, Christianity and Islam, oppose same-sex marriage." They referred us to a comprehensive survey of the U.S. religious landscapeby the nonpartisan Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It details the country's current religious makeup and changes in religious affiliation. Pew also presents an overview of official positions on same-sex marriageamong major religions in the United States. These are the findings, summarized alphabetically: American Baptist Churches USA has affirmed that "God's design for sexual intimacy places it within the context of marriage between one man and one woman." Buddhism has no universal position on same-sex marriage. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes same-sex marriage, affirming that "marriage is a faithful, exclusive and lifelong union between one man and one woman." The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not endorse same-sex marriage; Mormon theology says that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God." The General Convention of the Episcopal Church last year approved a liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. "Each Episcopal bishop will decide whether to allow churches in his or her jurisdiction to use the new liturgy to bless same-sex unions," Pew reports. "And in those dioceses where blessing same-sex relationships is permissible, no Episcopal priest will be required to perform the blessing ceremony." Evangelical Lutheran Church in America defines marriage as "a lifelong covenant of faithfulness between a man and a woman," but allowed congregations to recognize and bless same-sex unions. Hinduism has no official position on same-sex marriage. Islamic law forbids homosexuality. In Judaism, the Reform and Reconstructionist Jewish movements support gay and lesbian rights, including same-sex marriage. The Conservative Jewish movement has a ceremony to allow same-sex couples to marry. Individual rabbis can choose not to officiate at same-sex weddings. Orthodox Judaism does not accept same-sex marriage. The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's position is that same-sex marriage is "contrary to the will of the Creator." The National Association of Evangelicals does not support gay marriage or civil unions. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- though, Pew notes, its General Assembly "urged state legislatures to give individuals in same-gender relationships the right to be joined in civil unions." The Southern Baptist Convention is opposed to gay marriage. The Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations passed a resolution in 1996 in support of same-sex marriage. The United Church of Christ’s General Synod has voted to legally recognize and advocate in favor of same-sex marriage. "Given the autonomous nature of United Church of Christ churches," Pew reports, "each congregation may adopt or reject the recommendations of the General Synod." The United Methodist Church affirms that marriage is between a man and a woman. "Religious groups do not speak with one voice on the same-sex marriage issue," said a report in March from Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, "but more oppose it than support it." "Religious groups fall on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate," the Public Religion Research Institutereported in March. Burress would have been on solid ground stating that the majority of major religions do not approve same-sex marriage. The opposition is significant. Most of the biggest religious groups do not accept same-sex marriage. But "most" is not "all." The opposition is not unanimous. Views varywithin Judeo-Christian tradition. The number of denominations accepting same-sex marriage has been increasing. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Phil Burress	None	None	None	2013-07-09T06:00:00	2013-06-26	['None']
pomt-12224	"In the ‘40s, 68 cents of every health care dollar was actually paid for by the patient, today it’s only 11 cents."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/19/ron-johnson/johnson-mostly-target-claim-out-pocket-health-cost/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has been taking a weeks-long ride on the health care roller coaster. After the initial Senate version of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was unveiled, Johnson was among those looking for changes. When a vote on that plan was delayed, Johnson said he was pleased and hoped the extra time would bring improvements. When a new version of the bill was introduced July 13, 2017, Johnson initially said he would approve a procedural motion to allow the new bill to head for a vote in the Senate -- but he was not yet committed to voting for it. By the following day, Johnson had moved from favoring a procedural motion to being undecided on it. Then the roller coaster rolled again, with rank-and-file Republican senators on July 18, 2017 denying the votes to move forward with a plan for a straight-up repeal of "Obamacare." Amid it all, Johnson has been adamant that spending on health care must come down. In a June 4, 2017, interview on WKOW-TV’s Capital City Sunday, which included discussion on Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Johnson said this: "In the ‘40s, 68 cents of every health care dollar was actually paid for by the patient. Today it’s only 11 cents. So nobody cares really what they pay for anything, which is why costs run out of control." That’s a big difference in costs. Is Johnson right about the big change in the percentage of health care costs paid directly by the patient? A history lesson According to a May 2008 article in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, medical care in the early 1900s wasn’t much of a system. "Health care was virtually unregulated and health insurance, nonexistent," the article said. "Physicians practiced and treated patients in their homes. The few hospitals that existed provided minimal therapeutic care. Both physicians and hospitals were unregulated. When patients saw a physician, they paid their modest fees out-of-pocket; they were more concerned about the wages they would lose if illness kept them out of work than about the cost of their medical care." In 1929, the first Blue Cross plans were established to provide pre-paid hospital care, and in the 1930s, Blue Shield Plans begin providing reimbursement for physician services, according to a history of the program. Things changed more in the 1940s -- the era Johnson cited -- as the nation’s population moved from rural to urban areas and medical care shifted even more strongly from homes to medical facilities. Milestones from the 1940s included the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 and the 1944 discovery of a drug that could kill the bacteria that caused tuberculosis. In 1946, the Communicable Disease Center (now the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was founded in Atlanta, and focused on fighting malaria, typhus and other communicable diseases. In addition, World War II played a major role in the expansion of health insurance to the general population. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s "Focus on Health Reform," the War Labor Board ruled in 1943 that some benefits, including health insurance coverage, should be excluded from wage and price controls. Employers then began to boost health insurance benefits in order to attract workers. Following the war, as the economy grew, labor unions also played a role, successfully negotiating for better fringe benefits, including health insurance. Johnson’s evidence Johnson spokesman Ben Voelkel said in an email that the senator was referring to the total of health consumption expenditures -- HCE, as the government refers to it -- and pointed us to a 1971 report: "National Health Expenditures, 1929-70" by Dorothy P. Rice and Barbara S. Cooper. According to that report, what is now called out-of-pocket spending for 1949 was at 67.7 percent. That’s the 68 cents on every dollar Johnson cited. Figures for 1960 and onward are found on the website of The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal entity. A spreadsheet titled "National Health Expenditures by type of service and source of funds, CY 1960-2015" shows that for 2015the share of health care expenditures paid out pocket was at 11.1 percent. Corroborating evidence Christopher J. Conover, a research scholar in the Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research at Duke University and a Forbes contributor at The Health Policy Skeptic, pointed us to his book The American Health Economy Illustrated. "Out of pocket share of spending has declined precipitously since 1929," Conover wrote in an email. "Initially this was due to expansion of private health insurance, but in more recent years, the expansion of public coverage (principally Medicare and Medicaid) has overtaken private coverage in terms of displacing what used to be paid for out of pocket." Some argue health insurance itself has helped drive up costs. Conservative analysts contend that people have little incentive to care about health care costs because someone else -- an insurance company, employer or the government -- is paying the bill. That means patients have little or no reason to shop for lower cost care and health care providers have little incentive to compete on price. This is the reasoning behind the support in some quarters for increasing use of health savings accounts along with high-deductible health plans to give people an incentive to shop for the best health care at the lowest cost. William S. Custer, associate professor and director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said although the notion that health insurance drives up healthcare costs has some evidence, the major driver of the growth in health expenditures has been new care health technology. "The reason most Americans have some form of health insurance is that it is the only way to finance health care," Custer said in a statement. "Most types of insurance cover financial risks, but are not generally the only way to finance the cost of a loss. Homeowner’s insurance can help cover the loss of a house to a fire. But a homeowner could also find a bank willing to lend them the money to rebuild. There is no such option for individuals needing health care." Further, Custer noted that in 1958 per capita health expenditures were $134, or 2% of median family income. In 2015, per capita health expenditures were $9,990, or 18% of median family income. "A heart attack can cost $60,000 or more, which is greater than the median family income with no alternative for financing that cost other than health insurance." In testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget on Jan. 31, 2008, Congressional Budget Office Director Peter R. Orszag, also that improvements in health and medical technology was a major component in the growth of health care expenses. "Most analysts agree that the most important factor driving the long-term growth of health care costs has been the emergence, adoption, and widespread diffusion of new medical technologies and services by the U.S. health care system," Orszag told the committee. Our rating Johnson said that "in the ‘40s, 68 cents of every health care dollar was actually paid for by the patient, today it’s only 11 cents." The numbers track with studies and official statistics. But Johnson is comparing two vastly different eras in health care, including one from a period when fewer people were covered by health insurance and thus paid for costs from their own pocket.

pomt-05394	Says the mayor’s job "is to make sure that if somebody is trying to build a set of water treatment plants to cure us from cryptosporidium we don’t have, we don't say yes even if CH2M Hill wants us to."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/jefferson-smith/did-city-portland-agree-treat-its-water-because-co/	In response to a question about rising utility rates, State Rep. Jefferson Smith said at the debate that mayors should guard against boondoggles. PolitiFact Oregon totally agrees with Smith that boondoggles are bad. But our ears perked up at what he said next. "The most important principle, I think, for a mayor is to be on boondoggle watch," he said. "Is to make sure that if somebody is trying to build a set of water treatment plants to cure us from cryptosporidium we don’t have, we don't say yes even if CH2M Hill wants us to." Last time we looked, the city did find cryptosporidium in our drinking water. Not a lot, but there were traces. More importantly, we think, the City of Portland agreed to build a treatment plant to guard against cryptosporidium not because of a contractor but because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency demanded it. (We no longer have to build as of March.) CH2M Hill, an engineering and construction company, certainly has been involved with the Water Bureau. The company would have gotten a piece of the contract for the UV treatment system we no longer have to build. We asked Smith to comment. And he said of course he didn’t mean to imply that CH2M Hill was behind the treatment mandate; he knows it came from the federal government. The broader point he was trying to make "is the power behind these big projects can be immense" and it can be far too easy for government to make decisions based on what powerful interest groups want rather than what’s important to the public. Certainly, large companies have the power to cajole officials into making some projects more important than others. But that’s not what Smith said at the debate. To the casual listener, Smith said that we don’t have cryptosporidium but we’re building plants to treat for it because a corporation wants us to. We find the statement False.

pomt-06794	Tax increases could "come into play" as a result of the debt ceiling deal.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/15/phil-gingrey/us-rep-gingrey-says-debt-deal-could-lead-tax-hike/	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey joined a large, unhappy, bipartisan chorus when he announced his "no" vote on the Aug. 2 debt ceiling pact. The Marietta Republican said in a news release that the deal didn’t do enough to advance a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to balance the budget. Also, it could cause disproportionate harm to the Department of Defense. But it was this criticism about tax increases that piqued PolitiFact Georgia’s attention: "It further concerns me that tax increases could come into play as the newly created commission formulates its proposal," Gingrey said. Tax increases could "come into play" as a result of this bill? There’s been a lot of talk about whether the debt deal could lead to more taxes, so we decided to check this claim out. We contacted Gingrey’s office and asked for proof, but it did not provide any. Fortunately, the PolitiFact National team in Washington checked out a related statement about the Budget Control Act of 2011 by U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia. "There are no tax increases in this debt limit bill. Period," Cantor said on Twitter on Aug. 1, one day before the debt deal was signed by President Barack Obama. PolitiFact National ruled Cantor’s statement Mostly True. There are no explicit tax increases or other measures that raise revenue in the bill, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will increase the debt limit up to $2.4 trillion and lead to at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years. But a newly created bipartisan deficit reduction committee could potentially recommend revenue increases. This is how it works: Roughly $900 billion in cuts were implemented with the passage of the bill. Additional cuts will be determined by the new Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, otherwise known as the debt "super committee." The committee is made up of 12 members of the House and the Senate, with six members from each party. Its goal is to reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over fiscal years 2012 to 2021. It must recommend cuts by Nov. 23. Then, both houses of Congress must give these recommendations in an up-or-down vote, no amendments allowed. If the committee deadlocks and can't agree to $1.2 trillion in cuts, or if Congress doesn't approve the committee's recommendations, an automatic $1.2 trillion in cuts take place in defense and domestic programs. Several programs, including Social Security, benefits for Medicare recipients and initiatives for low-income Americans, are exempt. And while the bill does not ban revenue increases, getting them passed by the super committee could be tough. Even if a tax increase gets through the committee, either house of Congress could vote it down. Also, there’s some discussion on how the Congressional Budget Office will decide how much the super committee’s proposal will reduce the deficit. Some argue that what method the CBO chooses could make it easier or harder to raise taxes. Still, we think the more relevant issue is that while the committee is not barred from raising taxes, its makeup and the realities of divided government will make it tough to do so. Since there’s room for a tax hike or two in the bill, tax increases could "come into play," as Gingrey said. His statement is accurate but could use a little more context. We give him a Mostly True.

pomt-05497	"By the time I finish this speech, two Americans will be slain, six women will be raped, 27 of us will be robbed, and 50 more will be beaten."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/16/wayne-lapierre/nras-wayne-lapierre-cites-frequency-violent-crime-/	When the National Rifle Association held its annual meeting in St. Louis on April 14, 2012, it came amid an often heated public debate sparked by the killing of Trayvon Martin, a Sanford, Fla., teen who was shot to death by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who said it was in self defense. The Martin case provoked strong public disagreement about the wisdom of "stand-your-ground" laws, which had been aggressively pushed in many states by the NRA. Wayne LaPierre, the gun-rights group’s CEO, took up the controversy head-on during his speech at his group’s national meeting. According to a New York Times account, LaPierre sought to put the Martin killing in context by noting that "violent crimes happen all the time in cities across the United States." Specifically, LaPierre said, "By the time I finish this speech, two Americans will be slain, six women will be raped, 27 of us will be robbed, and 50 more will be beaten. That’s the harsh reality we face, all of us, every single day. But the media, they don’t care. Everyday victims aren’t celebrities. They don’t draw ratings, don’t draw sponsors. But sensational reporting from Florida does." We won’t judge LaPierre’s conclusions about what the statistics mean, but we did think it would be worth checking whether the statistics are accurate. We began by figuring out how long LaPierre’s speech is. The YouTube video uploaded by the NRA runs about 33 minutes. That means that you could fit 43 such speeches into one day and 15,695 speeches into a year. To find the actual numbers, we first turned to the FBI’s uniform crime reports -- a detailed national accounting of crime statistics. Here are the overall numbers for 2010 for the closest categories to the ones LaPierre cited: • Murder and non-negligent manslaughter: 14,748 • Forcible rape: 84,767 • Robbery: 367,832 • Aggravated assault: 778,901 Then we calculated how many of these crimes would occur in a 33-minute period: • Killings: 0.94 killings every 33 minutes • Rapes: 5.4 rapes every 33 minutes • Robberies: 23.4 robberies every 33 minutes • Beatings: 49.6 beatings every 33 minutes Let’s first dispense with the most straightforward statistic: aggravated assaults, or what LaPierre called "beatings." LaPierre’s number is very close -- only off by about 1 percent. Meanwhile, using the FBI statistics, the figure for rape is also reasonably close -- LaPierre is high by about 10 percent. LaPierre’s figures for robbery are off by a larger margin -- they’re about 15 percent too high. So, LaPierre’s a little high on each of these claims, but by a modest margin. The one statistic where he’s far off-base concerns killings. His use of the word "slain" offers some room for interpretation. The closest FBI category is "murder and nonnegligent manslaughter." Using this number (14,748) LaPierre’s number is more than twice the actual rate of Americans who are "slain." A different data set -- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s annual tabulation of how Americans die -- counts "homicides" instead and found 16,065 in 2010, or 1.02 every 33 minutes. That’s a bit higher than the FBI numbers, but it still means that LaPierre’s estimate of killings was roughly twice as high as they actually are. We wondered whether LaPierre was counting suicides along with homicides. (The NRA did not return our request for further information.) But if he did, he would have been far off with that method as well. According to CDC, the combination of homicides and suicides was 53,858 in 2010, or 3.43 every 33 minutes, which would have made his estimate well short of the actual number. Our ruling Overall, LaPierre’s estimate was fairly accurate. He was very close with assaults, and off by just 10 percent for rape and 16 percent for robbery. But he offered a rate of killing that was twice as high as the actual rate. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True. UPDATE: After our story came out, the National Rifle Association got back to us. A spokesman explained that the claim "two Americans will be slain" during the speech had been calculated by adding the FBI figure for murder and non-negligent manslaughter (14,748) to the number killed in alcohol-impaired-driving crashes in 2010 as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (10,228). Rounded up, that equals two deaths during the period of the speech. However, we aren’t convinced by the methodology. The NHTSA data for 2010 includes 3,601 people who were passengers in the drunk driver’s car, occupants of other cars on the road, or bystanders. That’s only about one-third of the total fatalities. The majority of deaths in such crashes -- 6,627 -- are of the alcohol-impaired driver. We don’t think deaths of alcohol-impaired drivers fit the definition of "slain," unless you also include suicides more generally, which as we noted above would make LaPierre’s estimate significantly lower than the actual number. On balance, we are sticking with our ruling of Mostly True.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2012-04-16T15:50:54	2012-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-13650	In Buffalo's SolarCity project, "Andrew Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job."	false	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/05/carl-paladino/state-money-solarcity-buys-more-500-jobs/	Buffalo developer Carl Paladino, who’s no fan of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has worked to boost Donald Trump’s electoral chances in New York State. Now, he’s showering praise on Trump’s pick for vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and he’s using Cuomo as his foil. Speaking to The Buffalo News at the Republican National Convention, Paladino praised Pence’s jobs record. "I've been reading up on Pence. Pence created 2,000 jobs with an investment that cost about $5,000 per job. Andrew Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job," Paladino said, referring to Buffalo’s SolarCity project. "It's so obviously incompetent, if not corrupt." Cuomo’s investment in the SolarCity project, seen by many as a boost for Buffalo, has been criticized by others. Is Paladino right about Cuomo’s effort in Buffalo? Indiana’s 2,000 new jobs Paladino did not reply to our request on what formed the basis for his claim. Abby Gras of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. - a state entity similar to Empire State Development - pointed to one possibility. Subaru of Indiana Automotive announced last year it would create 1,204 jobs in Lafayette, Indiana. The state offered the company up to $7.9 million in performance-based tax credits, which comes out to roughly $6,500 per job. While not the numbers Paladino cited, he came close. The economic development agency has said the average investment in performance based tax credit for jobs created statewide in 2016 was about $9,400 per job. Cost of SolarCity jobs When the RiverBend facility was announced, the state said it would invest $750 million to build the facility and buy equipment that SolarCity needs to open. The state does not give money directly to the company. The state invested the money on the condition the company creates more than 1,400 jobs in the Buffalo area. Initially the jobs were expected to be in manufacturing. Earlier this year, the company said it will still create the same number of jobs - but not all in manufacturing. As The News previously reported, more automation at the facility will mean fewer manufacturing workers will be needed. SolarCity said it is still committed to a minimum of 500 manufacturing positions at RiverBend, while other positions will be shifted to sales, project development and other functions. If you count only the 500 manufacturing jobs, Paladino's statement would be correct. Spending $750 million on a facility for 500 manufacturing jobs comes out to $1.5 million per job. But the company’s agreement with the state calls for creating 1,460 jobs in the Buffalo area. The company also agreed to invest $5 billion in New York State and create 5,000 jobs statewide. If the company doesn’t fulfill its end of the bargain, it has to pay the state $41 million in penalties per year. Based on those numbers the cost per job for the company's commitment statewide is $160,000 per job, but the state says that’s not a fair way to look at it. "The problem with using grade school math to analyze an economic development project of this magnitude is that it doesn’t take into account the multi-billion dollar investment from SolarCity, and impact of the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created statewide," said Jason Conwall from Empire State Development. "When we evaluate supporting a project, we base our decision on all of its merits. So, while thousands of new jobs are part of the project, our investment is based on the project in its entirety, including the investment, new jobs and overall economic impact in both Western NY and New York State." The state also owns the building and the equipment it bought, which the state can use to attract another company should SolarCity leave. In the meantime, the state says the project has created about 1,500 temporary construction jobs. This is not the first time the state has undertaken a project like this. Since 1997 the state has spent about $947 million over two decades building the NanoTech Complex in Albany. The building houses both the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering and 4,000 employees from more than 300 corporate partners. The original building was a $16.5 million investment that was built and equipped to attract companies interested in investing in nanotechnology. Since then, more than $20 billion has been invested by companies into work being done at the facility. The project has largely been a success, attracting corporate partners like IBM and Samsung. The same idea is now being replicated in a handful of cities upstate like Rochester where a photonics manufacturing facility is planned. Comparing both Experts say comparing the SolarCity project to Indiana’s tax incentive program is like apples to oranges. Indiana offers a simple tax break. New York State is building and equipping a factory. The value of New York’s approach – and thus the cost per job created – depends on what would happen if SolarCity fails. If New York State could find a new tenant or even sell the factory and equipment, the state’s investment per job is much lower than if the factory and equipment has no value if SolarCity leaves. Ron Deutsch from the Fiscal Policy Institute agreed the two situations were largely incomparable. Our ruling Carl Paladino referred to Buffalo’s SolarCity project when he said at the Republican National Convention that "Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job. Paladino understated the number of jobs being created by SolarCity, which overstated the cost. The agreement between SolarCity and the state called for 1,460 total jobs to be created in Buffalo.

pomt-08363	"In Congress Tom Barrett voted to allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-tom-barrett-voted-allow-abortion/	Republican Scott Walker, hit with an emotional TV ad portraying him as an extremist on abortion, has responded with a spot that paints Democratic rival Tom Barrett with the opposite side of the same brush. The Barrett ad featured two parents whose daughter was raped, noting that in opposing abortion Walker does not support exceptions for cases of rape, incest or where the life of the mother is at risk. The ad inserted a hot-button social issue into the governor’s race. In the response ad, Walker’s wife, Tonette, hits a similar personal note. "As a mother, I can't imagine learning that my child was assaulted," she says. "But for Tom Barrett to lie about my husband's compassion for victims is just wrong. Scott's been standing up for victims of violence for years." A narrator finishes the job: "It's really Tom Barrett who's extreme. Barrett supports taxpayer funding for abortion. And in Congress Tom Barrett voted to allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born. That's extreme." Strong words in response to a strong ad. Let’s get behind them. The ad cites no specific vote to back up the claim that Barrett backed a measure that allowed the late abortions, but Walker’s campaign said it referred to Barrett’s 1995 vote, while in Congress, against the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. In the highly contested abortion issue, the partial birth abortion debate and the topic of late-term abortions are among the thorniest. Activists on either side agree on little -- not what to call the procedure involved in partial-birth abortions, now even how many abortions, if any, occur as late as the ninth month. Before entering this debate, some key background: In the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed abortion on demand up until the time of fetal "viability" -- sometime in the second trimester -- or later if the doctor determined it medically necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. The partial-birth abortion ban -- which passed in 2003, after Barrett had left Congress -- outlawed a controversial abortion method sometimes known as "intact dilation and extraction." It was used in most cases in the second trimester when the fetus had grown too big to be removed by the suction method commonly used in the first trimester. Public opinion was solidly against the procedure -- Gallup reported in 2003 that a majority of Americans supported the ban, with 68 percent saying it should be illegal. That pattern held back to 1995, according to Gallup. Congress banned it except when necessary to save the life of the mother. That ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. Now, to the language in the Walker ad, which says Barrett voted to "allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born." It should be noted, the ban in question was not pegged to when an abortion occurs during a pregnancy. It focused on a specific procedure, but left in place other abortion methods. The two sides disagree about the extent of abortions in the "ninth month," though it’s clear from government statistics that it is uncommon. In 2006 in Wisconsin, the last year before the ban took effect, 2 percent of abortions (197 of them) occurred after 20 weeks. That is the latest benchmark used. It is not known how many occur at various points after that. Nationally that year, 1.3 percent of abortions were after 20 weeks. But both sides agree on this: It is the Roe vs. Wade decision -- not the partial-birth ban -- that "allowed" abortions late in a pregnancy, albeit under limited circumstances. Barrett is solidly in favor of abortion rights and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood, but he clearly was not among the justices participating in the Roe vs. Wade decision. He has, however, been on both sides of the partial birth issue. He voted against the ban in 1995, but then changed his position and voted to override President Clinton’s veto. That override effort fell short. In 1997 and 2000, he voted in favor of a ban before flipping again by opposing it in 2002. The Walker campaign cites Barrett’s 1995 vote, but could have just as easily picked 2002. We will consider that last vote his position. So, was it a vote to "allow abortions through the ninth month, just moments before the baby is born"? Let’s review. Under Roe vs. Wade, late-term abortions were already allowed and the ban Barrett opposed does not stop them. The ban focused on a particular abortion method and was not tied to the gestation period of the fetus. Walker’s ad -- which makes no reference to the partial-birth issue -- makes it sound as if Barrett was voting in favor of Roe vs. Wade. Partial-birth abortions, even by the account of abortion opponents, were mostly limited to second trimester and earlier -- not commonly done in the "moments before the baby is born." While the two sides cannot agree on how common ninth-month abortions were then -- or now -- there is an element of truth to the statement: Barrett twice took a position that arguably blocked a narrowing of abortions, some of which could occur late. We rate Walker’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01821	Obamacare "already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/20/barbara-comstock/barbara-comstock-said-millions-virginians-lost-ins/	Republican Barbara Comstock is offering herself as antidote to Obamacare in her campaign for the 10th District congressional seat in Northern Virginia. Comstock says Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, should be repealed. On her website, she claimed that the law "already has caused millions of hardworking Virginians to lose their health insurance and have their well-being and financial health threatened." We hadn’t heard that statistic before and wondered if it could be correct that -- in a state with about 8 million people -- "millions" had already lost their insurance because of the law. We asked Comstock’s campaign for proof and were told it made an error. "Our website said ‘Virginians’ when it should have read ‘Americans’," Johanna Persing, the communications director for Comstock’s campaign, emailed. Comstock changed the wording on her site. There’s no doubt that millions of Americans in the individual market -- those who purchase health insurance themselves or are covered by small employers -- were notified last fall that their policies were being discontinued because they don’t fulfill minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare. No one could say exactly how many policies were cancelled, but media reports estimated the number was at least 4 million. The embarrassed White House offered a fix that allowed many of the disqualified plans to exist for another year. Some people were moved to a different plan by their insurance companies or got coverage on state exchanges created by the health care law. But Comstock’s original claim raises an interesting question: How many Virginians received notices last year that their policies were ending? Virginia doesn’t keep those figures, said Ken Schrad, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission. Doug Gray, the executive director with the Virginia Association of Health Plans, estimates 850,000 Virginians who bought their plans individually or got coverage through a small employer were notified their plans were discontinued. Gray stressed, however, that those people were given a choice to switch to a new plan or to renew their original policy for another year. A majority of them chose to keep their original policy through this year, he said. Our ruling Comstock’s website said that millions of Virginians lost their health insurance because of Obamacare. Her campaign acknowledged it erred and, after our inquiry, changed its site to say millions of "Americans" lost their health insurance. While we applaud the campaign’s admission of a mistake, that does not unplug the Truth-O-Meter. There’s no exact count on how many Virginians were notified last year that their plans would be ended because of Obamacare. A state health insurance lobbyist estimates the number at 850,000. But these people still had options; they or their employer could renew their old plans for another year or switch to new coverage. So Comstock’s claim about millions of Virginians losing coverage was unfounded and we rate it False.	None	Barbara Comstock	None	None	None	2014-07-20T00:42:07	2014-07-07	['None']
pomt-06158	Says 77 percent "of Portland's students finish elementary school without taking even one art class."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/16/creative-advocacy-network/do-77-percent-portlands-elementary-school-students/	These are hard times for Oregon schools -- budgets are tight, teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing. The Creative Advocacy Network, a group that seeks to expand access to the arts, added to that list early this month with a tweet that "77% of Portland's students finish elementary school without taking even one art class." We loved art class back in the day, so this tweet took us by surprise. Was it true that the vast majority of the city’s students went through elementary school without an art class? We phoned the Creative Advocacy Network to see how the staff had arrived at their figures. The executive director, Jessica Jarratt Miller, laid it out for us. The group called around to the six area school districts (Centennial, David Douglas, Parkrose, Portland, Reynolds and Riverdale) and got two pieces of information: The number of students in each of those districts’ elementary schools (kindergarten through fifth grade) and then the number of dedicated visual arts teachers in those schools. If a school had even one art teacher -- heck, even a part-time art teacher -- staff counted those students as having had an art class. When they tallied up the number of students who went to a school with an art teacher, they found they accounted for only 23 percent of the students in Portland schools. (A quick aside: They didn’t count charter schools.) We decided to replicated their investigation. First we got enrollment figures for the six districts from the Oregon Department of Education. The department also gave us the number visual art teachers in each of those districts. To be sure we had the teacher figure right, we compared that to the information the arts group had used and also called around to the districts for confirmation. Our numbers differed slightly from the art group’s, but we came pretty close. We found that Portland had the equivalent of 12.5 art teachers. Reynolds and Riverdale had one each, though Riverdale’s wasn’t full time. David Douglas and Centennial had none. After we’d sorted that out, we looked at the number of students attending a school that employed an art teacher. We found that number at just 20 percent -- even lower than what the art group initially estimated. (They later revised down their number as well.) The percentage, then, squared pretty closely with what the group had reported. That seemed fine and good, but we still weren’t sure about the statement. We wanted to get some thoughts from state and local education officials. First up, we spoke with Christine Miles, the spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Education. "That's a pretty broad statement," she said. "Our kids are exposed to visual arts, even though we may not have the money for a specialty visual arts instructor. A lot of regular teachers do put a lot of work into their art curriculum for their students. And some may not." Next, we called Portland Public Schools. That district educates the vast majority of elementary school students in the city of Portland and, according to the methodology used above, 72 percent of their students go to schools without dedicated art teachers. Erin Hoover Barnett, a spokeswoman for the district, echoed much of what Miles said, and added a personal twist. Hoover Barnett has a child a Rieke Elementary School, one of the schools that has no art teacher. During his two years at Rieke, she said, her son has been exposed to collage making, poster projects, puppetry and sculpture among other visual arts. "He gets a lot of art in his curriculum. All of our teachers work to integrate some art into the work they do," she said. "There's no question that in the best-case scenario we would have a licensed art educator in front of all our elementary school students. But we're not in that position with our budget and the way we're funded by our state." Hoover Barnett said teachers work the material into the curriculum, parents visit classes to share their expertise and outside groups bring artists into classrooms. "It's become a community effort to get our kids what they need," she said. We’d asked Miller, the art group’s director, about some of these programs at the outset of our fact check. "We can really value and celebrate the kinds of community programs that come into schools," she said, but it’s not the same as having a certified art teacher available to students. Miller also pointed out a 2011 report by the Oregon Arts Commission that looked at art education statewide. One of the big takeaways from that report was that 20 percent of Oregon’s public schools "did not offer any regular, stand-alone arts courses" and that nearly 10 percent of all students "attended a school with no access to arts instruction." That brings us to our ruling. In an effort to draw some attention to the lack of arts education at the elementary school level, the Creative Advocacy Network tweeted a pretty shocking statistic: 77 percent of all Portland elementary school children graduate without having taken one art class. They based this statement on the fact that most schools don’t employee dedicated art teachers. The statement is true but needs some context. Students throughout Portland -- and Oregon -- are being exposed to visual arts in different ways through different programs. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14063	"You can import as many hemp products into this country as you want...but we can’t grow it."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/may/22/william-devereaux/hemp-helpful-just-dont-grow-it/	At a senate judiciary hearing on Smith Hill May 10, William Devereaux, a lawyer, spoke on behalf of the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Bill S2763, called the "Hemp Growth Act," was up for debate. It would make it legal for residents to grow their own hemp plants if they have a permit and don’t have a criminal record. The tribe has historically used hemp, a cousin of marijuana, for many products, like blankets, ropes, and baskets, Devereaux said. "You can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it," Devereaux said. We thought this was an interesting point. We talked to Devereaux, and he elaborated. "I can go to the Whole Foods right now and buy a box of cereal with hemp," he said. "But if I grow it, that’s another story. It’s kind of ridiculous." Indeed, it does seem kind of ridiculous. We wanted to see if he was right. The history of hemp Currently, hemp is packaged with marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a letter he submitted against Senate Bill 2763. "Hemp is considered marijuana," he wrote. This interpretation came from a few court cases: New Hampshire Hemp Council, Inc. v. Marshall in 2000; U.S. v. White Plume in 2006; and Monson v. Drug Enforcement Agency in 2009. And therefore, "possession, distribution, manufacture, cultivation, sale, transfer, or the attempt or conspiracy to possess, distribute, manufacture, cultivate, sell or transfer" hemp is banned. But, this wasn’t always the case. In the 17th century, domestic growth of the plant was encouraged for production of rope, sails and clothes. The Declaration of Independence was signed on hemp paper. Historians even say the first American flags were made out of hemp, grown by none other than George Washington and Andrew Jackson. During World War II the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a "Hemp for Victory" propaganda film, offering to give hemp seeds to farmers, and allowing draft deferment to those who would stay behind and grow the plant for military materials (parachutes, ropes, and other things of that nature), according to a PBS Frontline timeline. In 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Agricultural Act of 2014. Section 7606 of that bill allowed for universities and others to grow or cultivate industrial hemp as long as it's for research purposes, or it’s allowed under state laws. The farmer also must be licensed. Can hemp get you high? In short, no. The hemp and marijuana plants both come from the Cannabis sativa plant. But, marijuana has much more tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the psychoactive substance that makes you feel high and want to eat an entire pizza. Hemp has a THC level of about 0.3 percent, on average, while marijuana can have up to a 25-percent THC level, according to a 2015 study. As Devereaux put it, "For you and I to get high on hemp we’d have to put six bales in a fireplace, light it up with lighter fluid and put a blanket over our heads." Importing hemp Now to the second part of Devereaux’s claim. Can U.S. citizens "import as many hemp products" as they want? U.S. Customs and Border Protection says that hemp products, like paper, rope, clothing, soaps, shampoos, and animal feed, can be imported into the United States. Hemp seeds, as long as they are sterilized, can also be brought into the country. And about that cereal at Whole Foods? A box of Nature’s Path "Hemp Plus Granola" will cost you about $5. Our ruling: Devereaux says "you can import as many hemp products into this country as you want . but we can’t grow it." He is correct. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the growing and selling of hemp, except under very specific circumstances outlined in Obama’s Agricultural Act. U.S. Customs and Border Protection allows for the import of hemp products and seeds, permitted they are "sterilized."

pomt-04250	"There is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/16/john-charles/will-more-half-new-sellwood-bridge-accommodate-jus/	There are people who think it fiscally irresponsible to spend road dollars on bicyclists and pedestrians when most people still use cars to get around. Case in point: The libertarian-minded Cascade Policy Institute think tank based in Portland and the proposed $299 million project to replace the Sellwood Bridge in Multnomah County. Analysts at Cascade posted a short essay on their website, pointing out that most of the new bridge will be dedicated to two percent of bridge users, "even though cars carry nearly 98 percent of all passenger-trips during the peak hours. Only about 40 percent of the new bridge will be allocated to vehicular travel, with the other 60 percent dedicated to non-motorized transportation in the form of bikeways and mega-sidewalks." The essay acknowledges a need for more space for walkers and cyclists, but adds this: "However, there is no reason to allocate 60 percent of bridge space to satisfy two percent of all travelers." Cascade is certainly entitled to its opinion, but we wanted to know if the numbers are correct. Is it true that more than half of the new bridge will be dedicated to a small percentage of users? To back up, Multnomah County is replacing the Willamette River bridge because it is failing. According to the county’s website, the Sellwood Bridge carries 30,000 vehicles a day, making it Oregon’s busiest two-lane bridge. The current bridge, built in 1925, has one 4-foot wide sidewalk that is so narrow that bicyclists have to squeeze past walkers, use the auto lanes or avoid the bridge. The new bridge will include wider sidewalks and lanes for bikes that double as emergency shoulder space for vehicles. Cars will still have two lanes. At its narrowest, the new bridge will double to a width of 64 feet, of which 24 feet will be forautos, pretty much the same as now. Looked at that way, it’s fair to say that roughly 60 percent of the new space will be for non-motorized vehicles, although that calculation doesn’t account for extra driving lanes at both ends to accommodate auto traffic or shoulder space to accommodate auto troubles. (The county reports that by square footage, the breakdown is 49 percent for vehicles and 51 percent for bicyclists and pedestrians; that backs up the gist of Cascade's statement.) Next, we asked John Charles, president and CEO of Cascade, how he derived the 2 percent figure. The answer? Field work! We love field work at PolitiFact Oregon. Here’s what they did: Charles and an aide visited the bridge on July 19, a sunny Thursday, and counted vehicle passengers, pedestrians and bicyclists. They counted 3,184 vehicles carrying 3,584 passengers over 90 minutes starting shortly after 7 a.m. Seventy-four crossed on foot or by bike. That breaks down to 98 percent by vehicle and 2 percent by other means. His numbers are solid. The project’s own environmental impact study puts daily volume of walkers and riders at 530 on a weekday -- 1.7 percent of total trips if daily vehicle traffic is 30,000. But here’s the rub: Part of the point of a new Sellwood Bridge is to grant more space to pedestrians and bicyclists, so we’re not sure it’s entirely fair to use current numbers, which are low because the bridge in its current condition is decidedly unfriendly to non-motorists. In fact, Rob Sadowsky, executive director of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance, isn’t surprised by the 2 percent statistic. Riders, he said, will "go over the Sellwood Bridge if they’re brave." The Oregonian’s commuting columnist even took a question last year from a rider who had been yelled at by a runner while crossing the Sellwood. Apparently, the sidewalk in question is so tight that the county has posted signs directing bicyclists to walk their bikes. Let’s look at projections for the Sellwood Bridge, which we acknowledge, are just that. The environmental impact study for the bridge projects 9,350 trips by bike or on foot every weekday by 2035, with motor traffic estimated at 39,000 a day. That would put non-motorized trips at 19 percent. We asked Charles of the Cascade Policy Institute for his response to the projection. "One, I don’t believe it. This city is famous for wild projections," he said. "They can project whatever they want, that’s the world they live in, it’s computer-generated fantasies. It’s not reasonable, and even if you got it, it doesn’t negate my prior point: There’s no reason to allocate that much space for that mode. They function quite well with narrower space." Charles agrees there should be a minimum amount of space for non-drivers, but says the new Sellwood is overkill. He points to the Hawthorne, Broadway and Burnside as stellar examples of bridges with abundant use by cyclists, walkers and drivers. Hawthorne, we should point out, has four driving lanes and two 10-foot wide sidewalks; one-fifth to one-quarter of its daily traffic is by non-motorists. Charles has a right to his opinion about whether the county is going overboard. And he could be right that the new Sellwood Bridge will never see the increase in non-motorized traffic projected by the planners. But the bridge of today is apples to the oranges of the bridge of tomorrow -- making the statistic he’s citing an inappropriate indicator of future use. Non-drivers make robust use of Hawthorne because of the space given them. Present bike traffic on the Sellwood Bridge is so low today because the current bridge is outright hostile and dangerous to pedalers, walkers and runners, with one skinny sidewalk close to a bunch of cars. That’s a significant detail missing from the statement. We rate the statement Half True.	None	John Charles	None	None	None	2012-11-16T00:00:00	2012-09-21	['None']
pomt-00958	Florida students take "an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year."	false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/18/florida-badass-teachers-association/teacher-group-says-florida-students-take-standardi/	Facing a backlash from teachers and parents over standardized tests, state legislators are discussing whether to pare down the hours students spend on testing. The latest batch of criticism about Florida’s tests coincides with a national discussion about Common Core state standards. One of the potential GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has long defended the need to use tests to make schools accountable -- a position increasingly at odds with other GOP presidential contenders. The Florida Badass Teachers Association, which is part of a national association that formed in recent years in an effort to fight back against testing, raised concerns about the tests as they planned to protest Bush’s Feb. 10 speech in Tallahassee. Thomas James, an association spokesman and Miami-Dade history teacher, leveled many criticisms of Florida schools, including this one in a statement provided to the Miami Herald before Bush’s speech. "Florida public school students have become little more than ‘test drones’ being bombarded with an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year," James said. James’ claim about the amount of days eaten up by tests caught our eye because it was more than double the number we heard from state legislative leaders in 2013 -- though Florida has made changes to tests since that time. How many days a year do students actually take standardized tests? Backlash over Florida’s new tests We found no simple answer to that question because it varies widely depending upon students’ grades, courses and district and other factors. Testing of Florida students has always faced some criticism but changes to those tests resulted in a fresh round of backlash within the past year. This year, students will start taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. (After the Common Core drew increasingly vocal criticism, the Florida Legislature last year renamed them the Florida Standards with some tweaks.) During his 2014 re-election campaign, Gov. Rick Scott promised to investigate the state testing program and the state expects to have a report ready for the beginning of the legislative session March 3. James told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his claim in part through a bill proposed in February by Senate Education Chairman John Legg, R-Trinity. That bill would require that students spend no more than 5 percent of school hours taking statewide and district-mandated tests. But that adds up to 45 hours -- not days -- of tests. How many hours do students take tests? The Florida Standards Assessments include reading tests in grades 3 through 11, math tests in grades 3 through 8, and science tests in grades 5 and 8. High school students must take six end-of-course exams in subjects including math and history, for example. For example, fourth-graders take 1.5 hours of tests in english language arts, 2.67 hours in writing and 2.67 hours in math. That adds up to just under seven hours of tests. The hours spent on statewide tests grew between the 2013-14 and 2015-16 school year. For example, fourth-graders now spend about one extra hour on such tests while a sixth-grader spends nearly three extra hours on tests. In high school, students take several more hours of tests. For example, a high school student may take 13 hours of statewide tests including language arts, math, biology and history. And then there are the district-wide tests. Some school districts also give their own district-wide exams that are not required by the state, usually to see how students are progressing in any given subject. We interviewed spokespersons in a few school districts to get information about the number of hours their students spend taking standardized tests. Miami-Dade school officials concluded that the maximum example would be for an 11th-grader who takes all required tests and two international baccalaureate (or "IB") classes which would add up to about 44 hours. In Pasco County, the typical student on average takes state and districtwide tests for anywhere from three to 26 hours. (This does not include the IB example cited by Miami-Dade.) James told PolitiFact Florida that the Miami-Dade testing calendar shows that testing gears up in March and high schools continue testing nearly through the end of May. But not every student is taking every test throughout that two-month stretch of tests -- and some days they are taking a test for just part of that day. (The Miami Herald wrote in September that only eight out of 180 days on the district’s calendar had no standardized tests, but any individual student would be tested on only a fraction of those days.) Asked about the claim of having testing on as many as 45 days, James said, "That would be the worst-case scenario." We should note that even for students who are not taking a test on a particular day or portion of a day, they still could be impacted in some way by the tests. For example, their teachers may be taken out of class to proctor other students taking tests. In May 2014 the Miami Herald reported that some classes at Dr. Michael Krop High School -- James’ school -- were watching movies, such as Frozen, or playing board games during such testing days. But we found no solid evidence to show the extent of students being displaced by other students taking tests. And in any case, this would vary district to district, school to school and grade to grade. How many hours each district spends on testing will become more clear when the Department of Education releases its report during the session. Still, Legg said there isn’t evidence that students are spending 45 days on tests. "It is very plausible that those students are doing 45 hours," Legg said. However, "I would find it impossible to do 45 complete days." The Florida Education Association, the union that represents teachers, argues that the number of days devoted to tests is even higher than what James stated and can reach 60 to 80 days. But the FEA counts any day during which a student takes a test for part of the day as a "testing day," and it also includes days when students are in training to use the computers to take the tests. The FEA also points to tests only taken by a fraction of students -- for example, schools whose performance is rated "D" or "F," which have to take progress monitoring assessments that higher-rated schools do not. Ruth Haseman Melton, the director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association, calls James’ statement an oversimplification. An entire day may not be eaten up by tests, but more time is eaten up by tests beyond just the minutes a student takes them. "It’s not accurate to count the number of days that tests are given, but it’s also not accurate to just count the time it takes to administer the actual test," which is what DOE and Senator Legg are suggesting," she said. Our ruling Florida students take "an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year," said James, a Miami-Dade teacher. Test days do appear to have risen in recent years, and students are not only affected by the tests they take themselves, but also by the impact of other students in their school taking tests. Pinpointing the number of days that students take standardized tests is difficult because it varies widely depending by grade, school, district and other factors. Even so, critics of the amount of testing did not provide hard evidence of any student taken up with testing for 45 total days a year, much less that it is a typical result in Florida. In fact, James’ own district said that the maximum number of hours spent on such tests would equal about 44 hours -- a small fraction of the figure James cited. We rate this claim False.

In the 2008 election campaign, ACORN was lambasted in many Republican circles for voter registration efforts that resulted in some fraudulent names (Mickey Mouse, it turns out, was not an eligible voter). ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. Some Republican leaders claimed it was a willful effort to forward the group's liberal agenda. So how does ACORN factor into the economic stimulus bill? Some Republican leaders have noted that a House version of the stimulus package includes $4.2 billion for "neighborhood stabilization." The Senate version of the bill calls for $2.2 billion. The money would be doled out to groups to buy up abandoned and foreclosed homes, to rehabilitate them and then sell or rent them out. The government already has such a program, but the money is only available to government agencies. The stimulus package would allow nonprofits to compete for this kind of work as well. Some Republicans view that as a backdoor attempt to fund groups like ACORN. "The legislation could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which has been accused of voter fraud, is reportedly under federal investigation, and played a key role in the housing meltdown," House Republican Leader John Boehner said in a Jan. 26 news release. Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter went one step further, telling Newsmax TV that "$4.2 billion dollars would be available to organizations like ACRON for so-called neighborhood revitalization. That's just political payoff, quite frankly, not in spite of their voter registration fraud activity, really because of it, in my opinion, in terms of support from some of the liberals in Congress." We read the fine print from the House version of the stimulus package and saw no money designated for ACORN, or any other specific nonprofit organization. Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the lion's share of the neighborhood stabilization funds would go to local governments. But the authors of the stimulus plan decided to open the process to nonprofits, she said, because they have found that some local governments could not, or were not interested, in participating in the program. "Some local governments were very good and some local governments didn't have the capacity to do it and the money just sat there," Brost said. Under the House plan, nonprofits would be allowed to compete to do some of the work. They would have to prove they are "capable of moving the money out the door quickly and efficiently," Brost said. "They would have to go through stringent competition. They would have to use the money to purchase homes, renovate them and then rent them out or resell them. They couldn't use it for anything else. ... We absolutely have to do something about foreclosed homes." If Democrats were trying to steer money to ACORN, say ACORN leaders, they sure picked an odd way to do it. ACORN has never done this type of foreclosure work, and according to ACORN's chief organizer, they don't plan to. In response to Boehner's statement, ACORN chief organizer Bertha Lewis stated: "We watch with bemusement as he tries to gin up opposition to progressive solutions to America's deep economic crisis by accusing ACORN of doing something we have never done. We have not received neighborhood stabilization funds, have no plans to apply for such funds, and didn't weigh in on the pending rule changes." Sister organization ACORN Housing Corp. has developed some housing in several cities, but it also has never done any foreclosure work. "We theoretically could apply," said Richard Hayes, director of strategic projects for ACORN Housing. "But we would have to compete like everyone else. There is no guarantee we would be chosen." Keep in mind, Hayes said, ACORN Housing and ACORN are separate corporate entities. They have separate boards and separate headquarters in different cities. So even if ACORN Housing were to apply for funds, it would not be comingled with ACORN funds for voter registration efforts. "They are trying to imply there is money set aside for us," said Brian Kettenring, an ACORN spokesman. "That is a fabrication for political ends." ACORN is obviously a negative buzzword in some conservative circles, and we think some Republicans are trying to capitalize on that to discredit the stimulus plan. Could ACORN Housing apply for some of the money? Sure. So could lots of other nonprofits. They'd have to compete, though. And they'd have to use the money to buy up abandoned or foreclosed homes, fix them up and resell or rent them. Boehner's comments imply money is earmarked for ACORN (it's not) or that money would be funneled to suspect voter registration programs (it wouldn't). And so we rate his comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02444	"We have more women living in poverty in this state than almost anywhere else."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/27/maxey-scherr/texas-among-top-slice-states-women-poverty-though-/	El Paso lawyer Maxey Scherr, who seeks the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, described the Obamacare law as vital to the health of millions of Texans in an interview with progressive Houston blogger Charles Kuffner. "We have more women living in poverty in this state than almost anywhere else," Scherr said in the interview, which Kuffner recorded and placed online Feb. 4, 2014. We do? By email, Scherr campaign spokesman Victor Reyes told us Scherr based her conclusion on state rankings in "Texas on the Brink," a March 2013 report by the Legislative Study Group, a Texas House caucus chaired by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston. According to the report, Texas ranks fourth nationally in the percentage of women living in poverty, a conclusion attributed in a footnote to information sorted by the Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. We clicked online to the Kaiser information and came up with a chart indicating that in 2011-12, 23 percent of Texas women were living in poverty, tying the state with California and Arizona for the fourth-highest rate nationally. According to the chart (see below), 24 percent of women in Hawaii were living in poverty; 26 percent of women in Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico; and 27 percent in Mississippi. Source: Web page, "Adult Poverty Rate by Gender," State Health Facts, the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation (accessed Feb. 13, 2014) A Kaiser explanatory note says the women-in-poverty percentages reflect the share of female adults aged 19-64 with incomes less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four in every state but Alaska and Hawaii, that poverty level was $22,350 in 2011 and $23,050 in 2012, according to the note. This information also can be sorted by the number of women in poverty in each state. By this metric, Texas--with nearly 1.8 million women in poverty--trailed only California, with 2.7 million women in poverty (see below). Source: Web page, "Adult Poverty Rate by Gender," State Health Facts, the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation (accessed Feb. 13, 2014) Next, we wondered if the presented rates and rankings were up to date. Nope: By email, Jennifer Lee, a researcher for the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving the poor, sent us a chart she built using the latest estimates from the American Community Survey for 2012 as overseen by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the 2012 estimates, 17.8 percent of Texas women aged 18-64 lived in poverty that year. Fourteen states had more women in poverty: Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arkansas, Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oregon and Michigan, according to the chart. But rounding these percentages leaves Texas tied for fifth--with Ohio, Montana, Florida and Oklahoma--with 18 percent of women in poverty, the chart indicates. Mississippi, ranked No. 1, was alone with 25 percent of women in poverty. In raw numbers, California led the nation with 2 million women in poverty, according to the chart, followed by Texas (1.4 million) and Florida and New York (1 million each). Lee said: "Poverty is consistently higher for females than for men across the country. There are a lot of causes of this, but one is that many women work in historically underpaid jobs. Women who must raise children alone are especially vulnerable." Our ruling Scherr said more women live in poverty in Texas than almost anywhere else. In raw numbers, California in 2012 had the most women in poverty followed by Texas. But poverty rate is a more reasonable yardstick to compare states. The rounded Texas rate--indicating about 18 percent of its women aged 18-64 lived in poverty in 2012--tied the state for fifth with some other states. Breaking out each state's rate to tenths of percentage points, though, shows 14 states with a greater share of women in poverty than Texas.

pomt-10622	"You know, Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years..."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/hillary-clinton/thats-no-typo-100-years/	To highlight the different approaches between Democrats and Republicans on keeping troops in Iraq, Sen. Hillary Clinton pointed to remarks Sen. John McCain made in the days before the New Hampshire primary that indicated his support for a prolonged military commitment in the region. Clinton has said that, if elected, one of her first official actions would be to direct military leaders to draft a viable plan to begin a phased withdrawal within 60 days. Her goal is to have most troops out of Iraq by the end of 2013. Clinton's account of McCain's position rings true. The Arizona senator was an enthusiastic supporter of President Bush's surge and opposes a timetable for troop withdrawal. He was somewhat glib about the issue during a Jan. 3, 2008, town hall meeting in Derry, N.H. When a voter asking a question made the point that President Bush raised the possibility American troops would be in Iraq for 50 years, McCain interrupted by saying, "maybe 100." McCain went on to note the United States has maintained a military presence for decades in such places as Japan and South Korea. He said he supported such a commitment in a global hot spot like Iraq where al-Qaida continues to wield influence and recruit followers — as long as there aren't American casualties. McCain expanded on those thoughts three days later during an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, asserting that most Americans share his views. "We have a base in Turkey. We have a base in Japan, Germany. We've had bases there. It's not American presence that bothers the American people, it's American casualties," McCain said. "And if Americans are safe wherever they are in the world, Americans — the American people don't mind that. So what I believe we can achieve is a reduction in casualties to the point where the Iraqis are doing the fighting and dying, we're supporting them, and, over time, then it'll be the relation between the two countries." McCain skirted questions about what kind of troop levels are acceptable in coming decades. Because McCain unabashedly entertains the possibility of an open-ended military commitment in Iraq — with little more than a proviso that American personnel should not come in harm's way — we rule Clinton's statement True.

pomt-09886	The health care reform bill "would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/	Republicans have found many reasons to oppose the Democrats' health care proposal, but this is one of the oddest. Betsy McCaughey, chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and former lieutenant governor of New York state, says the bill goes too far to encourage senior citizens to end their lives. On the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16, 2009, McCaughey said "Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner." She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to "decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short." Her point has caught on with conservative pundits. On his July 21 show, Rush Limbaugh said the following: "Mandatory counseling for all seniors at a minimum of every five years, more often if the seasoned citizen is sick or in a nursing home. ... That's an invasion of the right to privacy. We can't have counseling for mothers who are thinking of terminating their pregnancy, but we can go in there and counsel people about to die." McCaughey is no stranger to the health care debate. In 1994, she wrote a scathing review of the Clinton administration's health care plan in the New Republic, a left-leaning magazine, arguing that the proposal would lead to rationing of treatment and would prevent patients from choosing health insurance. Republicans seized on the key points of "No Exit," forcing the Clintons to issue a response to the article. She jumped back into the fray earlier this year while Congress was debating a $787 billion stimulus package. In a Feb. 9 Bloomberg op-ed column, McCaughey criticized the bill for including a plan to monitor health treatments to see which are most cost effective. The elderly, she said, would be denied treatment as a result. Now the Democratic health care bill is in her sights. In her chat with Thompson, McCaughey said the language can be found on page 425 of the health care bill, so we started there. Indeed, Sec. 1233 of the bill, labeled "Advance Care Planning Consultation" details how the bill would, for the first time, require Medicare to cover the cost of end-of-life counseling sessions. According to the bill, "such consultation shall include the following: An explanation by the practitioner of advance care planning, including key questions and considerations, important steps, and suggested people to talk to; an explanation by the practitioner of advance directives, including living wills and durable powers of attorney, and their uses; an explanation by the practitioner of the role and responsibilities of a health care proxy." Medicare will cover one session every five years, the legislation states. If a patient becomes very ill in the interim, Medicare will cover additional sessions. Jon Keyserling, general counsel and vice president of public policy for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, which supports the provision, said the bill doesn't encourage seniors to end their lives, it just allows some important counseling for decisions that take time and consideration. "These are very serious conversations," he said. "It needs to be an informative conversation from the medical side and it needs to be thought about carefully by the patient and their families." In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives, said Jim Dau, national spokeman for AARP, a group that represents people over 50 that has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision. McCaughey's comments are "not just wrong, they are cruel," said Dau. "We want to make sure people are making the right decision. If some one wants to take every life-saving measure, that's their call. Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families, and that's their decision, too." Both Keyserling and Dau were particularly troubled that McCaughey insisted — three times, to be exact — that the sessions would be mandatory, which they are not. For his part, Keyserling said he and outside counsel read the language carefully to make sure that was not the case. "Neither of us can come to the conclusion that it's mandatory." he said. "This new consultation is just like all in Medicare: it's voluntary." "The only thing mandatory is that Medicare will have to pay for the counseling," said Dau. For our ruling on this one, there's really no gray area here. McCaughey incorrectly states that the bill would require Medicare patients to have these counseling sessions and she is suggesting that the government is somehow trying to interfere with a very personal decision. And her claim that the sessions would "tell [seniors] how to end their life sooner" is an outright distortion. Rather, the sessions are an option for elderly patients who want to learn more about living wills, health care proxies and other forms of end-of-life planning. McCaughey isn't just wrong, she's spreading a ridiculous falsehood. That's a Pants on Fire.	None	Betsy McCaughey	None	None	None	2009-07-23T19:02:24	2009-07-16	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-01655	"More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/21/michael-medved/talk-show-host-police-kill-more-whites-blacks/	The turmoil in Ferguson, Mo., has spurred many assertions that blacks are unfairly victimized by police. Conservative talk show host Michael Medved aimed to turn that argument on its head. In a post-show summary on his website this week, Medved cast police as the protectors of African-Americans. Medved said that blacks are much more likely to be killed by another black person than they are by a cop. "When it comes to keeping black youths from violent death, police aren’t the problem – in fact, they’re a crucial part of any solution," Medved said. As for the charge that police target blacks, Medved said the opposite is true. "More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings," he said. We asked Medved’s producers for the source of that claim and did not hear back before we published. Thanks to the good work by the team at fivethirtyeight.com, we know that there is no precise accounting of how many people the police kill. An unknown number of deaths go unreported because the coroner failed to note it or police departments categorize deaths in different ways, or some other data glitch got in the way. However, even the incomplete figures gathered by the government tell us that Medved could be partially correct and still ignore a huge piece of the picture. Yes, more whites than blacks die as a result of an encounter with police, but whites also represent a much bigger chunk of the total population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps data on fatal injuries from 1999 to 2011 and one category is homicides by legal intervention. The term "legal intervention" covers any situation when a person dies at the hands of anyone authorized to use deadly force in the line of duty. Over the span of more than a decade, 2,151 whites died by being shot by police compared to 1,130 blacks. In that respect, Medved is correct. However, Brian Forst, a professor in the Department of Justice, Law and Criminology at American University, said this difference is predictable. "More whites are killed by the police than blacks primarily because whites outnumber blacks in the general population by more than five to one," Forst said. The country is about 63 percent white and 12 percent black. Rather than comparing the raw numbers, you can look at the likelihood that a person will die due to "legal intervention" in the same way you might look at the chance a person will die in a car accident or a disease like lung cancer. When you do that, the numbers flip. A 2002 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that the death rate due to legal intervention was more than three times higher for blacks than for whites in the period from 1988 to 1997. That is not the final story though. There are different theories as to why the black rate is so much higher. Candace McCoy is a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York. McCoy said blacks might be more likely to have a violent encounter with police because they are convicted of felonies at a higher rate than whites. Felonies include everything from violent crimes like murder and rape, to property crimes like burglary and embezzlement, to drug trafficking and gun offenses. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that in 2004, state courts had over 1 million felony convictions. Of those, 59 percent were committed by whites and 38 percent by blacks. But when you factor in the population of whites and blacks, the felony rates stand at 330 per 100,000 for whites and 1,178 per 100,000 for blacks. That’s more than a three-fold difference. McCoy noted that this has more to do with income than race. The felony rates for poor whites are similar to those of poor blacks. "Felony crime is highly correlated with poverty, and race continues to be highly correlated with poverty in the USA," McCoy said. "It is the most difficult and searing problem in this whole mess." On his website, Medved tried to link police killings with whether someone resisted arrest. "If you defer and don’t try to challenge a police officer, he may insult you but he won’t kill you," Medved said. But criminologist Lorie Fridell at the University of South Florida told PunditFact that the research on this point is mixed. Some studies that factor in the level of resistance show that race doesn’t matter, and some show that it does. Our ruling Medved said that police kill more whites than blacks. In absolute terms, that is accurate. However, the statement ignores that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. When comparing death rates, blacks are about three times more likely than whites to die in a confrontation with police. Medved’s statement leaves out significant information that would change someone’s understanding of the topic. We rate his claim Half True. Update: The number of deaths due to legal intervention were changed after we initially published this report to include only firearms deaths, which lowered the overall totals. The rating remains the same. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/496cb988-8485-4be0-9ea5-d480ed262d1e	None	Michael Medved	None	None	None	2014-08-21T16:53:13	2014-08-19	['None']
pomt-14546	Quotes Mark Cuban as saying, "I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/12/viral-image/facebook-post-incorrectly-quotes-mark-cuban-millen/	Fact-checking is driving millions of young people to vote Democratic, so says Shark Tank investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Or at least that’s what a Facebook post says. Readers shared with us this picture that features Mark Cuban, a self-described libertarian and Sharknado 3 president of the United States, saying, "I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything and they know Republicans are completely out of touch and are running a campaign of hatred and lies." We love shoutouts to fact-checking, but this post needs its own facts checked. We can’t find any evidence, anywhere, that Cuban said this or anything like it. We scoured the Internet, news archives, Cuban’s blog and social media accounts, but we didn’t find anything that matches the quote paired with this picture. We were able to reach Cuban over Twitter, asking him if this is something he ever said. He replied, "No." We traced the image to a post on a Facebook page called "Point Counter Point," which bills itself as "responding to Republican lies." We reached out to the page administrator via Facebook message to see how they came up with this quote but have yet to hear back. We did find a recent instance in which Cuban discussed why millennials seem to support Democrats, particularly Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the same post, he criticizes Republicans alongside Democrats. Millennials like Sanders because they believe in "sociocapitalism" rather than just capitalism, meaning they expect businesses to have some sort of charitable element and inclusive practices, Cuban wrote on his blog, "Maverick Blog: Mark Cuban’s Weblog," on Feb. 8. He’s noticed this trend through his experience listening to business pitches from 20-somethings as an investor on ABC’s Shark Tank. "So how can it be a surprise that millennials are excited about Bernie Sanders?" he wrote. "Millennials expect capitalism to reflect a socialist element." He wrote that no candidate in either party has shown a single instance of leadership; rather, they are too focused on conforming to party principles. They’re all also "technologically illiterate" and unprepared to handle the country’s growing technological needs. But his post did not reference fact-checking, nor did he say Republicans are "running a campaign of hatred and lies." If we find a verified instance of him saying what the post alleges, we will revisit the fact-check. Cuban remains an undecided voter, as far as we can tell. He has said, though, that he wants "anybody but" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and he thinks fellow billionaire Donald Trump is shaking up politics in a good way because he speaks his mind and doesn’t just play to the base of the Republican Party. Cuban has said he shares Republicans’ desire for small government, but disagrees with many of their social positions. Cuban says he voted for President Barack Obama in 2008. Our ruling A Facebook post quotes Mark Cuban as saying, "I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything." There’s no evidence Cuban ever said that. As far as we can tell, it’s a made-up quotation. Pants on Fire! Editor's note: Shortly after publishing this article, Cuban confirmed that he never said this quote. We've updated the story to include his response.

pomt-08530	"Barbara Boxer voted to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/04/crossroads-gps/ad-against-boxer-says-hospitals-might-stop-taking-/	Republicans are using the health care law as a springboard to attack Democrats on Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors. But some ads leave out so many details that they seem intended to simply scare people with threats of lost care. Such is the case in an ad from Crossroads GPS, a Republican-controlled issues advocacy organization that is not required to disclose its donors. Crossroads GPS released an ad targeting California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who faces Republican challenger Carly Fiorina on Nov. 2, 2010. "California seniors are worried," the ad begins. "Barbara Boxer voted to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether. Boxer's cuts would sharply reduce benefits for some, and could jeopardize access to care for millions of others." The ad then advises, "Check the facts and take action. Call Boxer; stop the Medicare cuts." So we decided to step in. We're checking the ad's claim that Boxer voted "to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether." We've looked into the claim of $500 billion in cuts to Medicare several times. The health care law --- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 -- does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. The health care law tries to change Medicare in a couple of ways. It improves the program for beneficiaries by paying more for prescription drugs and preventive care. It attempts to curb Medicare spending, both to make the program more efficient and to help pay for new programs for the uninsured. (The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation created an easily digestible tutorial on the overall changes to Medicare under health care reform.) Of the $500 billion in reduced spending going forward, some comes from relatively minor changes, such as $36 billion in savings from increased premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative streamlining. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. More significantly, there's $136 billion in projected savings from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. Finally -- and here's where we get to the part about hospitals and nursing homes -- there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient -- for instance, by lowering payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These reductions have some people concerned, particularly Richard Forster, the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. Foster has issued several reports warning that the reduced payments will not achieve the cost savings that the law projects. The ad against Boxer throws up the logo of the Washington Post when it runs the words "could stop taking Medicare altogether" on the screen. We tracked the quote back to the actuary's November 2009 report. The report says that, over time, health care providers would have a more difficult time finding efficiencies and that some facilities might find it difficult to remain profitable. The actuary repeated that concern after the health care law's final passage in an April 2010 report. The actuary's projections showed that about 15 percent of all providers would become unprofitable during the next decade if the payment reductions stay in place. "Although this policy could be monitored over time to avoid such an outcome, changes would likely result in smaller actual savings than shown here for these provisions," the report concluded. At this point, let's take a minute to note a few factual conclusions: Yes, Boxer voted for the health care bill, but it didn't cut $500 billion out of the current Medicare program. Instead, it slowed growth over the next 10 years. And not all of that $500 billion applied to hospitals and nursing homes. It was only about $220 billion in prospective reduced payments that concerned the chief actuary. That's what the ad calls "cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether." Opinions differ on whether the reductions in Medicare payments are realistic or impossible to achieve. We won't resolve this policy dispute here. However, it's important to note that even those who think the payment reductions are unrealistic don't necessarily expect hospitals to stop taking Medicare. Instead, they expect the law to cost more than is projected. "Hospitals are not going to stop taking Medicare. It's too big a part of their revenue," said Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. "I can say that's not going to actually happen, because someone is going to intervene. And when you intervene, you're not going to have the budget consequences that you originally envisioned," she said. This same issue has played out with payments to doctors, who have been scheduled for payment reductions under Medicare for several years. Congress has delayed those payment reductions repeatedly. The current fix will expire Dec. 1, 2010. Wilensky said this is the critical issue Congress will have to address soon. "You can't really talk sensibly about fixing Medicare unless you address how you pay physicians," Wilensky said. "We're not really addressing what we have to do to fix Medicare in a key, fundamental way." Boxer's campaign, meanwhile, pointed to her votes on fixes for physicians as evidence that she also wouldn't let payment reductions to hospitals and nursing homes affect patient care. Boxer voted for a bill in October 2009 that would have permanently fixed doctor's payments; the bill failed in the Senate. "Sen. Boxer has consistently voted against dangerously high pay cuts to doctors that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries, because she is concerned that these cuts would limit seniors’ access to health care," said campaign spokesman Matthew Kagan. In our ruling, it's true that Boxer voted for the health care law, and that law includes reductions in payments for hospitals and nursing homes. But $500 billion includes all the cost reductions for Medicare; the reductions for hospitals and nursing homes are about $220 billion. Finally, those warning about the spending reductions say that it's unlikely Congress will allow them to go forward if they affect patient care.

pomt-05265	Says Tom Barrett "voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/29/national-rifle-association/wisconsin-recall-nra-says-dem-challenger-tom-barre/	In the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall campaign, Democratic challenger Tom Barrett has been hit by Republican Gov. Scott Walker on his record as Milwaukee's mayor. Taking a new tack, the National Rifle Association, which has endorsed Walker, goes back in time to attack Barrett's record in Congress, where he served for a decade before deciding not to run again in 2002. In a radio ad that began airing in May 2012, two men talk about Barrett. Here’s part of the conversation: Man 1: "Well, Barrett voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles." Man 2: "I love my deer rifle. Barrett voted to ban ‘em?" Man 1: "Yeah." Wisconsin's gun deer hunting season is months away, but you can bet the hundreds of thousands of hunters in the Badger State took notice of the NRA's claim. Is it on target? To back its claim, the NRA cited Barrett's 1994 vote to ban the manufacture, sale and new ownership of 19 semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The measure was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who said the guns "were designed to kill people" and "had no place on a deer hunt." The law contained provisions, however, allowing sales of the guns to continue. And the law expired in 2004, after Republican leaders in Congress refused to consider renewing it. Among the weapons covered by the law were semiautomatic rifles that had "an ability to accept a detachable magazine" and at least two of these characteristics: "folding or telescoping stock; a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a bayonet mount; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher." Does this apply to "a lot of common deer rifles" as the ad claims? NRA’s evidence NRA research director John Frazer cited five newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Soviet-model AK-47 assault rifle was becoming more popular with hunters in that area, including deer hunters. One gun shop owner was quoted as saying hunters had been using military-style semi-automatic rifles since before World War II. The Houston Post reported that, according to local gun shop managers, it was not uncommon for Texans to hunt with semiautomatic rifles. That article didn’t indicate, however, whether the specific guns targeted in the ban were commonly used for deer hunting. On a national scale, American Hunter magazine praised the Heckler & Koch 91 as a hunting rifle for deer and other game, but didn’t indicate whether it was popular among deer hunters. In fact, the writer said the gun might be a "‘black sheep’ to traditionalists." Similarly, American Rifleman praised a particular type of AK-47 ammunition for hunting white-tail deer, but didn’t discuss whether the gun itself was common among deer hunters. The magazine later reported, though, that "hundreds of thousands of shooters and hunters," including whitetail deer hunters, were using another gun covered by the ban, the AR-15. So, there’s an indication that some deer hunters used the weapons targeted by the ban, but none of the articles was specific to Wisconsin. The NRA’s claim was broad in nature, but its ad is aimed at Wisconsin voters. Wisconsin experts We contacted three Wisconsin gun deer hunting experts. Each said flatly that the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994. The experts were Tim Lawhern, administrator of the enforcement division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the state agency that oversees deer hunting; Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association and Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Each has more than 30 years of experience hunting deer. Lawhern, who taught DNR hunter safety classes for 18 years, recalled that when he worked in the field in the mid-1990s he would see perhaps half a dozen hunters each season using an assault-style weapon. Toso -- who said he recently ended his longtime NRA membership in opposition to many of the group’s political messages -- called the percentage of gun deer hunters using weapons covered by the ban "tiny" at the time of the ban. (His association has not made an endorsement in the governor’s race.) And Smith said that from his experience, while firearms such as the AK-47 and the AR-15 "have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today and were an even smaller fraction in 1994." Our rating The NRA said Barrett voted to ban "a lot of common deer rifles." The statement holds an element of truth in that some deer hunters used some of the weapons. But the statement ignores facts that create a different impression. Experts agreed that the once-banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08562	Says Joe Sestak "voted to gut Medicare ... reducing benefits for 854,489 seniors" and jeopardizing "access to care for millions."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/28/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-ad-blasts-joe-sestak-vote-gut-medic/	Crossroads GPS, a deep-pocketed conservative advocacy group that has been running issue advertisements in a variety of key 2010 Congressional contests, recently produced an ad attacking Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., who's running for a Senate seat against former GOP Rep. Pat Toomey. The ad's narration begins, "Over half a million Pennsylvanians unemployed, and what's Congressman Joe Sestak done? He voted to gut Medicare, slashing benefits for Pennsylvania seniors. The Obama-Sestak scheme could jeopardize access to care for millions." In the visuals, the ad says, "Reducing benefits for 854,489 seniors," a statistic it attributes to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan group that studies health care policy. The ad also says on screen that Sestak "voted to cut Medicare by $500 billion," citing his vote in favor of the Democratic health care bill that was signed into law earlier this year by President Barack Obama. Focusing on seniors makes sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. So we thought we'd check to see whether the ad's claims about Medicare cuts were accurate. Initially, we were puzzled by the reference to "854,489 seniors," since it seemed like a remarkably specific number. When we contacted Crossroads GPS, a spokesman pointed us to a Kaiser Family Foundation database on Medicare Advantage, which is an option within Medicare -- the federal health care plan for Americans over 65 -- provided by private insurers. The Kaiser table shows that Crossroads GPS correctly cited the number of Pennsylvania seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage. That number accounts for nearly 39 percent of all Medicare enrollees in the Keystone State, which is higher than the national average of 25 percent. Because the ad focuses on Medicare Advantage, we'll begin with that facet of the new law. As we stated in a recent fact-check of a different ad, the Medicare Advantage program was intended to bring more private sector efficiency to the Medicare program. But the program's higher costs made it a prime target for architects of the new health care law. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission found that, on average, Medicare Advantage programs cost taxpayers 14 percent more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law phased out the extra payments Medicare Advantage programs were due to receive over the next three to six years, with the goal of bringing their costs in line with traditional Medicare. The changes were designed to save a projected $136 billion. Would these changes translate into "reducing benefits" for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, as the Crossroads GPS ad says? The cuts do put in jeopardy some of the more generous benefits that Medicare Advantage plans currently offer, such as dental and vision coverage, enhanced prescription drug coverage, coverage for the beneficiary's Medicare premiums and gym memberships. (The specific benefits differ by plan; indeed, variations in benefit packages are a major way that providers compete with each other for seniors.) "Many insurers are expected to stop participating in the program, while others will increase the premiums they charge seniors," said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute. On the other hand, the new law makes clear that Medicare Advantage providers cannot cut basic Medicare benefits -- just extra benefits that are not available to people getting traditional Medicare. This doesn't make the cuts any less real, but the ad, by not mentioning this context, might give viewers a skewed impression of the law's provisions. In addition, other parts of the new law expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the federal office that oversees Medicare -- announced last week that, on average, Medicare Advantage premiums will drop by 1 percent between 2010 and 2011. All of this suggests that there will probably be benefit cuts to Medicare Advantage programs but not to the core program. And the exact shape of these changes is not known yet. "It is not yet clear how plans will respond to payment reductions enacted in the health reform law, nor what these changes will mean for beneficiaries nationwide or in any given state," said Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So looking back at the ad's claims, do the Medicare Advantage changes "gut Medicare" or "jeopardize access to care for millions"? We think "gut" is an overheated way of putting it. There will likely be cuts to Medicare Advantage, but to suggest that these will eviscerate the program seems exaggerated, since basic benefits must be preserved. What about the possibility that the changes could "jeopardize access to care for millions"? Setting aside the fact that there are not "millions" of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in Pennsylvania, we'll acknowledge that there's a risk that some Medicare Advantage providers will look at their financial balance sheets and decide to pull out of the market. But Neuman said that Medicare beneficiaries have an average of 30 plans available to them in 2010 -- and if they can't find one they like, they can always sign up for regular Medicare. That doesn't seem to us like a situation in which access will be jeopardized. What if you assume that the ad was referring to Medicare as a whole (not just to Medicare Advantage) when it talked about gutting Medicare and jeopardizing access to care? Answering this question brings up the $500 billion cut referenced in the ad. The new law would indeed slow the rate of growth of the broader Medicare program by roughly that amount over 10 years. But it's not a slam-dunk that this represents a cut. The new law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it would slow the program's future growth over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- in fact, the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' non-partisan arbiter on such matters, projects that Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Such reductions could certainly squeeze future benefits, especially when inflation in the health care sector is taken into account. But once again, we feel that the use of the word "gut" and the notion that beneficiaries will find their access to care jeopardized amounts to an exaggeration. The changes in the new law "are not going to cause any hospital, and few other providers, to drop Medicare patients -- they couldn’t survive without them," said Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. So let's recap. The ad is on fairly safe ground in suggesting that Pennsylvania's 854,489 seniors on Medicare Advantage will see a decline in benefits, but it ignores the fact that no basic benefits will be cut. Meanwhile, the ad uses what we consider overheated language. The changes set in motion by the new law don't strike us, or several experts we spoke to, as ones that will "gut" the program or "jeopardize access to care for millions." So we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04624	Defends his vote to push "retirement age to 70" by saying he is for "a process" that would not be fully implemented until "around the turn of the century."	mostly false	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/17/scott-desjarlais/tennessee-congressman-defends-vote-raising-social-/	A central theme of Democratic challenger Eric Stewart’s campaign against 4th Congressional District incumbent Scott DesJarlais is the freshman’s support of House Republican budget plans and their impacts on Medicare and Social Security. DesJarlais has sought to downplay attacks against his votes for raising the age of eligibility for Social Security benefits by arguing that no change will affect anyone currently 55 or older. DesJarlais, a physician from South Pittsburg, Tenn., raised the issue on his own when he appeared on Nashville NewsChannel5’s weekly public affairs program "Inside Politics" on Aug. 17. He said: "I want to talk about the fact that the Paul Ryan plan helps save Medicare when the Democrat plan lets Medicare end. There’s a lot of misnomers out there. He wants to charge that we’re raising Social Security age to 70. Under the current structure, that happens sometime at the beginning of the next century." In an interview with The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro, DesJarlais said that "as far as this charge that I voted to raise the retirement age to 70, there’s a process where the retirement is pushed back by one month every two years, so by the time the retirement age hits 70, it’ll be sometime around the turn of the century." We can understand why a candidate treads carefully on Social Security. But there is no disputing this: On March 29, 2012, as the House was considering a series of Republican-sponsored budget reduction plans, DesJarlais voted for two separate GOP plans that would have major impacts on Social Security -- one which would have raised the eligibility age to 70 by 2048, or 52 years before the "turn of the century." Neither of the bills became law: The one that raised the retirement age to 70 in 2048 failed to pass the House and the other won House approval but never passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The first was a budget-reduction plan submitted by the Republican Study Committee, which calls itself "a group of House Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda." All of Tennessee’s Republican House members except Rep. John Duncan Jr. of Knoxville are RSC members and all of them except Duncan voted for the RSC plan. The RSC’s website describes its budget plan in full, including its proposal for "slowly increasing (Social Security’s) retirement age to 70 years…. For those born in 1978, the full-retirement age would remain at 70 years old." By our calculator, 1978 plus 70 is 2048 – more than five decades before the turn of the next century. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s analysis says: "Starting in 2023, the RSC budget proposes to increase the Social Security full retirement age by two months every year until it reaches age 70 in the year 2047. The RSC plan’s failure cleared the way later that day for House approval of a separate plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, now the GOP vice presidential candidate. The Ryan plan did not list specific changes for Social Security but required Social Security trustees to submit a stabilization plan to the President and for the President to submit a plan to Congress. DesJarlais also voted for that plan. In defending the accuracy of his statements, DesJarlais and his staff in essence contend that the Democrats have been attacking him for voting for the Ryan bill – which on March 29 did not contain a detailed provision for raising Social Security’s retirement age – and that that was what he was responding to with his "turn of the century" claim. His office pointed to an earlier, 2010 version of Ryan’s plan called "Road Map to America’s Future" that did include a detailed provision saying the Social Security. That plan says that "retirement age will gradually increase until it reaches 70 in the next century." An important note on that, however -- DesJarlais was not in Congress in 2010. He did not vote on that plan. DesJarlais’ statement on the matter says: "My statement regarding the time frame for raising social security is completely accurate when talking about Ryan’s budgetary roadmap, which has been the only budget that has been discussed and what I believed was being referred to." A review of Stewart’s website, including a web video, and media releases shows he has been talking about both the RSC plan and the Ryan budget plan. But a press release issued by Stewart’s campaign that says DesJarlais’ "turn of the century" claim "may be the falsity of the century" specifically refers to his vote for the RSC plan. Our ruling To defend himself against charges that he voted to raise the Social Security age to 70, the freshman congressman points to his support for Congressman Paul Ryan’s 2010 budgetary road map where the retirement age doesn’t hit 70 until the next century. But DesJarlais was not even in Congress in 2010, and the only vote he ever made on a plan that included a target date for raising the age to 70 came earlier this year.That plan called for raising Social Security age to 70 by 2047 or 2048 -- 52 years before the century turns. For that bit of misdirection, we give the congressman a ruling of Mostly False.	None	Scott DesJarlais	None	None	None	2012-09-17T04:00:00	2012-09-02	['None']
pomt-04571	Says Barack Obama has added $16 trillion to the national debt.	false	/texas/statements/2012/sep/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-has-added-16-trillion-federa/	Clarification, 5:34 p.m., Oct. 2, 2012: A reader alerted us to an error in the original version of this article, which incorrectly presented the figure for public debt as the level of intragovernmental debt and vice-versa. The article has been amended. The rating of the statement is unaffected. Gov. Rick Perry posted a photo the other day showing "$16 trillion" inked across the back of his hands. In a Sept. 20, 2012, Twitter post linking to the photo, Perry said: "Since @BarackObama has forgotten how much he's added to national debt #ForAll our kids to pay off." That day, the federal debt exceeded $16 trillion, according to the Treasury’s Debt to the Penny calculator. That total counted $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental debt and $11.3 trillion in public debt, money borrowed from outside the government. By email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us Perry’s tweet was reminding the president of the debt total "since he couldn’t seem to remember it a few days ago." She was referring to Obama’s Sept. 18, 2012, appearance on CBS-TV’s "Late Show with David Letterman." In the relevant segment, Letterman mentioned the live-action national debt clock featured at the Republican National Convention and asked Obama what it was about. Obama said factors feeding the debt included two wars not funded up front, renewed federal tax cuts and expenditures reacting to the financial crisis of 2008-09. Letterman, returning to the debt clock, then asked: "Now, do you remember what that number was? Was it $10 trillion?" "No," Obama replied, "I don’t remember what the number was, precisely.’" Asked if "we" should be scared by the rising debt, Obama said: "We don’t have to worry about it (the debt) short-term" due to low U.S. interest rates, though he called the debt a medium-to-long-term problem. Frazier’s email also said Obama has added about $5 trillion to the debt in less than four years. The increase since Obama became president in January 2009 is about $5.4 trillion, compared to the $10.6 trillion in debt on his inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009. While rating Mostly True a June 2012 claim by Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Paul Sadler that the national debt doubled while George W. Bush was president, we obtained a spreadsheet from Oregon State University political scientist Robert Sahr showing changes in the debt since 1940. Sahr later provided a chart showing changes in the public debt under each president since Harry Truman. We asked Frazier if Perry’s tweet was intended to saddle Obama with responsibility for all the debt. If "you want to split hairs, go right ahead," Frazier replied. "I've explained to you the intent behind the governor’s tweet... It is widely known that the national debt is" $16 trillion "and climbing and that is what the governor was referring to. At least he recognizes the real figure, while President Obama is either oblivious or chooses to ignore it." Our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin recently rated as False a claim by U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., that Obama had built "this $16 trillion debt." After that, PolitiFact Ohio rated as False a statement by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that the president "went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt." Both entities said the debt had grown to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses. Our rating We read Perry’s two-handed tweet as saying Obama has added $16 trillion to the national debt. But nearly two thirds of that unprecedented total accumulated before Obama became president. To be fair, too, changes in the debt cannot be laid on any president alone. Actions by members of both parties, over years, helped build the debt. We rate Perry’s statement as False.

pomt-05663	An independent payment advisory board created by the health care reform law "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/19/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-health-care-advisory-board-can-rati/	Pat Boone gained fame in the 1950s with covers of tunes like "Tutti Frutti," "Long Tall Sally," and "Ain’t That a Shame." Now he’s helping the 60 Plus Association, an advocacy group that bills itself as "the conservative alternative" to the AARP, to recycle material. Boone is the pitchman in an ad that targets the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, the health reform bill often called Obamacare approved by Congress in 2010. The ad warns seniors of potential dangers in the bill and urges them to call Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. The 60 Plus Association announced it was launching a new campaign on March 12 that would target five Democratic senators, including Brown, on the issue of health care reform. The centerpiece of the new, $720,000 ad campaign in Ohio, 60 Plus said, is a 60-second spot featuring Boone. In addition to the spot that targets Brown, the campaign also is airing look-alike ads aimed at Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Bill Nelson of Florida, Jon Tester of Montana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. If the ad looks familiar, it should. It's the same TV spot, recycling a series of claims about the health care reform law, that was part of a $750,000 campaign that 60 Plus aimed at Brown four months ago. Since the ad is again airing in Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at another one of its claims: that the independent payment advisory board created by the Affordable Care Act "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments." First though, we’ll touch on some of the ad’s other statements. In the ad, Boone says that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will cut $500 billion from Medicare. PolitiFact has reviewed that claim several times and rated it Mostly False. A review of the claim from an earlier 60 Plus ad noted, "the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, it attempts to slow the program’s future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase - the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009." Boone also claims in the ad that the law creates "a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare to pay for new government programs." PolitiFact Ohio found that so puzzling and ridiculous that we rated it Pants on Fire. But what about this claim, that the IPAB "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments"? The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act creates the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board to suggest ways to limit Medicare’s spending growth. It can be overruled by Congress. Its appointments will be done in public. It will not make decisions on individual cases. The board can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, co-insurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. In the ad, Boone says that the IPAB would "operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy." Rep. Michelle Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and former presidential candidate, earned a False rating from PolitiFact when she made some similar claims in a debate in October 2011. The board's members won’t be "bureaucrats," as the ad states. The health care law requires they will be doctors and medical professionals, economists and health care management experts, and representatives for consumers and seniors. Boone charges that "this IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments" and that the board decides "whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy" and "will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." But the IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual. They would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given Boone’s rhetoric, some people could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case. Experts agreed that the board has no say in whether any individual receives dialysis, chemotherapy or any other treatment. It is barred by Section 3403 of the health care law from making policy recommendations that would block patients from needed care. "The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Energy and Commerce Committee last July. "And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress," she said. "If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it’s Congress’s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path." That’s not at all what Boone croons in the 60 Plus ad. His claim that IPAB "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments" isn’t just wrong. It’s also ridiculous. To that we can say "Ain’t That a Shame." On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Pants on Fire.	None	Pat Boone	None	None	None	2012-03-19T06:00:00	2012-03-11	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-01854	Says "nothing" in Obama’s $3.7 billion request to address the child immigrant situation "actually secures the border."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/14/steve-king/rep-steve-king-says-obamas-37-billion-plan-regardi/	With more than 52,000 undocumented immigrant children from Central America arriving at the southern border of the United States, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans have sparred over exactly how to proceed. Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to address the problem, but leading Republicans have expressed skepticism about the budget request and what it would be put toward. How much will be spent taking care of children now on U.S. soil, and how much will go to securing the border from future illegal crossings? On July 10, 2014, Fox news host Bill O’Reilly interviewed Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, about Obama’s request. "I'm not going to vote to approve $3.7 billion for the president to hire more lawyers and to squander in a way that he has designed," King said. "There is nothing in this that actually secures the border. And until we stop the bleeding at the border, Bill, we are not going to solve this problem." Is King -- one of Congress’ most vocal critics of illegal immigration -- right that there is nothing in Obama’s plan that would help secure the border? We took a closer look. First, some background. The White House’s July 8 supplemental budget request is designed to respond to the current crisis, but it is also supposed to support "a sustained border security surge through enhanced domestic enforcement." How does Obama propose to do that? Here’s what the administration says it intends to spend the money on: • $1.8 billion for basic necessities like food and shelter for unaccompanied immigrant children; • $897 million for judicially processing and deporting undocumented families; • $364 million for other administrative processing related to the surge in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families; • $295 million for the reintegration of migrants to countries in Central America; • $109 million for expanding immigration and customs investigations and enforcement; • $45.4 million for additional immigration judges to increase case processing; • $39 million to increase air surveillance of the Rio Grande region; • $29 million for expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program; • $15 million for direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings; • $5 million for public programs and support related to Central American migration issues; • $2.5 million for expansion of the legal orientation program; • $1.1 million for additional immigration litigation attorneys. Separately, the bill includes $615 million for wildfire suppression, which is unrelated to the immigration situation. Looking at this list, King has a point that a lot of the money is going toward lawyers and legal services. Still, it’s not everything. (King’s office did not respond to our requests for comment.) Several experts told PolitiFact that a number of these budgetary line items would qualify as addressing border security. A clear item is the $39 million for aerial surveillance, which is designed to spot people coming across the border. Other items include the boost for the Border Enforcement Security Task Force ($29 million) and investigatory efforts that would investigate smuggling operations ($109 million). Some would also count a portion of a much larger item -- the $897 million for judicially processing and deporting undocumented families. Christopher Wilson, a senior associate of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, said much of this money would go for the detention, prosecution and removal of undocumented families. Even though it’s not happening literally on the border, he said, it’s part of enforcing the border security laws. In addition, some of the $364 million line item for administrative processing would likely be used for overtime and temporary-duty costs for current Border Patrol agents, said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Wilson Center’s Latin America program. So, depending on how you categorize the money, at least $177 million and possibly up to $1 billion could be categorized as funds for securing the border. Even at the high end of the estimate, though, the amount spent on securing the border would amount to less than one-third of the total. The majority would go toward taking care of immigrants who recently arrived at the border, particularly the $1.8 billion allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for children who are already here. (And of course the $615 for wildfire suppression is not connected to immigration.) We should note that the administration has indicated that its intent with the supplemental spending request is not to implement a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Rather, the request is intended to alleviate the immediate humanitarian situation. Wilson added that while beefing up surveillance and patrol personnel might curb some illegal immigration, it is not a solution to the immediate problem of children coming from Central American countries, Wilson said. These Central American children actually seek out American officials rather than trying to evade them, so adding more boots on the ground would not turn them away, he said. This is because the current law, passed under former President George W. Bush, allows children from countries that don’t border the United States to stay in the country if they are victims of trafficking. "The idea that having more border enforcement would be a solution to this crisis is a fallacy," Wilson said, "They’re not trying to sneak past Border Patrol -- they’re turning themselves into Border Patrol." Our ruling King said there is "nothing" in Obama’s $3.7 billion request to address the child immigration situation "that actually secures the border." King has a point that a majority of the funding request would cover basic necessities for children crossing the border as well as additional resources for the legal process. But somewhere between $177 million and possibly as much as $1 billion of the total request would be spent on items that can be described as aiding efforts to secure the border. Because this is not a trivial amount, King is wrong to say it’s "nothing." On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False. Correction: The White House's supplemental budget request was made July 8. Our report initially gave an earlier date.	None	Steve King	None	None	None	2014-07-14T11:47:24	2014-07-10	['None']
pomt-09974	Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch could "end up giving Republicans the ability to filibuster judicial nominees at the Judiciary Committee level so that the nominees never get out of committee."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/05/rush-limbaugh/rush-right-about-judiciary-committee-rules/	Rush Limbaugh speculated recently that Sen. Arlen Specter's switch to the Democratic Party wouldn't necessarily be a boon to Democrats when it comes time for Supreme Court nominations. "The conventional wisdom was that Arlen Specter defecting to the Democrats put them close to a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate which would allow Obama to just skate through his agenda," Limbaugh said on his radio show May 1. "And on most subjects, it appears to be true. However, Specter's defection may actually end up giving Republicans the ability to filibuster judicial nominees at the Judiciary Committee level so that the nominees never get out of committee. Now, these are big 'if's, but it's possible." Limbaugh cited a legal blog, Dorf on Law , as his source on the matter. Law professor Michael Dorf wrote that the Senate Judiciary Committee has a rule that one member of the minority party must agree for a matter to be brought to a vote. Otherwise the matter will not be voted on. Dorf is a law professor at Cornell University and a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. We confirmed the Senate Judiciary Committee's rule that the blog cited. Rule IV states, "The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is objection to bring the matter to a vote without further debate, a roll call vote of the Committee shall be taken, and debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the affirmative, one of which must be cast by the minority." We should note that this is not a filibuster, which is a tactic used on the Senate floor to prevent a vote by refusing to stop debating. It was immortalized in the movie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in which Jimmy Stewart portrays a senator who filibusters to save his reputation. He eventually collapses in exhaustion . These days, the threat of filibuster is usually enough to stop legislation on the Senate floor until supporters can muster the 60 votes needed to overcome it. But Rule IV is a way of refusing to allow a measure to get a committee vote. Typically, though, there has been great reluctance to bottle up nominations like this. A Senate staff member referred us to a 2001 letter signed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and then senior Republican Orrin Hatch. (Leahy is still chairman; the new top GOP member is Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama.) The letter states, "The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee. We both recognize and have every intention of following the practices and precedents of the Committee and the Senate when considering Supreme Court nominees." Limbaugh conceded that using Rule IV would be controversial. "Now, folks, admittedly this is a bit of a long shot because this is going to require that the Republicans have the fortitude to even do this, to even try it; 'cause if they did — if they essentially filibustered the vote in the Judiciary Committee — the media is going to be all over these things," he said. "I mean, nuclear ammo is gonna rain down on these guys if they try it. But it's possible." But we wondered if using this Rule IV would be the end of the story. To find out, we turned to one of the Senate's official historians, Donald Ritchie. He said that both the House and the Senate have rules that allow them to pull matters out of committee, even when the committee refuses to vote on a measure. The rules usually require that the matter lay over for one day, but then the body can take up the matter that the committee failed to address. "It's not 100 percent on either side. It's not easy for the majority, but it's not impossible either," he said. "Nothing is easy in the Senate. I don't make any predictions." It's also important to note that a nominee can get a failing vote from a committee, and then still be approved by the full Senate. A prominent example of this is when President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Henry Wallace to be secretary of commerce in 1945. The Senate committee voted against the nomination, but the full Senate then voted on the matter and approved his nomination, Ritchie said. Limbaugh is right about the existence of the committee rule and its potential effects. He admits it's a longshot. But it's not a filibuster in committee in the way that the rule works. And unlike the classic filibuster, the Rule IV move could likely be overcome by the full Senate. But at its core, Limbaugh is right it's a possible maneuver for the Republican minority. We rule Limbaugh's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14898	"Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind California."	false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/06/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-embarrassed-says-californians-buying-m/	Greg Abbott is embarrassed? So the Texas governor said in this October 2015 tweet: "I'm EMBARRASSED: Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA. Let's pick up the pace Texans." Can’t be right. Right? It wasn’t. Abbott’s tweet linked to a news blog post in which the Houston Chronicle reported that while the number of requests to buy firearms in Texas had topped 1 million for the year, the Lone Star State still trailed California in such requests, according to the FBI. The post drew on FBI counts, all right, but the agency doesn’t track the number of firearms purchased in each state. When we asked spokesman Stephen Fischer about such detail, he emailed us a link to the agency web page tallying requests made by firearms dealers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check system known as NICS to determine whether a person should be disqualified from buying a gun based on a range of matters, such as prior criminal history to mental health. A footnote to the chart says: "These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale." That’s a big caveat. Background checks in 2015 Still, let’s see how the requests for instant background checks have been stacking up. From January through October 2015, the most background checks were submitted from Kentucky — 2.6 million such requests. California was next, with 1.3 million, and then Texas, with nearly 1.2 million checks. Adjusting for population We recognized another way to evaluate how each of the 10 states with the most requests for background checks stack up: Adjust for population. Drawing on U.S. census estimates of each state’s population as of July 2014, we found that Kentucky led nationally through the first 10 months of 2015 by generating nearly 0.6 requests for background checks per resident. States lagging far behind included Alabama and Indiana (0.1 requests per resident); Tennessee, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio (less than 0.1 requests per resident) and Texas and Florida (0.04 requests per resident). We found California ranking last in this subgroup (0.03 requests per resident). Guns purchased without background checks A wrinkle: Any estimate of gun purchases by state is hindered by the unknown number of private purchases or gifts of guns not preceded by background checks. A 1997 study occasionally is invoked to suggest 40 percent of gun sales don’t involve background checks. That’s not a correct reading of the study, PolitiFact has noted. Also, one of the researchers has since said it’s not known how many purchases occur without background checks. We asked Abbott’s office about his claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Abbott said: "Texas #2 in nation for new gun purchases, behind CALIFORNIA." Hold fire: The FBI counsels against using requests for instant background checks to estimate gun purchases, which was Abbott’s basis for his statement. Besides that, Texas ranked third behind Kentucky and California in the number of checks requested for gun purchases through the first 10 months of 2015. Adjust for population and among the 10 states with the most requested background checks, Texas tied with Florida for 8th place with both states and seven others accounting for more per-capita requests for background checks than California. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10909	"Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/01/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-defense-budget/	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist who beat incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in a New York primary race, has some ideas on how to finance programs that she supports, such as Medicare for All. In a recent interview with the Daily Show’s Trevor Noah, she said Congress should cut frivolous defense spending to pay for a wider social safety net. "Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for," Ocasio-Cortez said July 26. "They were like, we don’t want another fighter jet! Don’t give us another nuclear bomb. They didn’t even ask for it. And we gave it to them." Did the military get a $700 billion dollar raise — that they didn’t even ask for? First off, Ocasio-Cortez fudged the figures, which her campaign acknowledged in an email. Congress gave the military a $61 billion increase from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. The total military budget for 2018 was $700 billion. That includes the Department of Defense and elements of other agencies, chiefly Energy Department programs pertaining to nuclear weapons. For 2018, that’s more money than President Donald Trump’s budget requested (roughly $668 billion). The 2019 spending level, $716 billion, is exactly what Trump requested. Through its Office of Management and Budget, the White House negotiates with the Defense Department to determine a budget. But settling at a lower number doesn’t mean military leaders don’t want more money, said Susanna Blume, senior fellow of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. In addition to the budget, each military branch (Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force) submits an annual list to Congress of items they want but were not able to include in the annual budget request for perceived lack of budgetary wiggle room. That wish list would have pushed the budget request to $700 billion in 2018. When Defense Secretary James Mattis testified before the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 6, 2018, he echoed that request. (The fiscal year 2018 budget became law March 23.) "Failure to modernize our military risks leaving us with a force that could dominate the last war but be irrelevant to tomorrow's security," Mattis said. "We need Congress to lift the defense spending caps and support the budget for our military of $700 billion for this fiscal year and $716 billion for next fiscal year." Obama usually requested more money than Congress granted (unlike Trump, whose proposed 2018 budget was upped by Congress). But Blume said it’s not unusual for things to shake out in this way, either. Our ruling Ocasio-Cortez said, "Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for." That’s the total defense budget for 2018, which marks an increase in $61 billion from 2017. (Her campaign acknowledged this point.) It is more than the Defense Department settled in negotiations for Trump’s budget request ($668 billion), but exactly what they requested in their annual wishlist to Congress.

pomt-04523	Rhode Island’s voter identification law was pushed by "a black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate. That's a fact."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/03/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-rhode-islands-voter-identificatio/	Usually, as Election Day draws closer, it’s the candidates who get more and more scrutiny. But one of the new wrinkles in American politics in 2012 has been not just the fight over who is running, but who will be voting. Over the past few years, several states have enacted voter-identification laws that Republicans claim will help prevent voter fraud and Democrats claim will disenfranchise poor and minority -- and mostly Democratic -- voters. Rhode Island’s 2011 voter-identification law has become a bit player in that debate. Republican commentators regularly cite it to push back against the partisan accusations, noting that the law was passed by the overwhelmingly Democratic Rhode Island General Assembly. And that’s exactly what conservative pundit Ann Coulter did Thursday on ABC’s "The View." When View cohost Joy Behar suggested voter-identification legislation seemed aimed at the poor and minorities, Coulter was ready. "One of the first states in the union to pass voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature," she said. "And who pushed it? A black Democrat in the house, a black Democrat in the senate. That's a fact!" We look at Coulter’s one-of-the-first claim in a separate item; here we examine the claims of minority legislative support. And the facts show Coulter is right. In the Rhode Island Senate, the bill’s main sponsor was Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, an African-American. The House version was co-sponsored by House Speaker Gordon Fox, the first black lawmaker to lead the state lower chamber, among others. Further, the bill got a crucial boost when state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence, who is of African -American and Panamanian descent, also supported it. She testified about how she suspected someone had voted in her name in 2006 (no complaint was filed) and how she’d once seen a man vote twice at her local polling place. Their support came despite aggressive lobbying against the bill by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union, Ocean State Action and the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights. It passed the House 54 to 21 and the Senate 27 to 6, with five not voting. Our ruling Ann Coulter said the voter-identification passed by the Rhode Island legislature was pushed by black senators and representatives. In fact, in both the House and the Senate, black legislators strongly supported the bill. We rule her statement True.

pomt-04058	Under President Barack Obama, "8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/25/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-under-president-barack-obama-83-/	During the Jan. 22, 2013, edition of his Fox News show, Sean Hannity introduced an interview segment with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., by noting that during his second inauguration, President Barack Obama barely mentioned the primary topic of the 2012 presidential election -- the economy. After playing some excerpts from Obama’s inaugural speech, Hannity said, "While Obama remains hell-bent on tackling national security threats like climate change, the president made no substantive references to economic matters like putting you the American people back to work." Then, welcoming McCarthy to the show, Hannity said, "8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago. What is your reaction to that?" (Hannity actually inadvertently failed to say the word "million," but in context, it was clear what he meant, so we won’t let that affect our ruling.) We wondered whether it was really true that "8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago." There’s an easy way to find out. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on the number of Americans who are employed at any given time. Using their figures for total, nonfarm employment, there were 358,000 fewer people working in December 2012 than there were in December 2008 -- a far cry from 8.3 million. So by this standard -- and we believe it’s the correct one to use in this context -- Hannity is flat wrong. But the 8.3 million figure, which has been a hot topic in conservative circles recently, has a grain of truth to it. Hannity’s primary problem was sloppy phrasing. He referred to 8.3 million "fewer Americans … working today," but he would have been on firmer ground if he’d said that "8.3 million more Americans are not working today" compared to four years ago. That may sound like a distinction without a difference, but it’s not. Actually, it’s crucial. What’s at issue here are the number of Americans who have left the workforce during the past four years. The most frequently discussed economic statistics don’t do a very good job documenting these workers, and why they make that decision. For instance, a worker may have a baby and leave to become a stay-at-home mom or dad. Or a recent college grad may detour into grad school. Some of these decisions may have happened anyway, regardless of the state of the job market. But some may decide to raise a child or go to grad school because the job market is poor. Let’s look at where the 8.3 million figure emerged -- in an article in CNSNews.com, a conservative outlet. (The Fox News press office did not respond to an inquiry.) The article starts with BLS data for the number of Americans aged 16 and older, then subtracts the number who are employed. What’s left refers to the number of Americans who are "not working" at any given time, for any reason. We did our own calculation for the December 2008 to December 2012 time frame and found that CNSNews had actually understated the count. By our count, the number of Americans not working increased by almost 9.6 million. Still, let’s not get ahead of ourselves -- this number isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, either. Specifically, it’s a big stretch to tie this increase to Obama, as Hannity clearly does based on his introductory video clips and comments. Why? • A big reason for the rise in non-working Americans is the graying of the Baby Boom generation, something Obama has no control over. We looked at Census Bureau data to estimate the population of Americans aged 65 or more. There is no data for 2012, so we used the increase in the 65-and-over population from 2007 to 2011 instead. (Given demographic trends, the increase through 2012 would likely be higher, but we’ll stick with the hard numbers.) We found that the population aged 65 and over rose by 3.1 million between 2007 and 2011. So, 3.1 million of the 9.6 million more non-working Americans are due in large part to the aging of the population. That leaves a rise of roughly 6.5 million Americans that might, theoretically, be attributable to Obama and the economy he presided over. That number, 6.5 million, is lower than Hannity’s 8.3 million, but it’s still pretty big. (To its credit, CNSNews offered a similar reduction using Social Security beneficiary data, lowering the number of non-workers under Obama to about 4.1 million -- though readers who saw the headline or skimmed the story likely would have missed it.) But there’s another important factor to consider: • The number of non-workers has been growing since well before Obama entered office. To determine how different the economy was under Obama, you have to have a sense of what it was like before he became president. So we did exactly the same calculations for the four-year period immediately before he took office – December 2004 to December 2008, under President George W. Bush. In the 2004-08 period, the number of non-working Americans rose by 7.2 million and the number of elderly rose (between 2003 and 2007) by 1.8 million. So the rise of non-workers not attributable to the elderly was 5.4 million. This means the increase in non-workers was indeed bigger under Obama – there were more than 1 million extra non-workers under Obama than under Bush -- but the increase was quite a bit smaller than one would think from hearing Hannity’s comment. Experts say that this is an important statistic to be concerned about, though they also caution that it’s hard, if not impossible, to know what portion of these 1 million extra non-workers stems from Obama’s policies. We don’t know, after all, to what extent those leaving the job market are doing so because the economy is poor as opposed to other, more personal reasons. "The idea of more Americans not working is a valid and interesting concept -- economists have been worried about this," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "There is clearly a downtrend in labor force participation. The question is how much of this would have happened without the recession -- or with different policies, or whatever the comparison is -- versus how much is long term trends, which we may or may not want to target with policies and may simply be due to demographics" or changing attitudes. Our ruling Hannity said that under President Barack Obama, "8.3 (million) fewer Americans are working today than there were four years ago." That’s simply wrong; the actual decrease in working Americans over that period was less than one-twentieth that amount. There is reason to be concerned about a related, but distinct, statistic -- that there are perhaps 8 million or 9 million more Americans than there were four years ago who are not working, for a variety of reasons. But that number is heavily affected by the graying of the Baby Boom generation and by long-term patterns that have nothing to do with Obama -- and in any case, it’s not what Hannity said. We rate Hannity’s claim False.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2013-01-25T17:48:09	2013-01-20	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-05325	There are "49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-there-are-49-different-federal-jo/	During a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on May 16, 2012, Mitt Romney said he intended to make government work better and save money in the process. As an example, he cited the federal government’s efforts to provide job training. "Do you know how many federal job training programs there are? 49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies," he said. Romney said he would look to consolidate programs and send them to the states. "I want to take those dollars, put them together and give them to the state of Florida and say, ‘You create the program that’s best for your own people, that puts people to work.’ " We had never heard that there were "49 different federal jobs programs," so we decided to check it out. Our research eventually led us to independent reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a respected independent agency that investigates how the federal government spends money. The Romney campaign pointed us to the GAO as well. The agency conducted a thorough study on job training programs run by the federal government and published its findings in 2011. (The report studied fiscal year 2009.) The GAO concluded that the federal government had 47 programs run by nine different agencies, numbers very close to what Romney said. In later reports, the agency recommended that Congress look into streamlining the programs by combining administrative functions and locating different programs together at a single site. The GAO also noted that more information is needed to measure the true effectiveness of the programs. "Almost all of the 47 programs tracked multiple outcome measures related to employment and training, and the most frequently tracked outcome measure was ‘entered employment,’ " the agency stated. "However, little is known about the effectiveness of employment and training programs because, since 2004, only five reported conducting an impact study, and about half of all the remaining programs have not had a performance review of any kind." We should note that 47 programs sounds like a lot, but it doesn’t necessarily mean programs can be combined. It might not make sense, for example, to combine the "Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program" with the "Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Program," or the "Native American Employment and Training Program" with the "National Guard Youth Challenge Program." Finally, the 47 programs are not equal in size or scope. The GAO reported that seven programs accounted for 75 percent of the $18 billion spent on job training, while two programs ("Wagner- Peyser funded Employment Service" and "Workforce Investment Act Adult") served about 77 percent of all participants. Our ruling Romney said that there are "49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies." The most recent comprehensive report we found on the matter found 47 job training programs under nine agencies. Also, a smaller subset of agencies account for a majority of spending on job training and number of people served. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02430	Says Rick Scott "oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/03/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-rick-scott-oversaw-largest-medicare-fra/	First, Gov. Rick Scott scared the bejesus out of seniors with an online ad claiming that Medicare rate cuts would lead them to lose access to their doctors, hospitals and preventive care. Then, the Florida Democratic Party fired back at Scott, issuing a press release that called Scott "the ultimate Medicare thief." The Democrats were referring to Scott’s prior tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA about a decade ago, when the hospital company was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. "Rick Scott is saying Democrats are committing Medicare robbery, when in fact he's the ultimate Medicare thief. He lost the right to accuse Democrats of raiding Medicare when he oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history. Rick Scott's company stole money that should have gone to health care for seniors," said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp in the Feb. 25 press release. Separately, we have fact-checked Scott’s claim "we are seeing dramatic rate cuts" to Medicare that will affect people's choice of doctor, hospital and preventive care. We concluded that Scott had failed to say that the rate cut only applies to Medicare Advantage, and thus only affects a fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries. Also, it could be several months before we know the actual impact of the cut which could vary county by county. We rated Scott's claim Mostly False. Here, we’ll fact-check the Democratic counter-attack that Scott "oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history." Scott’s tenure at Columbia/HCA During Scott’s 2010 race for governor, PolitiFact fact-checked multiple claims related to his tenure at Columbia/HCA. Now, we’ll recap some of our earlier discussion of the investigation and fine. Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he would add hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud -- if only "somebody told me something was wrong." But there were such warnings in the company’s annual public reports to stockholders -- which Scott had to sign as president and CEO. Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: • Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians; • The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; • The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education; • Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion. On Scott’s 2010 campaign website, he admitted to the $1.7 billion fine, though the link is no longer on the site. What type of record was that fine? The fine clearly set a record, though the Justice Department (and media reports at the time) were not always consistent in their terminology, sometimes describing it as the "largest government fraud settlement in U.S. History" and other times more specifically as the "largest health care fraud case in U.S. History." A Justice Department spokeswoman said that officials refer to Columbia/HCA as "largest health care fraud" rather than the more narrow term "Medicare fraud" because it involved defrauding other government programs such as Medicaid rather than Medicare exclusively. The Justice Department described in detail the various ways the company defrauded Medicare and other government health programs here. Here’s a key point, though: While the Columbia/HCA settlement was a record at the time for health care fraud, it has since been surpassed. In cases related to the improper promotion of certain drugs, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a a $2.2 billion settlement in 2013, Pfizer settled for $2.3 billion in 2009, and GlaxoSmithKline settled for $3 billion in 2012. "HCA was the record health care fraud at the time. It’s now Glaxo," Justice Department spokeswoman Linda Mansour told PolitiFact in an email. That said, these cases were a little different. While the Justice Department’s case against Columbia/HCA repeatedly mentions overbilling and defrauding Medicare and Medicaid specifically, the three newer cases focused on the marketing of drugs, with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs caught up in the impropriety, rather than being the specific targets of the fraud. Because the Justice Department press releases explaining the settlements don’t explicitly break down how much of the misconduct in those more recent cases defrauded Medicare explicitly, it’s difficult to make comparisons. The Pfizer case includes violations relating to misbranding and kickbacks, "so there may be a distinction to be made for that reason when thinking about whether it all should be classified under the very general category of ‘Medicare fraud,’ " said Asha Scielzo, who practices health care law at the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The Columbia/HCA case "still is the largest fraud settlement for a hospital corporation in U.S. history," since all the others involved pharmaceutical firms, added Zack Buck, a health care law professor at Mercer. "So I guess, the quote (by the Florida Democratic Party) is a little loose." The Scott campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check. However in 2010, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times, "There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader." Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott "oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history." The Columbia/HCA settlement has since been surpassed in dollar value, though the bigger cases involved Medicare somewhat less directly. Because the Democratic Party could have been a bit more specific in its wording -- by saying that Scott oversaw the largest Medicare fraud at the time -- we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fcf7f511-cd67-45a3-90da-1b8284f049c1	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2014-03-03T16:38:27	2014-02-25	['None']
pomt-03028	Louie Gohmert of Texas "blamed the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado on ‘the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.'"	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/10/gail-collins/texas-congressman-mentioned-attacks-christian-beli/	In her Oct. 3, 2013, oped column, Gail Collins of the New York Times referred to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler as among a couple dozen "unhinged" House Republicans keeping the government from being funded unless the Obamacare law is unplugged. Collins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, "who blamed the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado on ‘the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’" By email, Collins’ research aide, Isabella Moschen, said Collins’ reference to Gohmert blaming the Colorado shootings on attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs traced to a CBS News report posted online the day of the shootings July 20, 2012, headlined: "GOP Rep. links shooting to ‘attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’" The story said that in a radio interview that day, Gohmert had associated the mass shooting with "attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs." The story said he made the comment on "Istook Live!", a program produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Initially, CBS News said, the show’s host, Ernest Istook, asked Gohmert, "What is your experience with the way that we have too many twisted minds in our society?" Gohmert responded: "Some of us happen to believe that when our founders talked about guarding our virtue and freedom, that that was important. Whether it's John Adams saying our Constitution was made only for moral and religious people... Ben Franklin, only a virtuous people are capable of freedom, as nations become corrupt and vicious they have more need of masters... We have been at war with the very pillars, the very foundation of this country." The congressman then said: "And... what really gets me as a Christian is to see the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs and then some senseless crazy act of a derelict takes place." A web link in the CBS News story led us to audio of the interview as posted that day by the Huffington Post. According to the recording, after Gohmert’s mention of Judeo-Christian beliefs, the show’s host replied: "Now in this case, we don’t know much about the individual…" Gohmert said: "Don’t misunderstand my statement by saying it’s terror. I’m not saying that at all. It could be anybody. We know that. ...But it is a terror act when you go in and start terrorizing people like this, no matter what your background is." The host said the attack wouldn’t have to have been by an Islamic terrorist. "Right," Gohmert said, before criticizing attempts he described as keeping God from being invoked at an off-campus school event in Florida. "I mean, that kind of stuff? Where is God? Well, what have we done with God?" Gohmert said. "We’ve told him we don’t want him around. And I kind of like his protective hand being present." We asked Gohmert about Collins’ claim and didn’t hear back. We noticed, though, that his House office issued a Gohmert statement later July 20, 2012, stating in part: "This tragedy is not only heartbreaking –it is incomprehensible." The congressman’s response was accompanied by his transcript of the Istook interview. Gohmert prefaced his statement by saying: "Some of my comments in this interview have been taken out of context." Separately, we asked Collins if she had other evidence of Gohmert blaming attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs for the shootings. Moschen replied by email that Collins’ reference to Gohmert laying such blame was a "fair comment." Our ruling Collins said Gohmert "blamed the mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado on ‘the ongoing attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs.’" On the day of the shootings, Gohmert aired concern about attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs and referred, in the same breath, to the shootings. He also said later that day that some of his comments were taken out of context. We agree. Gohmert reflected on attacks on Judeo-Christian beliefs, but did not blame the shootings on such attacks. We rate Collins’ claim, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-03761	A new law "requires the USDA to approve the harvest and sale of crops from genetically modified seed even if a court has ruled against the crop as being dangerous to public safety or the environment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/05/facebook-posts/group-says-monsanto-law-skirts-courts-requires-app/	Have you heard of the Monsanto Protection Act? That’s the name critics have assigned to a section of the continuing resolution which Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed on March 20, 2013, that keeps the federal government operating through the end of the fiscal year. Tucked into Section 735 of the law is a provision relating to the regulation of genetically engineered crops that has food safety activists up in arms. We’ve seen a number of claims about this legislation, on Facebook in particular. This one, from the group Grow Food, Not Lawns, caught our eye: The law "requires the USDA to approve the harvest and sale of crops from genetically modified seed even if a court has ruled against the crop as being dangerous to public safety or the environment." That’s a hefty statement about a hot issue. We decided to look further. Sugar beets and the regulatory process Missouri-based Monsanto is the world’s largest producer of genetically engineered seeds, which are regulated by the USDA. The agency is required, under the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA, to study them for environmental impacts, such as their effect on other crops and their risk of becoming a pest plant. (The USDA does not assess the seeds in terms of food safety -- that’s the job of the FDA and is not addressed in this law.) This process landed in court in 2009, when Monsanto petitioned for approval of a sugar beet genetically engineered to be resistant to a Monsanto brand of herbicide. The USDA conducted a preliminary environmental study that found that the beet’s introduction into agriculture would have no significant impact on the environment and gave its approval. The Center for Food Safety sued USDA, saying it had not completed an adequate NEPA review, and the courts agreed, sending USDA back to complete the study. It’s important to note that the court ruling didn’t say the beets were unsafe; it simply said that an adequate environmental review hadn’t been done. "It took USDA more than a year to do the analysis, but farmers were growing these sugar beets," said Greg Jaffe with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "USDA issued temporary permits while they continued the analysis, with conditions to ensure it didn’t impact the environment. They had the discretion to do that." Ultimately, Jaffe said, USDA finished its study and approved the crop. So, what’s new? The attachment in the budget bill, known as a "rider," essentially puts into law the practice described in the sugar beet case. "The language in Section 735 codifies existing USDA authority and elements of a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that lower courts should not automatically prohibit the planting of biotech crop varieties, or the harvest and sale of biotech crops already planted, if/when their commercial use is temporarily banned because of a lawsuit," said Karen Batra, spokeswoman for the Biotech Industry Organization. "This applies to products that have ALREADY gone through the approval process and already been deregulated by FDA and therefore deemed to be safe for human health and the environment. If the secretary believes that the crop at issue poses a risk in any way, he can forbid its use." Jaffe added, "I don’t think it provides USDA with any new legal authority that they didn’t already have, although clearly it’s Congress telling USDA that they should use that authority wherever possible." The text of the law says "In the event that a determination of nonregulated status made pursuant to section 411 of the Plant Protection Act is or has been invalidated or vacated, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by a farmer, grower, farm operator, or producer, immediately grant temporary permit(s) or temporary deregulation..." The words -- "shall immediately grant" -- are alarming activists who are already suspicious of genetically modified products dominating the food supply. "It goes a step beyond by forcing the agency to approve those permits or partial deregulation," said Colin O’Neil, director of government affairs at the Center for Food Safety, the group that filed suit in the sugar beet case. "There’s an urgency written into the law that is going to stifle sound science and science-based regulation." "It kind of takes the courts out of the game," added Patty Lovera of the group Food and Water Watch. Jaffe, however, noted that the USDA would still have to adhere to existing guidelines in the approval process, such as ensuring that products comply with the Plant Protection Act. When we contacted the USDA about this claim, a spokesman sent us this statement: "(Agriculture) Secretary (Tom) Vilsack has asked the Office of General Counsel to review this provision as it appears to pre-empt judicial review of a deregulatory action, which may make the provision unenforceable." Our ruling The group Grow Food, Not Lawns claimed that the budget bill "requires the USDA to approve the harvest and sale of crops from genetically modified seed even if a court has ruled against the crop as being dangerous to public safety or the environment." We learned from experts that the USDA issuing temporary permits for products in litigation is not new with this law. That was already the agency’s practice. And in the sugar beet case that went to court, the dispute was not over the safety of the food but the environmental review procedure. However, the language in the law saying the USDA "shall" issue permits escalates that policy, with one expert telling us it "compels" the agency to allow the use of disputed products while litigation proceeds. And now the USDA itself is now questioning whether that provision is enforceable. The Facebook claim rightly describes the effect of the new provision, but lacks some important context. We rate it Half True. Editor's note: This story has been changed after publication to clarify that Monsanto created a sugar beet that was resistant to an herbicide.

pomt-05796	"When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted 'no'."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/24/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-claims-dennis-kucinich-voted-no-new-m/	Congressional redistricting in Ohio has left two veteran incumbents, Dennis Kucinich and Marcy Kaptur, facing each other in an increasingly tense Democratic primary. Kucinich used his opening remarks in a recent debate at the City Club in Cleveland to challenge Kaptur over a TV ad that he said misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors. PolitiFact Ohio took a look and found that the 30-second ad, titled "No," does make three statements about Kucinich's record. We'll examine them in separate items, starting with the first claim: "When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no." For that claim, the ad cites as its source the roll call vote of Dec. 16, 2009, on HR 3326, the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 2010. We asked Kaptur's office how she supported her claim of obtaining "$42 million for new manufacturing jobs." Her staff listed 19 projects which she sponsored or co-sponsored that were included in the military spending bill, which passed on the roll call by a vote of 395 to 34, with five members not voting. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no. The 19 projects are all directed spending, or earmarks, for Ohio. We confirmed them on the LegiStorm database using information from the group Taxpayers for Common Sense. They were sponsored by Kaptur alone or with other members of the Ohio delegation, including Republicans and Democrats. Kucinich co-sponsored one of the appropriations, $2 million for research on renewable hydrocarbon fuels for military applications, at the Edison Materials Technology Center in Toledo. The earmarks totaled more than $59 million in our count. "We used a conservative estimate," Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought said. In response, Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz noted something else about the military spending act. "The principal provisions of that bill included $127.3 billion in additional defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan," he said. Though the measure also included "a host of other, non-defense-related expenditures," he said, Kucinich voted against it as a long-time opponent of the wars. "He has urged for years that those wars be ended and the troops brought home, and that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent there be re-directed to support crucial domestic needs, including re-building the nation's infrastructure, improving education, and meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and under-insured," Juniewicz said. "For Kaptur to misrepresent his anti-war vote as a vote against new manufacturing jobs in Northern Ohio is, plainly and deliberately, dishonest." Kaptur's campaign called it "a matter of how you characterize the votes." "Those projects were in that bill, and Kucinich voted against them, including one of the projects he had sponsored," Fought said. "He wants to characterize it as an anti-war vote and not an anti-jobs vote. "In Congress you don't get to cherry pick on legislation. He wants to have it both ways. It's a matter of whether you take responsibility for your final vote or not." We think characterization is an issue on both sides. Kaptur’s statement is partially accurate. Kucinich did vote against the legislation containing the earmarks. But there are important details missing from the claim. While the measures sponsored by Kaptur were, in fact, appropriations for work to be done on projects in Ohio, her campaign omits important information by characterizing earmarks in the defense budget simply as money "for new manufacturing jobs." Also, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation. Kaptur and Kucinich are longtime colleagues in the House. As such, Kaptur certainly is well aware of Kucinich’s steadfast opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His vote in this case is consistent with that position. Characterizing his vote as opposition to spending on programs that could create jobs is simply misleading. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kaptur’s claim rates Half True.	None	Marcy Kaptur	None	None	None	2012-02-24T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['Marcy_Kaptur', 'Dennis_Kucinich']
pomt-15241	Says Jeb Bush "significantly cut early voting prior to the 2008 presidential election."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/05/arthenia-joyner/arthenia-joyner-says-jeb-bush-cut-states-early-vot/	The Florida Legislature’s Democratic minority leader challenged former Gov. Jeb Bush’s commitment to voting outreach, accusing him of limiting access to polling places for black voters. Sen. Arthenia Joyner of Tampa sent out a letter addressed to Bush, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, ahead of his speech to the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale on July 31, 2015, excoriating him for shortening early voting hours as governor. She also said he purged voter rolls and refused to restore voting rights to convicted felons. "Also troubling was your decision to significantly cut early voting prior to the 2008 presidential election," Joyner wrote on July 30. She said legislation he signed was designed "to diminish turnout in minority communities that were increasingly relying on early voting." PolitiFact Florida has addressed the Bush-era voting purges in 2000 and 2004 before, as well as the recent history of restoring felon voting rights. But did Bush cut early voting hours? It turns out that while he signed a 2004 bill that allowed early voting, he also signed a bill the following year that set new limits on the practice. Voting changes After the 2000 presidential election’s numerous problems, Florida overhauled its system and began allowing early voting for the first time with a law Bush signed in 2004. That law provided for a statewide maximum of 14 early voting days and at least eight hours of voting per day. Early voting days could be any length counties chose; Pinellas allowed 10 hours per day in 2004, while Miami-Dade kept early voting polling places open for 12 hours per day. Many Floridians welcomed the changes, with some counties reporting more than 50 percent of voters cast ballots before Election Day. But there also were some reports of harassment at poorly monitored early voting sites, issues with poorly tested voting methods and a general lack of oversight for some locations, according to a 2005 Early Voting Information Center study. Still, some election supervisors asked lawmakers to expand early voting hours and add more locations. Bush and the GOP-led Legislature decided to do the opposite the following year. Joyner did not return our email or phone calls, but the 2005 law she mentioned, HB 1567, cut voting hours to a maximum of eight hours per day and limited polling places to election offices, city halls and libraries. Polling places could only be open between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Early voting also couldn’t be held more than eight hours total on any weekend, and it had to end the Sunday before the election. It did not change the 14-day maximum, but it did cut hours for counties that kept polls open longer than eight hours. In Miami-Dade, for example, early voting hours were cut by a third from prior 12-hour days, speaking to Joyner’s characterization that Bush "significantly cut" early voting. The changes took effect for the 2006 election cycle, the last before Bush left office in January 2007. Democrats accused Republicans of trying to limit access for minorities and workers who couldn’t leave their jobs to vote. GOP legislators said the changes were to bring some uniformity to polling options. Two years later, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama won Florida en route to a victory in the 2008 presidential election. There were reports of very long lines and finicky voting machines that year, but there also was an increase in registered voters. Between December 2007 and October 2008, more than 233,000 black Floridians registered to vote. About 54 percent of black voters cast early ballots in the 2008 election. Early voting continues to be popular statewide, especially with Democratic voters. About 53 percent of the 6 million people who participated in the 2014 election voted early in person or by absentee ballot. But debate over early voting remained after Bush left office. Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature in 2011 further reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Long lines subsequently plagued the 2012 presidential election. An Ohio State study estimated 201,000 Floridians didn’t vote because of the wait on Election Day. In 2013, Scott signed a bill restoring early voting to up to 12 hours a day for 14 days. Our ruling Joyner said Bush "significantly cut early voting prior to the 2008 presidential election." Bush signed a 2005 bill limiting early voting to a maximum of eight hours per day, specifying the changes would take effect in 2006. That did scale back early voting hours in some counties quite a bit. But there’s no mention that Bush also signed the 2004 bill that established early voting in Florida in the first place, part of a post-2000 election overhaul. We also have to add that the GOP-led Legislature drafted both bills. Joyner’s statement is accurate but could use additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05196	Portland, Ore., has "never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership" of its public transit system "in the past 12 years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/12/steve-brown/transportation-tax-foe-says-transit-friendly-city/	Georgia temperatures are beginning to heat up. And so is the rhetoric over the proposed 1 percent sales tax hike to fund metro Atlanta transportation projects. Transportation tax opponent Steve Brown recently told metro voters that Portland, Ore., is a cautionary tale for fans of public transit. Yes, Portland. That town whose residents are so in love with its buses and rail that others mock them for it. An attendee at a forum hosted by the Republican Women of Cherokee County called MARTA a business failure and asked panelists why the 10-year tax would fund a slate of projects that include public transit. That’s when Brown, a Fayette County commissioner, brought up Portland. He called it "the most transit-friendly city in the United States of America." "And they’ve never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership in the past 12 years," Brown said. Portland? The metro Atlanta tax, which is up for a vote July 31, would raise about $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, or as much as $8.5 billion after inflation. It would fund 157 projects in metro Atlanta, including roads, bridges and rail. No rail is slated for Cherokee County. Brown opposes the tax for a number of reasons. One is that he thinks it would fund too much mass transit. First, a word on "ridership." Transportation policy wonks use this term to refer to a very specific thing, and it’s not what Brown described. "Ridership" is the number of times a passenger boards public transportation. In metro Portland, that number is rising. Fourth quarter 2002 data show there were about 288,000 boardings on Portland’s TriMet public transit system on an average weekday, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Ten years later, it was 323,000. That’s an increase of about 12 percent. (This does not necessarily mean more people are riding TriMet. Ridership can increase if passengers make more transfers.) We realize, though, that average folks might not care about the technical definition of "ridership." Brown spoke in percentage terms, so we think it’s fair to say that the audience got the impression that he was talking about the percentage of Portland-area residents who ride transit. Brown backed up his point by sending PolitiFact Georgia data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s yearly American Community Survey. They describe what forms of transportation commuters use to get to their jobs. They showed that from 1997 through 2008, between 12 percent and 15 percent of Portlanders mainly used public transportation to get to work. The most recent ACS data showed this percentage remained near 12 percent from 2006 through 2010. Brown sent us other surveys by the city of Portland that show similar results. The share of commuters shrinks to about 6 percent when you include metro workers who live outside the city’s boundaries, according to ACS data. This number has also held steady in recent years. But commutes are only one part of the story. Riders also use it to go to school or events, to run errands, or to take trips to the airport. We talked to Jarrett Walker, a public transit expert whom Brown suggested we contact. Walker’s website is where Brown got his ACS numbers. We also talked to Alan Pisarski, an expert on road congestion and how people use different forms of transportation. Pisarski said the "lion’s share" of trips on public transit are for work, and the percentage of commuters who use it during the height of rush hour can have the greatest impact on traffic congestion. But, Pisarski said, the ACS measures commuter behavior only. Walker thinks it’s a bad idea to predict the effects of an expanded MARTA system based on Portland’s experience. The success of a planned system depends more on how the land around potential stations develops. "It doesn't matter much how many people use it occasionally or the balance between regular and occasional riders," Walker told PolitiFact Georgia. Nationally, commuting trips make up about 60 percent of transit rides, according to data from a five-year study by the American Public Transportation Association that was released in 2007. A 2010 survey by TriMet found that 80 percent of adults in the system’s service area ride it. Some 43 percent use the system occasionally, regularly or frequently. Of TriMet’s frequent and regular riders, 44 percent use it primarily to travel to work while 26 percent use it primarily for school. These percentages have held steady for the past 10 years, TriMet data showed. The survey’s sample size of 1,000 adults is small and the research was conducted by an agency with a big stake in the results, but we think TriMet’s findings are reasonable. We compared its results with the ACS and found they square with each other. Our ruling: If Brown said that the percentage of Portland adults who use public transit to get to work has stayed between 12 percent and 15 percent, his claim would have been accurate. But that’s not what he said. Brown said Portland has "never gotten over 12 to 15 percent ridership" of its public transit system "in the past 12 years." This gives the impression that only a tiny percentage of adults in TriMet’s service area use the system. But a credible source of data shows that about 40 percent use it a couple of times a month or more. Include infrequent riders and that number climbs to 80 percent. Furthermore, "ridership," as transit experts understand it, is up. Brown’s statement would be correct if he were just talking about Portland commuters. But the actual "ridership" (Brown’s word) increases substantially when you include the people who use rail a few times a month. Throw in infrequent riders and the number skyrockets. Brown’s statement is misleading and needs a lot of context to move any higher on the Truth-O-Meter. He earns a Half True.

pomt-01158	The U.S. has "5 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of the world’s known prison population."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/15/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-5-percent-worlds-population-25-pe/	The United States has too many people in behind bars, says former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s considering running for president. "We have 5 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of the world’s known prison population," Webb, a Democrat, said during a Dec. 3 conference with Virginia journalists that was coordinated by the Associated Press. The statement isn’t new to Webb. He cited the same figures during his term in the Senate from 2007-2013 when he introduced unsuccessful legislation to create a National Criminal Justice Commission charged with making recommendations for overhauling the U.S. justice system. We emailed Webb three times asking for the sources of his numbers, but didn’t hear back. So we set out on our own to see whether his statistics on the United States’ outsized prison populations hold up. The same statistical claim has been made by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. The first part of the statement -- the U.S. share of the world’s population -- is pretty much correct. The U.S. has a population of 319.4 million while the global population is about 7.2 billion, according to the Census Bureau. That works out to a 4.4 percent share of the world’s population. The second part -- the United States’ share of the world’s prison population -- comes from the Centre on Prison Studies at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom, which publishes widely cited studies on the global prison population. In its latest report, from October 2013, the center said there were 10.2 million people in penal institutions around the world. The U.S., the center said, had 2.24 million prisoners -- a figure that includes 1.5 million people in state and federal prisons and about 740,000 in local jails. That means the U.S. held nearly 22 percent of the world’s prison population. The center puts a few qualifiers on its figures, which are mostly provided by each country’s national agency overseeing prisons. Not all of the national numbers are complete, particularly for China. The Chinese government says the nation has 1.64 million prisoners, but an estimated 650,000 more may be serving in pre-trial or "administrative detention," according to the center. Hard figures on the penal populations aren’t released by some nations, including North Korea. There are an estimated 150,000 people living in pre-trial or administrative detention in that country, the center said. If estimates of North Korean prisoners and Chinese tallies for pre-trial detainees are included, then the world penal population is closer to 11 million, the center said. That would mean the U.S. prison population would be 20 percent of the world’s prison population. We note, however, that Webb’s qualified statement said the U.S. had one quarter of the world’s "known prison population." It also should be pointed out that the year from which the study tallies prison populations differs from country to country. For example, the U.S. prison population comes from the December 2011 while other countries’ populations were tallied at different times from September 2011 to September 2013. Despite the issues, the center’s list is the most comprehensive tally of the global prison population. Its research has been cited by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of three dozen industrialized nations -- and by the National Academies of Sciences. Michael Rushford is president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which backs tough criminal sentences. He said the problem with the center’s research is some country’s prison tallies can’t be verified independently and those nations are likely low-balling the size of their penal populations. "Are we taking communist China’s word on how many people they have in prison? They have no reason to tell us the truth," Rushford said. "It’s easy to verify who is in prison in Great Britain or Switzerland … You try that in North Korea or China or Iran." Why does the U.S. have a such a high level of incarceration? One large reason -- according to Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a group seeking to reform justice policies -- is that the U.S. has higher violent crime rates than most industrialized nations, leading to longer prison sentences. Another reason is that the U.S. tends to dole out longer sentences than other nations, he said. An April 2014 report from the National Academies of Sciences said the U.S. prison and jail population in 2012 was 2.23 million -- seven times the number in 1972. The study attributed the growth to several factors, including tough-on-crime policies that created mandatory minimum sentences and increased penalties for drug-related offenses. Although on an upward trend for decades, the level of the U.S. inmates has declined in recent years. A 2013 report by the International Centre for Prison Studies showed the U.S. had the world’s highest incarceration rate at 716 inmates per 100,000 people. Updated figures on the center’s website show the U.S. now has 707 prisoners per 100,000 population, ranking it second behind the island nation of the Seychelles (population 90,595), which has a prison population rate of 868 per 100,000 people. Our ruling Webb says the U.S. has 5 percent of the world’s population but 25 percent of the world’s "known prison population." His numbers are a bit off. The U.S. has 4.4 percent of the world’s population and 22 percent of its prisoners. But we won’t quibble. Webb’s central point holds up: That, when measured in global percentages, the United States’ prison population is five times greater than its general population. We rate Webb’s statement True.

pomt-13589	"Today California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-california-besting-texas-creati/	Ever-proud Texas has lately been bested in job gains and economic oomph by California, a Texas Democrat pokes. Julián Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, brought up California during the Texas Democratic Party’s state convention after noting that as governor, Republican Rick Perry taunted the west coast state for its economy not matching his home state’s pace. "Today," the former San Antonio mayor told reporters June 17, 2016, "California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas. Maybe what we need to do is trade in Gov. Jerry Brown," of California, "for Gov. Greg Abbott and get better results." Castro made a similar declaration in his evening keynote speech, telling delegates: "This is what happens when a party doesn’t believe in government in the first place but has absolute power over its people for decades. You know, they used to brag that Texas was doing so much better than big bad liberal California. But Texas Republicans managed to bungle that too. Because today California is kicking our butt in job development and economic growth." Castro’s backup Wondering how Castro reached his conclusion, we heard back from Manny Garcia, a state party official, who said by email that Castro drew on news stories and government data to find Texas trailing. Garcia also provided what he described as Castro’s personally prepared backup document. Over the 12 months starting in June 2015, Castro’s footnoted document notes, Texas added an estimated 171,800 seasonally adjusted jobs, per the Texas Workforce Commission. California from April 2015 through April 2016 reportedly added 450,200 jobs, the document says. Castro’s document also declares that California has lately seen greater percentage increases in Gross Domestic Product. Between the first quarter of 2014 and the last quarter of 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced June 14, 2016, California saw a 4.1 percent increase in GDP, based on national prices for the goods and services produced within each state. Texas’ GDP had gone up 3.8 percent, per the bureau. Also noted by Castro, California’s real GDP grew 2.7 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2015; Texas’s GDP "only grew" 1.4 percent. Castro’s document further notes that from 2014 to 2015, per capita personal income in California grew by 5.3 percent, according to a March 2016 Bureau of Economic Analysis document. In the same year, per capita personal income in Texas grew 2.4 percent, according to the bureau fact sheet about Texas. Economists comment For our part, we noticed that Castro compared raw changes in jobs over slightly different time periods. Economists we queried agreed the population difference between the states makes raw counts less useful than rate-of-change comparisons. At the time Castro spoke, the latest available U.S. Census Bureau population estimates indicated that as of July 2015, the Golden State was home to 38.8 million people and Texas had 27 million residents--or 30 percent fewer. To compare job gains for each state over a similar period, we turned to Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist in the Dallas office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By email, Abbot advised that from May 2015 through April 2016, 32 states had statistically significant year-over-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment. The largest job gains, she said, were in California, Florida and Texas, with 440,300, 253,900 and 171,800 jobs gained, respectively. In percentage growth, Abbot said, the annual rate of jobs growth for California was 2.8 percent, compared with Texas’ 1.5 percent. So, booyah for California? We asked Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the Royal Holloway University of London formerly employed by the University of Texas, to assess the jobs figures with Castro’s claim in mind. By email, Hamermesh replied that Castro was right for the short term though Texas continues to look better in the long view; from May 2006 to May 2016, the state saw job gains of 18.6 percent as California experienced 8 percent growth, Hamermesh said. After we downloaded the government’s monthly counts of jobs in each state, we found that as of May 2016, California had experienced greater percentage gains in employment than Texas for every 12-month period going back to 2011. It’s only if you go back further that Texas’s jobs growth exceeds the growth for California. This doesn’t entirely mean Texas loses out. Separately to our inquiry, Tara Sinclair, chief economist for Indeed, a job-posting service, pointed out by email that Texas has long enjoyed a lower unemployment rate--a facet Castro didn’t mention. Sinclair drew on data posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to show that Texas’ unemployment rate has trailed California’s rate since before 2010. Sinclair also prepared a graph showing that since about 1990, Texas has had a better nonfarm employment-to-population ratio than California, though both states have shown improvement since 2010: All in all, Sinclair said by email, "focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading due to the different population sizes of the two states. By both the unemployment rate (a standard measure of labor market health) as well as the employment to population ratio, Texas's labor market actually looks healthier than California's." GDP and personal income Castro’s other suggested indicators--GDP and personal income growth--check out in California’s favor. We confirmed his provided GDP figures, also spotting two sets of inflation-adjusted Bureau of Economic Analysis figures of note: --California’s $2.2 trillion GDP in the first quarter of 2016 was up 4.7 percent from its $2.17 trillion GDP in the first quarter of 2015 while Texas’ first quarter 2016 GDP of $1.48 trillion was up 0.2 percent from $1.478 trillion 12 months before (figures in chained 2009 dollars). --California’s 2015 per capita real GDP of $56,395 was up 3.2 percent from $54,606 in 2014; Texas’s per capita GDP of $53,707 was up 1.8 percent from $52,742 in 2014. Meantime, the bureau’s state-by-state breakout shows California with the bigger improvement in personal income between the last quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2016. Personal income means net earnings from property income and other sources including government programs. California saw 0.9 percent growth in per capita personal income between the last quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, according to another bureau chart, while Texas saw 0.8 percent growth. California also saw greater growth by this metric each of the previous four quarters, per the chart, with Texas last having a growth edge in the fourth quarter of 2014: Our ruling Castro said that "today," California is "creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas." These fightin’ words hold up based on recent jobs growth and relative changes in GDP and personal income. Still (just a tad whiney here) would it hurt to acknowledge that Texas continues to enjoy a lower unemployment rate? We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-10748	"In the 1990s, the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets. As a result, murder and violent crime rates went down eight years in a row."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/02/joe-biden/call-the-exaggeration-police/	Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., was indeed a leading advocate for Community Oriented Police Services, or COPS, a key part of the 1994 crime bill. But once we get past that, what the program actually accomplished isn't nearly as clear-cut as Biden maintains. Let's consider his claim in two parts. Part 1: The COPS program was designed to use three-year federal grants to put an additional 100,000 officers on the street from 1994 through 2000. The Justice Department claims it reached that milestone in May 1999, but the department's Office of Inspector General found that the actual number was closer to 60,000. "Moreover, because some of the early grants are going to be expiring, and therefore the obligation to retain the officers will expire, there is some concern that we will never have 100,000 officers on the street at the same time," Robert L. Ashbaugh, the acting inspector general, told the House Subcommittee on Crime in October 1999. The discrepancy in numbers was due to certain assumptions the Justice Department made about how local agencies spent their COPS grants, the report and another study found. This was especially true for certain grants designed to redeploy officers from desk jobs to the street by paying for new technology, the inspector general found. "Just because you get the money, that doesn't mean you're using it" for officers, said David Muhlhausen, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has studied the COPS program. The Justice Department stands by its figure of putting 100,000 officers on the street, a spokesman said. It appealed the inspector general's report to a special master, who found the report did suffer from misinterpreting some Justice Department data. The discrepancy has never really been solved. A 2005 report on COPS by the Government Accountability Office did not directly address it, but said that, "For all years from 1994 through 2001, we estimate that COPS expenditures paid for a total of about 88,000 additional officer-years." Part 2: Biden's claim that crime rates dropped "as a result" of those extra officers is, in the words of several criminologists, "absurd," "simplistic" and "ridiculous." This is what sealed our ruling of False. While it may seem intuitive that putting more cops on the beat would deter crime, several government and independent studies have failed to prove a strong link between COPS and the 32 percent drop in violent crime rates from 1993 to 2001. An October 2005 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that COPS helped cut crime modestly, about 1.1 percent in 1997 and as much as 1.3 percent in 2000, at a cost of some $8-billion. "While we find that COPS expenditures led to increases in sworn police officers above levels that would have been expected without these expenditures, and though the increases in sworn officers led to declines in crime, we conclude that COPS grants were not the major cause of the decline in crime from 1994 through 2001," the GAO report said. "Other factors ... combined to contribute more to the reduction in crime than did COPS expenditures. "This is not surprising, as COPS expenditures ... made a comparatively small contribution to local law enforcement expenditures for policing." More recently, a peer-reviewed study published in the February 2007 issue of the journal Criminology found that "COPS spending had little to no effect on crime." The exception was a 2002 study by researchers at the University of Nebraska and Southwest Texas State University, which found COPS had a major effect on cutting crime from 1994 through 2000, particularly in big cities. But the study was funded by the COPS program, raising questions of impartiality, and it failed to account for changing demographics after 1994. It also ignored the fact that crime was already dropping nationwide before COPS existed, critics said. In reality, studies show that no one thing — not even Biden's army of officers — can take credit for the declining crime rate in the 1990s and first five years of this century. Rather, it was likely the result of a complex series of factors, including population shifts, an improving economy, longer prison sentences for violent criminals, better policing and changes in drug use.

pomt-15387	A Texas law "will repatriate $1 billion of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve in New York to Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jun/26/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-1-billion-gold-bullion-headed-tex/	Uncle Sam’s loss will be Texas’s golden gain, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared after signing a proposal into law creating the Texas Bullion Depository. "The law," Abbott’s office said in a June 2015 press release, "will repatriate $1 billion of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve in New York to Texas." Repatriate, per Merriam-Webster, means to send money back to your country. "The bullion depository will serve as the custodian, guardian and administrator of bullion that may be transferred to or otherwise acquired by the State of Texas," the governor’s office said. A reader asked us to check Abbott’s description of the about-to-travel bullion, which generally can refer to bars made of gold or another precious metal. In his announcement, Abbott said he signed House Bill 483 into law "to provide a secure facility for the State of Texas, state agencies and Texas citizens to store gold bullion and other precious metals. With the passage of this bill, the Texas Bullion Depository will become the first state-level facility of its kind in the nation, increasing the security and stability of our gold reserves and keeping taxpayer funds from leaving Texas to pay for fees to store gold in facilities outside our state." We emailed Abbott aides per his Federal Reserve claim and didn’t hear back. Similarly, the author of the legislation, state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, did not engage. News stories on $1 billion in bullion But we spotted news stories characterizing the possible boon to Texas once the depository is set up. Early in 2015, Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman wrote that not long ago, a University of Texas unit had a billion dollars in bullion stowed in New York, though Herman made no mention of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The reserve bank in New York has a vault in Manhattan, it says online, where it secures bullion for the U.S. government, foreign governments, other central banks and official international organizations--though evidently not U.S. state agencies. Herman wrote: "The bullion storage business is centered in New York City and Delaware. And that gets us to the second part of the profit deal here. Texas now pays to store its gold in NYC. When Capriglione checked in 2013, the University of Texas Investment Management Company paid to store its 6,643 gold bars--worth around $1 billion--in what he calls the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank in New York. "Says UTIMCO CEO Bruce Zimmerman: The gold holdings now are down to about $725 million. He was not immediately sure how many gold bars that is. They're stored in Manhattan at HSBC Bank, which charges an annual fee of less than one-tenth of 1 percent per year. "HSBC is a British multinational bank that started as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp." Later, a May 2015 Houston Chronicle news story on Capriglione’s proposal quoted the Senate sponsor, Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, specifying UTIMCO in March 2015 had 5,610 gold bars in its portfolio, an investment worth $645 million, and was being charged a storage fee of $108 per bar by a bullion depository in New York, a total storage cost of more than $605,000 a year. "New York will hate this," Kolkhorst said of the proposal. "To me, that and the fact that it will save Texas money makes it a golden idea." A May 30, 2015, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story noted the intended change in law would allow, rather than require, bullion deposits. That story and news accounts published the same week by the Associated Press and the Dallas Morning News each aired the billion-dollar figure. In fact, the AP and Star-Telegram accounts said the state had more than $1 billion in gold stored elsewhere. Fiscal analysis of legislation We didn’t confirm a billion-plus figure. And a state financial projection did not mention the potential value of any bullion likely to shift to Texas--from any location. The May 30, 2015, fiscal note by the staff of the advisory Legislative Budget Board said: "Depending upon the number of depository transactions and the amount of fees that could be assessed to depository agents, there could be an indeterminate fiscal impact to the state." The analysis concluded that at this time, how much money the state makes from "depository activities" could not be estimated. Generally, the fiscal note said, the Texas Bullion Depository, directed by an appointee of the state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, "would hold certain bullion and specie acquired by the state or a political subdivision of the state; could receive and hold such deposits for private entities; and would use depository agents, as described in the bill, to conduct retail transactions on behalf of the depository with current and prospective depository account holders," the fiscal note said, with deposits and related assets not available for legislators to spend. UT: $650 million in bullion in a New York bank About that billion: To our inquiry, a UT System spokeswoman, Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, emailed us a statement from UTIMCO’s Zimmerman: "At one time over the past few years, UTIMCO did in fact have an investment of approximately $1 billion in gold bullion. As of today, the investment is closer to $650 million in gold bullion. "UTIMCO also has investments in gold financial futures," Zimmerman said. "We do not know what any other Texas-related investment fund may or may not own. Also, UTIMCO may buy or sell gold bullion or gold futures at any time so future ownership cannot be predicted." Currently, he said, the gold is held in storage in a vault located in New York "and is part of a bank, and therefore under the auspices of the Federal Reserve System, but it is not owned or controlled directly by the Federal Reserve." Zimmerman said UTIMCO will "seriously consider" moving its bullion to the Texas depository if it’s created and is a "robust member of the COMEX (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) which facilitates and eases buying and selling of gold bullion by having it fully integrated with the gold financial futures marketplace" and if, he said, UTIMCO’s "costs are equal to or less than what is now being paid." LaCoste-Caputo, by email, said the precise value of the gold bars, as of June 24, 2015, was $661,424,610. Potentially of note, she said, the UT System Board of Regents would need to approve moving the gold. She said the likely scenario is that UTIMCO would make a recommendation for the board to consider. Next, we checked with other agencies including retirement systems and the comptroller's office and did not identify additional state-owned bullion that might could be shifted to the Texas depository. Our ruling Abbott said the new law "will repatriate $1 billion of gold bullion from the Federal Reserve in New York to Texas." We see a thread of truth here in the law creating a Texas depository that could field bullion deposits. But the statute doesn’t repatriate any bullion. In addition, UTIMCO has around $660 million in gold bullion (not $1 billion) and it's stored in a New York bank, not the Federal Reserve. We rate Abbott’s statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-04509	"(Barack Obama) says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he's going to do it."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-barack-obama-has-not-outline/	For the news media citing a lack of detail in Mitt Romney’s proposals, Gov. Chris Christie offers these instructions: be fair to the Republican presidential nominee and get tough on President Barack Obama for not providing the specifics behind his own promises. During an interview Sunday on NBC’s "Meet the Press," host David Gregory noted how Romney has failed to enumerate which tax deductions he would eliminate, and asked Christie whether Romney would provide those details during Wednesday’s debate. The New Jersey governor argued that the media should be "just as tough on the president" for failing to explain how he would reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion. "He says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he’s going to do it," Christie, a Republican, told Gregory. "I mean, you know, let’s be fair here." The governor repeated that claim later in the interview, saying Obama "puts out a nice two-minute ad that says he’s going to reduce the debt by four trillion, but never tells us how." OK, governor, let’s be fair: you’re wrong to claim Obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan. In an 80-page report issued in September 2011 and again in the president’s budget proposal released in February, the Obama administration has laid out detailed proposals and dollar amounts for how to achieve more than $4 trillion in savings over the next decade. The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment. Let’s explain some of those details. Obama’s deficit reduction plan relies on a mix of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts. A large part of the savings would come from roughly $1.5 trillion worth of tax reform measures. For instance, the plan would allow federal income tax cuts to expire for upper-income taxpayers, while extending them for other Americans. The president’s plan also would reduce certain tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers and close various tax loopholes, such as by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies. In many cases, the reform proposals are so specific that only tax policy wonks may really understand them. Another roughly $850 billion in savings would come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the president’s budget. In addition, the deficit reduction plan accounts for roughly $1 trillion in spending cuts built into legislation signed by the president last year. The Obama administration also has provided specific proposals for more than $500 billion in spending cuts and reforms to mandatory programs. Those provisions include changes to Medicare and Medicaid; a reduction in certain agricultural subsidies; and a series of reforms within the U.S. Postal Service, such as reducing mail delivery from six days to five days per week. However, the president’s plan has received both praise and criticism. "Such a balanced approach -- both increases in revenues and reductions in spending -- is the only approach that will put the budget on an economically and politically sustainable path," wrote James R. Horney, vice president of Federal Fiscal Policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. But Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, said in a news release that "the use of this war gimmick is quite troubling. "Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings," she said. Our ruling In an interview on NBC’s "Meet the Press," Christie claimed Obama "says he’s gonna reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he's gonna do it." But the president has outlined in extensive detail how he would achieve more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. That plan has received mixed reviews, but it’s ridiculous for Christie to suggest Obama has not provided such specific proposals. So, governor, here’s a fiery dose of fairness for you: Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d67054db-a2e9-4a49-b5a7-edc9ea760199 To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10063	"Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/26/barack-obama/obama-numbers-income-explanation/	President Obama argued forcefully for an economic stimulus bill in his weekly radio and YouTube address on Jan. 24, 2009. "We begin this year and this administration in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that calls for unprecedented action," Obama said. "Just this week, we saw more people file for unemployment than at any time in the last 26 years, and experts agree that if nothing is done, the unemployment rate could reach double digits. Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four." We've heard lots of big numbers about the recession, but we were especially interested in whether a family of four would lose $12,000 in income. Let's start with the $1 trillion number. For numbers on the economy, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal agency charged with providing objective, nonpartisan analysis to Congress. Its most recent report, issued on Jan. 8, 2009, found that economic output could fall 6.8 percent below its potential. For the roughly $14.2 trillion economy projected for 2009, an unrealized potential of 6.8 percent does come out to about $1 trillion. Now how does that translate for a family of four? As near as we can tell, Obama took the $1 trillion and divided by 300 million — the number of people who live in the United States. That comes to $3,333 per person. Multiply it by four and you get $13,333, or a conservative $12,000. Now, we can't say for sure that's how Obama arrived at his number for wages. We asked the press office about it and didn't hear back. (In their defense, they have reportedly been having e-mail trouble .) It's certainly possible Obama used a more sophisticated analysis to determine unrealized wages. But the economists we talked to said no matter how Obama determined the number for a family of four, any average oversimplifies how economic downturns affect the public. Some family members, for example, will see no drop in their wages, or might even get new jobs that increase their income. For other families, it will be much, much worse. "It makes it sound like everybody's income goes down by $12,000," said Bob Williams, of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "That's just not true. It never gets spread out like that." "If Bill Gates walks into a bar, then you can say, on average, everyone in that bar is a millionaire," Williams said. "That doesn't mean there's more than one millionaire in the bar." Another economist, Russell Roberts of George Mason University, agreed, saying the hardest hit will be the unemployed. "The average loss of $12,000 is a weird number," Roberts said. "Some families will face tough times. Others much less so." Roberts, a market-oriented economist who has questioned the effectiveness of the stimulus plan, also pointed out that the $1 trillion number is nothing more than a projection. "Yes, the economy could underperform by a trillion dollars. Or two. Or three. No one knows," he said. We recognize his point, but we looked at this statement more to see if Obama was exaggerating his numbers to make a case for the stimulus. Yes, the numbers are in line with a widely accepted nonpartisan source. But in trying to personalize the numbers for families, he takes things a step too far and oversimplifies. Many viewers and listeners might think most families will lose about $12,000 in income. Realistically, they will probably do much better or much worse than that. For that reason, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-01-26T17:27:27	2009-01-24	['None']
pomt-09669	If you look at last year's presidential campaign, "you can't find a mention of public option."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/joe-lieberman/public-option-was-not-discussed-much-during-campai/	Democrats hoping to pass health care legislation through the Senate need 60 votes to begin consideration of the bill and, ultimately, to pass it. That means every Democrat and the two independents who generally vote with them need to approve. One of those independents is Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Lieberman favors health care reform but opposes the public option. He told Politico that he was keeping "all my options open" when it comes to votes on health care. He said the public option has only recently become a key part of Democratic plans for a health care overhaul. "It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option," Lieberman said. "It was added after the election as a part of what we normally consider health insurance reform — insurance market reforms, cover people, cover people who are not covered." Politico pointed out, correctly, that Lieberman was wrong about the public option being added after the election. It was part of Obama's plans released publicly during the campaign. But we wanted to check his statement that during the 2008 presidential election, "you can't find a mention of public option." Here at PolitiFact, we covered the Democratic primaries and examined the candidates' plans for health care reform in great detail. The most contentious issue during the primary was support for what is known as the individual mandate -- the requirement that everyone have health insurance or face a tax penalty. We don't recall any significant discussion of a public option, nor did we do any Truth-O-Meter items on it during the campaign. To make sure we weren't missing anything, we conducted a database search of campaign coverage by all news outlets. We found very few news reports during the campaign that mentioned the public option or a public plan as part of Obama's health proposals, with the notable exception of a New York Times story published on May 30, 2007, headlined, " Obama calls for wider and less costly health care coverage. " Here's what the Times reported: "Mr. Obama would create a public plan for individuals who cannot obtain group coverage through their employers or the existing government programs, like Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Children would be required to have health insurance. Subsidies would be available for those who need help with the cost of coverage. "He would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange, a regulated marketplace of competing private health plans intended to give individuals other, more affordable options for coverage. The public plan would compete in that Insurance Exchange, advisers said." The Obama campaign mentioned the public option briefly in its health position paper and on its Web site. A typical description went like this: "The Obama-Biden plan will create a National Health Insurance Exchange to help individuals purchase new affordable health care options if they are uninsured or want new health insurance. Through the Exchange, any American will have the opportunity to enroll in the new public plan or an approved private plan, and income-based sliding scale tax credits will be provided for people and families who need it. ... The Exchange will require that all the plans offered are at least as generous as the new public plan and meet the same standards for quality and efficiency." But there was little discussion about the public option. The debate in both the primary and the general election focused on the mandate, costs and covering the uninsured. We found the public option mentioned in only 70 articles or transcripts during the entire campaign and months prior to the inauguration. It wasn't until after Obama took office that there was sustained attention to the issue. There were 50 items published between January and May and then coverage exploded this past summer. Major newspapers produced about 650 significant stories or op-eds on Obama and the public option in June, July and August. Lieberman was wrong that the public option was added after the election, but he makes a valid point that it wasn't emphasized or discussed much during the campaign. Lieberman said, "It's classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year, presidential, you can't find a mention of public option." We found a few mentions, but the public option was not at all a significant point of debate during the presidential campaign. So we rate Lieberman's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14398	"Roy Cooper won't say how he will pay for ‘free’ college tuition."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/14/pat-mccrory/mccrory-right-cooper-lacks-plan-paying-overstates-/	A week before North Carolina’s Democratic primary for governor, N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper unveiled his eight-point plan for public education, including proposals for Pre-K programs, child care tax credits, literacy programs, teacher pay and college affordability. It was that last part that caught the eye of Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration. The next day, McCrory released a statement bashing Cooper and trying to tie him to former Gov. Bev Perdue. McCrory lost to Perdue in 2008 but won the governor’s office in 2012 after Perdue, facing low popularity numbers, decided not to seek re-election. "Just like Bev Perdue, Roy Cooper won't say how he will pay for ‘free’ college tuition," McCrory said in a Facebook post. That claim and ones like it have since been repeated often by the McCrory campaign. Perdue did indeed propose free tuition plans, and in their 2008 campaign McCrory criticized her for them. She shelved them just days before she was sworn in, citing the worsening recession. But we were more curious about what McCrory had to say about his current opponent. Does Cooper really propose offering free college tuition? And does he lack a plan to pay for it? Luckily, finding the answers didn't require us to go back to college for another costly degree. First, the promise of tuition The McCrory administration paints an overly broad stroke here by simply using the term "college." Cooper’s plan only covers community college. Cooper promises in his plan – which is available on his website – "to design a proposal for North Carolina to offer free tuition for community college." His plan doesn't mention anything about making four-year colleges or advanced degree programs free. Furthermore, free community college tuition is already partially in place, at least for enterprising teenagers. Anyone who’s enrolled in a public, private or home-school high school and has a B average can take community college classes for free – a program called Career and College Promise that Perdue started in 2011, with support from the Republican-led legislature. Cooper is proposing to expand the availability of free tuition to everyone, though. That’s a lot of people, but not nearly as many as if he were proposing free tuition for college in general, as McCrory implied. A plan to pay for it? The state has reported that 733,855 students took classes at the state’s 58 community college campuses in the 2014-15 school year. The North Carolina community college system calls itself the third largest in the country. It would cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year if the state paid all those students’ tuition, which is $76 per credit hour this year. But Cooper's plan says the state shouldn’t pay for 100 percent of the tuition. He proposes covering what’s left after factoring in scholarships and financial aid. Still, that’s not nothing. So what's Cooper’s plan to pay for it? McCrory said Cooper "won't say." And that much is true. Cooper’s plan is specific on what he wants to pay for, but not on where the money would come from. It also doesn’t provide an estimate as to how much the plan might cost. Cooper spoke to reporters after releasing his plan on March 8. According to The Associated Press, he gave a few vague ideas for paying the plan, but he mostly stressed that he wouldn't increase taxes to pay for it. Instead, he said he wanted to rework some of the recent tax changes passed by the General Assembly, but "I'm not wedded to any particular formula." Citing the presumably high cost of the program, McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz said Cooper "seemingly is trying to be coy about reviving a broken promise from former governor Bev Perdue." But just because Cooper hasn't detailed how he would pay for community college tuition doesn't mean he has no plan whatsoever. He outlines how he will put together a team to figure out the details, and what kind of benefits he thinks such a program would have. Let’s hear it, in its entirety: "A number of states either have a free community college program or are considering offering one. The program works as a last dollar scholarship program whereby the state provides a grant to cover the remaining share of tuition and fees after Pell Grants and other financial aid and scholarships are applied. Most programs also offer mentors to help students navigate the college process on their journey toward success. As governor, I will put together a team of education partners and budgetary advisors to design a proposal for North Carolina to offer free tuition for community college. This would provide more students access to college and create opportunity for students to earn better paying jobs. Additionally it will help our state to meet our employers’ demands for educated workers and address the gap that now exists for skilled labor." That's a start, although McCrory is right that Cooper hasn't given the public any details on how the state would pay for his plan. Our ruling McCrory's claim is overly broad, failing to distinguish between college and community college. In enrollment numbers and especially the cost of tuition, that's a massive difference. Adding the single word "community" might have toned down the intended rhetorical effect of the quote, but it also would've added needed context. Still, Cooper does propose offering free tuition for community college, which would cover hundreds of thousands of students statewide. He has said what the state won't pay for (the full cost of tuition) and one way he won’t pay for it (tax hikes), but it’s correct to say that Cooper does not have a specific plan – or at least one that’s publicly available – for paying for his proposal.

pomt-06612	Says "New Jersey’s $1 billion horse racing industry … employs 13,000 individuals and ensures the preservation of 176,000 acres of horse farmland."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/22/raymond-lesniak/state-sen-raymond-lesniak-says-new-jerseys-horse-r/	The glory days of horse racing in New Jersey have faded. But if the industry disappears completely, state Sen. Raymond Lesniak claims it will put 13,000 jobs and 176,000 acres of horse farmland at risk. Lesniak harnessed those statistics in an opinion item promoting two initiatives he says will generate new revenue for horse racing: sports betting and Internet gambling. Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill in March that would have allowed Internet gambling and declined to join a lawsuit aimed at overturning the ban on sports betting in the state. "There is a path to recovery for New Jersey’s $1 billion horse racing industry — which employs 13,000 individuals and ensures the preservation of 176,000 acres of horse farmland — if Gov. Chris Christie would just get off his high horse and see the irreparable damage his tough love is reaping on the industry," Lesniak (D-Union) wrote in a Sept. 9 letter to the editor in the Asbury Park Press. "Unfortunately, horse racing is not at a crossroad; it’s at a tipping point, from which it will not recover when it falls." PolitiFact New Jersey found Lesniak incorrectly applied statistics representing the overall equine industry to illustrate the impact of horse racing. The statistics are from a 2007 study by the Rutgers Equine Science Center that measured the economic impact of the state’s equine industry. All equine animals, including horses, donkeys and mules, were included in the study. But horses account for the bulk of New Jersey’s equine population. The report found that the equine industry has an annual economic impact of $1.1 billion and generates 13,000 jobs. Equine operations -- farms and stables that house equine animals -- in the state span 176,000 acres of farmland, according to the study. Of the $1.1 billion in economic impact, $780 million is generated by racetracks and racing-related operations. "So there’s no doubt that horse racing is the economic driving engine of the entire horse industry in New Jersey," said Karyn Malinowski, director of the Rutgers Equine Science Center. The horse racing industry is responsible for 7,000 of the 13,000 jobs in the overall equine industry and 34,000 of the 176,000 acres of farmland that comprise equine operations in the state, the study said. When we told Lesniak’s office about the problem with his statistics, he said, in a written statement, "My comment was for the entire horse industry because without horse racing it will ultimately die, as we’ve seen with the announced closing of the largest horse farm, Perretti." Perretti Farms of Cream Ridge specializes in the breeding and racing of standardbred horses, according to its website. This summer the farm announced plans to close in the next two years. So, Lesniak’s numbers are off, but let’s look at his larger point. Is the horse racing industry the lifeline of New Jersey’s equine industry? Malinowski said the entire equine industry is in danger if the horse racing industry crumbles. "All of these top-shelf support services that you have available to you in the Garden State will be gone," she said. "Because they are primarily supported by racing." Jim Heird, executive professor and coordinator at Texas A&M University’s Equine Initiative, said, in general, "If we lose one part of the industry, it affects the welfare of the entire industry." "I think that when any industry leaves the state, it will have some sort of an impact on the economy of the state," Lynne Richmond, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Agriculture said. "We recognize a loss of horse racing in New Jersey would have an impact." Our ruling Horse racing generates $780 million in annual economic impact in New Jersey. It's responsible for 7,000 jobs and equine operations tied to horse racing account for 34,000 acres of farmland in the state, according to a 2007 study. Lesniak exaggerated the impact of horse racing by incorrectly applying figures for the overall equine industry in New Jersey to one segment of that industry. But the numbers for horse racing alone -- particularly the annual economic impact figure -- are a significant portion of the statistics for the industry at large and there’s consensus about a broad impact if horse racing disappears from New Jersey.

And it certainly is true that they've grown tremendously over the past 10 years — from $23-billion in fiscal 1994 to $69.7-billion in fiscal 2006. McCain is correct that they roughly doubled from $32.9-billion in 2000 to the 2006 budget year, but he fails to acknowledge developments after that. In fiscal 2007, congressional Democrats had to complete most of the spending bills that Republicans had not finished after losing control of Congress in the 2006 elections. The Democrats declared a moratorium on most pork-barrel projects. And so in fiscal 2007, earmarked projects dropped to about $10.7-billion. The only earmarks that Congress funded were those in the Defense appropriations bill and a few in the Homeland Security measure. This year, congressional Democrats have vowed to drastically cut earmarks, and though the process is far from complete, so far it appears that Congress is on track to spend as little as $21-billion on earmarks. Skeptics say it is likely to be more, but President Bush has said he wants to cut earmarks in half. If McCain had made his claim in 2005, he'd be right. But since it's two years later and the climate for earmark spending has changed significantly, McCain's facts are out of date.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2007-10-12T00:00:00	2007-10-08	['None']
pomt-08598	Candidate for governor Roy Barnes has been "fighting hard" to let illegal immigrants vote.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/24/republican-governors-association/gop-said-candidate-roy-barnes-fought-give-illegal-/	This election season, illegal immigrants stand alongside President Barack Obama and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as among the Republicans' favorite bad guys. Now a Republican spoof attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Gov. Roy Barnes' career as an attorney said he pushed for them to break the law. At www.1888kingroy.com, sponsored by the Republican Governors Association, you'll read that "Roy Barnes has fought to give illegal immigrants the right to vote." "In other words, no ID, no problemo!" it said. And if you call 1-888-King-Roy you'll be prompted to dial 3 "if you're an illegal immigrant." It sends you to this recorded message: "Hola. As you know, Roy has been fighting hard to give you the ability to vote. If you are interested in voting, leave a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Adios. Vaya con Dios." Barnes was "fighting hard" to help illegal immigrants break the law and vote? Dios mio! If this accusation sticks, it would be a damaging blow for Barnes, a centrist running a close race with Republican candidate and former U.S. Congressman Nathan Deal. Libertarian John Monds trails them. The RGA's argument is this: For years, Georgia allowed documents such as utility bills and bank statements to serve as voter identification. In 2005, the state Legislature passed a law requiring that voters present photo identification at the polls. A revised version passed in 2006 after the first law failed legal challenges. Barnes filed a lawsuit on behalf of clients who said the legislation violated the state constitution. If the suit won, the law would not have gone into effect. That would have meant that voters could use bank statements as identification. Because Barnes was a member of an advisory board to Georgia Appleseed, a nonprofit the RGA said "specializes in efforts designed to aid illegal immigrants" and has a program to "provide advice on opening a bank account without a Social Security number," the GOP group said he was helping illegal immigrants get the vote. "Clearly if he had been successful with the lawsuit, Barnes' group, Georgia Appleseed, could have provided a roadmap for more illegal immigrants to obtain bank accounts, and therefore the necessary paperwork to vote," the website concludes. We took a closer look at the RGA's argument. Barnes was an attorney for the plaintiffs in 2006's Lake v. Perdue. The suit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court, argued that a law mandating voters to show one of six forms of government-issued photo identification at the polls violated the Georgia Constitution. The suit lost before the state Supreme Court. But according to the Secretary of State's Office and a voting expert who once served on the Fulton County Board of Registrations and Elections, if the suit had won, bank statements would have been acceptable forms of voter ID. So the RGA is correct on that count. The old law that allowed bank statements as voter IDs would have been in effect if Barnes had won. But beyond this point, the RGA's argument falls apart. For Republicans to claim Barnes fought to give illegal immigrants the right to vote, the former governor would have actually had to have pushed for it. So we took a closer look at what Barnes' lawsuit actually fought for. There is no mention of illegal immigrants in the complaint Barnes filed on behalf of his clients, much less the idea that they should have access to the polls. The suit objected to the law because it would place high obstacles to voting on the poor, elderly, and visually and physically impaired. The complaint also argued that the law treated in-person voters differently than absentee voters, who are more often white than black, and that there were better ways to prevent voter fraud. Laughlin McDonald, the Atlanta director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said that describing Barnes' lawsuit as supporting voting by illegal immigrants is a "misrepresentation of the issue." The ACLU opposed the photo ID law. Voting rights experts we consulted also agreed the RGA's characterization is incorrect. "This is really an outrageous distortion," said Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University who is an expert in voting rights. "They were instead challenging a law that raised serious legal questions, given its potential to impede voting by U.S. citizens of limited means," Tokaji said. "Whether or not one agrees with their position on the legal merits, this is a gross mischaracterization." Some argued the photo ID requirements might make it more difficult for noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to cast ballots, said Michael Pitts, a voting rights expert at the Indiana University School of Law. But this has mostly been a "side issue" in the larger debate. "The lawsuits filed against photo identification requirements have not been based on a desire to provide illegal immigrants with voting rights, rather they have been about whether certain groups of United States citizens, such as the poor, the elderly and African Americans, might be unable to cast a ballot because they do not possess the required photo identification," Pitts said. We also took a look at Barnes' connection to Georgia Appleseed, which the RGA said "specializes in efforts designed to aid illegal immigrants." If Barnes were indeed on the board of advisers of such a group, a more general claim that he supported advocacy work to aid illegal immigrants might contain some truth. Executive Director Sharon Hill confirmed that Barnes served on the group's board of directors from 2005 through 2008 and now sits on its board of advisers. Georgia Appleseed issued a news release in response to the ad saying its work is being "mischaracterized." Chuck Clay, a member of Georgia Appleseed's board of directors as well as a former chairman of the state Republican Party and Republican minority leader of the Georgia state Senate, said the group in no way specializes in helping illegal immigrants. "That would be 100 percent incorrect," Clay said. "It [the accusation] does make you scratch your head and wonder whether the people saying that looked up the [Georgia Appleseed] website." Georgia Appleseed is a public-interest law group that works to fix systemic issues in the law. The group of lawyers, civil leaders and other professionals includes leaders from both sides of the aisle. They're currently working on projects that focus on juvenile justice, effective student discipline, public education, and property passed down to heirs without a will or probate, the group's leadership and news coverage confirmed. Hill confirmed the nonprofit did run the Financial Access for Latino Immigrants project from 2005 through June 30, 2009. The financial literacy project helped newcomers avoid being victims of violent crime by keeping their money in the bank instead of in their pockets, avoid predatory lending and build economic stability. (Between 40 percent and 60 percent of Latino immigrants do not have a bank account, according to project literature.) Barnes was not directly involved in that project, Hill said. A review of the project's publications found no instance in which Georgia Appleseed gave advice to illegal immigrants on how to get a bank account without a Social Security number. One brochure did mention that the ID might not be necessary for non-U.S. citizens. But "noncitizen" includes green card holders, foreigners on work visas and international students. It's a far cry from "illegal immigrant." So not only did AJC PolitiFact Georgia find no evidence Barnes fought for the radical notion of giving illegal immigrants the right to vote, we also found that Barnes gave none of the support to illegal immigrants that the RGA claimed. Barnes' voter ID suit had nothing to do with illegal immigration. Georgia Appleseed, where he serves on an advisory board, is a group of lawyers and other professionals who perform public-interest work on a wide range of topics and does not "specialize" in aiding the activities of people who are breaking the law by entering the country. That group's program on financial literacy for Latino immigrants, which ended last year, dealt with noncitizens, not illegal immigrants. Barnes had no direct involvement in it. It would take a leap of conspiratorial proportions to believe that Barnes had fought for such an extreme position as giving illegal immigrants the right or ability to vote. The claim is silly.

pomt-02794	"We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/04/timothy-dolan/us-bishops-have-supported-universal-health-care-19/	The Catholic church and the White House have been clashing over contraception requirements in President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. As we’ve noted before, the Affordable Care Act requires Catholic hospitals to provide all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration to their employers with no out-of-pocket costs, including birth control pills, Plan B, diaphragms and hormone shots. Coverage for emergency contraception, but not abortion, is required. "Religious employers" are exempt from the requirement, but the hospitals don’t qualify for exemptions because they both employ and serve people who may not share their religious beliefs. In an interview with David Gregory on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, perhaps the most prominent member of the Catholic heirarchy in the United States, spoke out against a mandate for hospitals to provide these services, including emergency-contraception pills. At the same time, though, Dolan cited some common ground between the church and the administration it’s been battling. "We bishops have been really kind of in a tough place because we're for universal, comprehensive, life-affirming health care," Dolan said. "We, the bishops of the United States -- can you believe it -- in 1919 came out for more affordable, more comprehensive, more universal health care. That's how far back we go in this battle, okay?" We wondered whether the bishops’ support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century. Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care. During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, Father John A. Ryan, published the Bishops’ Program of Social Reconstruction, a guide to overhauling U.S. social justice. Dolan was referring to a section on social insurance, his spokesman said. "The state," the guide read, "should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age." That wasn’t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example, the group has publicly supported a variety of proposals, including former President Bill Clinton’s ultimately defeated health care plan in 1993. "The flap is over the (contraception) issue," said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. "That’s where it comes to appear that they’re against universal health care." Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years. Our ruling Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. He’s correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.

pomt-09933	Palin said stimulus money for weatherization required "universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/11/sarah-palin/palin-veto-stimulus-energy-efficiency-building-cod/	In a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on June 8, 2009, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin criticized the stimulus package as a "dizzying debt that we're handing to our kids." She said, "I vetoed a bucket of the money, not a whole lot, we did accept education dollars and infrastructure dollars, but dollars that were tied to universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska and really prohibits opportunity to build and to develop, and just wasn't going to work up there in Alaska, so I vetoed a bucket of that money. "...I don't think that it would be a healthy thing for our state to adopt because it would be a federal mandate, fixed, centralized government, telling Alaskan communities that have opted out of building codes for the most part. "Them telling us what's best for our businesses and residences, how to build them, and we're all for energy conservation. We have hundreds of millions of dollars, in fact, budgeted for programs there but we don't want those fat strings attached where centralized, big government is going to tell us what is best." We wondered if the building codes were as strict as Palin claimed. She did, in fact, veto $28.6 million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient. But many state legislators in Alaska, including some of her fellow Republicans, say Palin has overstated the strings attached to the federal money. She initially promised to take a pass on as much as a third of the stimulus money. She later agreed to take all but 3 percent — the $28.6 million she vetoed. Palin was specifically concerned with a provision in the stimulus (it is Section 410, as she will refer it later) that ties the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments "will implement" a "building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published International Energy Conservation Code, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings" as well as "a building energy code (or codes) for commercial buildings throughout the State that meets or exceeds the ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1–2007, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings." The provision also states that recipients of the federal money must implement a plan to achieve compliance with the building codes within eight years in at least 90 percent of new and renovated residential and commercial building space. That language seems pretty rigid, but then along came Missouri, which applied for the money, but instead of agreeing to the specifics of the building code, committed merely to "working with communities to create model energy efficiency standards that, if local units of government choose to implement (our emphasis), should reduce energy costs for Missourians." The Department of Energy approved the application. So Palin's chief of staff wrote to the Department of Energy to get some clarification about what exactly Alaska would be committing itself to if it accepted the money. In response, Steven G. Chalk of the DOE said the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes, and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes. In those cases, Chalk wrote, it's sufficient for the governor to simply "promote" the codes. It is enough, he wrote, for the state to work with local governments to create model energy efficiency standards, but no municipality would be forced to adopt any new codes. As for Palin's claims of "one-size-fits-all" building codes, Chalk wrote that the provision "provides flexibility with regard to building codes" and "expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings." So Palin is wrong. The municipalities are not forced to accept the specific standards and, given that local governments set their own codes, the feds would be satisfied if Alaska merely promoted such building codes. Despite these assurances from the Department of Energy, Palin vetoed the money and insisted the provision amounted to "big brother" government involvement. The state legislature is now threatening to pursue a very rare veto override. In a May 29, 2009, letter published in the Anchorage Daily News , Palin said, "Alaskans have a strong history of independence and opposition to Washington, D.C., meddling in local issues. Our constitution ensures 'maximum local self-government.' Our communities have had the option to adopt building codes for decades. Most have not done so. "Alaska communities have the right to determine for themselves whether to adopt building codes," she wrote. "I asked the feds to clarify their position. The Department of Energy finally admitted section 410 and their previous statements were 'inappropriate' for some states but still wanted an agreement to push model codes on all Alaskan communities. I said no. "Beware of Washington, D.C., trying to cajole local community leaders to eliminate the choices Alaskans have when building or renovating homes and businesses. These new codes are so detailed they would dictate the kinds of lights that can be installed in a home in Akutan, and how thick window panes must be in Chignik." But that's not what the DOE letter said. While it did say the governor should "promote" more energy-efficient building codes, local municipalities were under no obligation to implement new codes. And the letter was also very clear that it was not mandating a "one-size-fits-all" code, that local governments could tailor their own unique codes to meet their needs so long as the standards achieved similar energy savings. In other words, accepting the money would not have dictated "the kinds of lights that can be installed in a home in Akutan, and how thick window panes must be in Chignik." A strict reading of the requirements for the energy-efficiency money might give credence to Palin's concerns. But the experience of Missouri and the explicit letter from the Department of Energy to Palin's office made clear the feds are not imposing a "one-size-fits-all" building code. Palin sounds like someone looking for a fight when there isn't one. We find her statement to be False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-06-11T18:07:53	2009-06-08	['Alaska', 'Sarah_Palin']
pomt-01409	"Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap," which amounts to "a $500,000 vagina tax" over her working career.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/10/sarah-silverman/fact-checking-sarah-silvermans-viral-vagina-tax-vi/	Liberal comedian and activist Sarah Silverman isn’t one for discretion, especially when she’s out to make a political point about money and genitalia. Silverman mused about the "wage gap" in a new video launching a fundraising campaign for the National Women’s Law Center. The wage gap refers to the difference between what men and women earn. In the video, Silverman’s solution to mismatched earnings is to get a sex change. That’s a joke, but she ticked off statistics that were not. (The video itself is a little NSFW, but here it is if you’re interested.) "Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap," Silverman says as she sits on a doctor’s exam table in a hospital gown, waiting for her faux sex-change consultation. "Over the course of the working years of her life, that's almost 500 grand." And, in a phrase you’re not likely to soon forget, she realizes, "That's a $500,000 vagina tax." Let’s peel the curtain on what men and women earn. Is it really a half-million dollar difference? What the numbers say The National Women’s Law Center didn’t get back to us, but an FAQ on the group’s website shows the math. To arrive at Silverman’s $500,000 vagina tax, she used 2013 Census income and poverty data for the median earnings of full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up, regardless of occupation. The median wage was $39,157 for women and $50,033 for men. The average difference is $10,876, which rounds up to Silverman’s $11,000. This is basically the same calculation politicians made in 2012 to claim that the average woman makes 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. As PolitiFact, PunditFact and other fact-checkers have noted in earlier examinations, the figure should be used with caution. It’s hard to say for whom this would be the case, but it’s "a summary measure, just like anything else would be," said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. "It may not be experienced in reality by any one person, but that doesn’t make it wrong," said University of Maryland sociology professor Philip Cohen. "It is the average experience, which is meaningful." Then, Silverman multiplied $11,000 by 40 years to get to $440,000. Why they picked 40 years we’re not sure. There’s no official government figure for the length of the average American career. In the video, $440,000 becomes almost $500,000. So you can see there already is some generous rounding, as a "tax" that should be $435,040 over 40 years (in present day dollars) becomes almost $500,000. That’s worth noting, but it’s not the only point of caution. Other figures for earnings by gender The Census is not the only available source of earnings by gender. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks average annual weekly median earnings of full-time salary workers using the Current Population Survey. In 2013, median weekly earnings for women were $706, or $39,520 a year. Men brought in $860 a week, or $44,720 a year. This produces a much smaller average annual earnings difference of $5,200, which using Silverman’s calculation, would translate to $208,000 over a career, not $500,000. Looking at a one-year snapshot Silverman’s calculation also is only based on a one-year look, when experts said an examination of a longer period of time would be more useful. "I think the average does help, but I'd rather see the lifetime earnings calculated for the mean and median female worker rather than extrapolating from the average for one year," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. The primary difference between the Census and BLS data is BLS does not include self-employed workers. Meanwhile, the Census does not include some other workers, such as teachers and seasonal and construction workers. Men work more hours Some economists, such as those at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer to examine hourly wages by gender because it includes part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, who are more often women. In 2012, the latest year for which data is available, median hourly earnings for women were $11.99. For men, it was $13.88. But hourly data is not without its drawbacks, as it does not account for salaried workers, which typically earn more than hourly workers. Also, women tend to work fewer hours than men, which could mean that part of the reason men earn more is because they work more. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men worked 8.34 hours a day on average in 2013. Women worked 7.73 hours a day on average in 2013. Over the course of 40 years, that’s about a 6,000-hour, or more than 700-day difference (without factoring in vacation, etc.) "At a minimum, I think Sarah Silverman should calculate the tax on being female after adjusting for the number of working hours required to earn the average man’s and the average woman’s annual pay," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "That would still leave a tax, but it would be a smaller one if Ms. Silverman did indeed forget to adjust for hours worked." Unpacking the gap Economists also bristled at Silverman’s suggestion that the gap would disappear if she were a man. It’s widely understood that the wage gap is not entirely due to gender discrimination. There are a lot of ways to consider the numbers, and the gap shrinks as workers are compared by similar levels of education, occupation and experience. Nurses and cashiers, for example, have closer pay parity. Still, a gap persists. A 2012 report from the American Association of University Women found a 7 percent "unexplained" pay gap among full-time workers one year after graduating from college in 2009, even when they made similar career and education decisions. Part of it is career choice, research suggests. More women populate lower-wage jobs than men, more often choosing jobs as receptionists, grade-school teachers and nurses, for example, while men disproportionately select jobs as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. Another factor is the time women take to have children and care for them. Cohen argues that even if women choose to have children or work fewer hours, it is still fair to consider their lifestyle choice a "tax." "You might be opting into that lifestyle, and still it has a cost," he said, comparing it to a cigarette tax. One final note: PolitiFact typically frowns upon people deeming something a "tax" when it really isn't. In this case, we think it's clear Silverman is using "tax" as part of a punchline and not referring to a literal government levy on women. So we won't split hairs on this term in our rating. Our ruling Silverman said, "Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap," which amounts to "a $500,000 vagina tax" over her working career. A bulletproof number to illustrate the gender gap remains elusive, and Silverman’s "vagina tax" is a lifetime estimate based on a one-year average. The economists we spoke to were leery of the $11,000 figure, to a point, and similarly leery of the math to reach $500,000. There are just too many variables to describe the lifetime income-earning potential of "the average woman." That said, most experts say a pay gap does exist, though it’s smaller when you compare workers with similar experience and education. It’s just that pinpointing specific numbers is problematic. Silverman’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06682	The Massachusetts health care plan "dealt with 8 percent of our population," far less than the "100 percent of American people" affected by President Barack Obama’s health care law.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-his-health-care-bill-affected-far-smal/	During a Sep. 5, 2011, Republican presidential candidate forum in South Carolina sponsored by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., Mitt Romney defended the health care overhaul he signed into law when he was governor of Massachusetts, seeking to contrast it with the health care law signed by President Barack Obama last year. DeMint, who was one of the political figures questioning candidates at his forum, asked Romney if he wished to discuss the health care law he signed as governor in 2006 -- a law that has been controversial among many Republicans, who argue that it represents too deep an intrusion by government into the health care system. "As you know, if you're our nominee, the president is going to say that you implemented Obamacare in Massachusetts," DeMint said to Romney. Romney responded, "That will be one of my best assets if I'm able to debate President Obama, as I hope to be able to do, by saying, 'Mr. President, you give me credit for what you've tried to copy in some ways. Our bill dealt with 8 percent of our population, the people who aren't insured and said to them, if you can pay, don't count on the government, take personal responsibility. We didn't raise taxes, Mr. President. You raise taxes $500 billion. We didn't cut Medicare. One president in modern history cut Medicare'.... And the critical thing is this, … we dealt with 8 percent." Then, addressing Obama’s law, Romney continued, "He dealt with 100 percent of American people. He said I'm going to change health care for all of you. It's simply unconstitutional. It's bad law. It's bad medicine, and on Day One of my administration, I will direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from Obamacare to all 50 states. It has got to be stopped, and I know it better than most." Romney’s comment offers a lot of facts to consider, but we’re focusing here on a specific comparison Romney made -- that the Massachusetts health care plan "dealt with 8 percent of our population," which was far less than the "100 percent of American people" affected by the health care law enacted with support from Obama. First, some background on the two health care laws. Previously, we’ve concluded that the Massachusetts plan and the Obama plan are similar. We even did a quiz: Romneycare & Obamacare -- can you tell the difference? Both laws leave in place the major existing insurance systems -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help people with moderate incomes buy insurance, using voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. Under both laws, individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance to employees must pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. Romney's press office did not respond to an inquiry about his statement. But in drawing his contrast at the forum, Romney focused on two related issues: the laws’ efforts to cover the uninsured and the use of the individual mandate to achieve that goal. When Romney said that his bill "dealt with 8 percent of our population, the people who aren't insured," he was using as his yardstick the percentage of people in Massachusetts without health insurance. When you look back to the period when the bill was passed, Romney’s figure for uninsured residents is basically right. According to Census Bureau data compiled by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and the Urban Institute, 8.9 percent of Massachusetts residents were uninsured in the period 2006-07. But if you measure the comparable number of uninsured Americans at the time the federal law was enacted, it obviously was not anywhere close to the 100 percent Romney claims. According to the Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans without health insurance nationally was slightly under 17 percent in 2009, the year Obama began pushing for the bill. According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, the number was about the same in 2010, when the measure was signed into law. Other estimates have pegged the national number at about 15 percent. Meanwhile, Romney said that Obama’s law "dealt with 100 percent of American people." That’s not exactly correct -- the law allows a few categories of people to opt out of the individual mandate, primarily those for whom it would be a financial hardship. But it’s not too far off. However, if that’s the standard, then the two bills are quite similar. The Massachusetts plan has affordability and religious exemptions for the individual mandate that echo those in the federal law, so both laws would affect something approaching 100 percent of the population, even if not exactly 100 percent. Comparing 8 percent to 17 percent "would have been apples to apples," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and a critic of the federal health care law, agreed. To be consistent, he said, Obama’s plan only impacted 15 percent to 17 percent of the U.S population. "Romney appears to be suggesting that his bill only impacted the uninsured in Massachusetts. Not true, as I have written," Tanner said. "You can only get to those numbers by assuming that the only relevant part of either bill is the individual mandate and that only the currently uninsured are impacted by the mandate. Neither of those premises is true." Our ruling Given the unpopularity of the federal health care law within the Republican base, it’s understandable that Romney is trying to show primary voters that the law he signed is different from the one Obama signed. However, Romney’s example is specious -- a felony case of comparing apples and oranges. Either both laws affected something approaching 100 percent of the populace, or they affected about 8 percent (in Massachusetts) and 17 percent (in the U.S. as a whole). Romney is mixing two completely different things together to make a point that simply isn't valid.. The way Romney phrased it, listeners would be led to believe that the reach of the federal law is vastly wider than that of the Massachusetts law. In reality, on the question of covering the uninsured through an individual mandate -- the specific criterion Romney used in his comments -- the percentages of people affected aren’t wildly divergent.

pomt-01509	Georgia can substantially increase its funding for education by going after $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/23/jason-carter/carters-plan-go-after-tax-cheats-has-challenges/	Education eats up the largest share of the state budget, so it only makes sense that it’s consuming much of the debate in the neck-and-neck governor’s race. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent, says his efforts to grow jobs and the economy have paid off for schools. Hs education track record also includes work for passage of a 2012 charter school amendment and a bipartisan deal to shore up the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-K programs. His challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, contends that Deal has shortchanged Georgia’s children. He’s most critical of $1-billion-a-year-plus austerity cuts to education recommended by Deal in the first three of his four state budgets. Carter, who voted for those three budgets, is promising that, if he’s elected, he will increase education spending through a three-pronged approach that involves growing the economy, cutting government waste and going after tax cheats. The latter proposal peaked the interest of our fact-checkers. We reached out to the Carter for evidence to back up the candidate’s claim. Spokesman Bryan Thomas pointed us to a January report from the state Department of Audits and Account, showing about $4.4 billion in delinquent state taxes. The report’s authors estimate that $1.9 billion of the $4.4 billion is uncollected. But Thomas said strong leadership would improve collection of that money. "You put the force of the governor’s office behind it," Thomas told The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month. At a press conference on Aug. 27th, Carter told reporters; "There’s $2.5 billion that is uncollected out there from people who are cheating on their taxes, and against whom we aren’t enforcing the law." The auditor’s report, points out that about $815 million of the $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old – making it much harder to collect. Of course, that leaves two-thirds of the money apparently there for the taking, right? The left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute isn’t so sure the plan is viable. Executive Director Alan Essig points out that once you account for the people and businesses that lack the means to pay, you’re left with people who have intentionally dodged their responsibilities. Even when caught, those scofflaws aren’t likely to fork over the entire amount owed. Ramping up enforcement will yield more money, but just how much is unclear, he said. "Are we talking about $3 million, $30 million, $300 million?" Essig said. "I don’t know what the dollar amount is, and I don’t think anyone knows it." Carter’s proposal to track down delinquent taxpayers is nothing new. Georgia made probably its biggest push to go after tax cheats when Sonny Perdue was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner. We pulled a report that showed Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers that owed a combined $1.6 billion as of September 2003. Some of that debt dated back to 1988. Graham’s agency chased down the money on several fronts. For instance, $23 million came in when the state refused to renew alcohol licenses for businesses with outstanding taxes. Another $18.6 million came in when the state began shaming scofflaws by posting their names on the internet. All told, the state’s two-year vigorous enforcement campaign collected $172.5 million – just 11 percent of what was owed. "This is a messier process than (Carter) is suggesting," said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in public budgeting and finance. "There is no automatic money that comes in once letters go out." That’s because collection would be handled through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that give state agencies broad powers to enforce taxation give people the right to appeal, Neuby said. The hearing process can take months and years, especially if the delinquents hire attorneys to fight enforcement. There is also the matter that some delinquent taxpayers may have legitimate reasons they have not paid – and therefore do not actually owe, Neuby said. State House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, said there are complications, even if the state could collect the amount in back taxes that Carter’s claiming. "Nobody would argue putting it into education," England said. "But that’s one -time funds." The question becomes: What about the next year? he said. We circled back out to Thomas about some of the concerns that were expressed. "Sen. Carter has never said that this is the only way to pay for the education investments we need," Thomas said. "He has identified it as one of several ways to invest in our schools." Other efforts, such as cutting waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustained funding for schools, Thomas said. So where does this leave us? Carter said he believes the state can collect a substantial amount to help education by going after delinquent taxpayers. The state’s experience – and a report from state auditors – say that may be more challenging than he suggests. Carter has a point. But there’s there’s a lot of context missing from his proposal.

pomt-09580	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison “voted to continue Roe v. Wade.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/27/rick-perry/perry-says-hutchison-voted-roe-v-wade/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison’s record on abortion makes some Republicans uncomfortable, so it was no surprise that it came up during the Jan. 14 Republican gubernatorial debate. Gov. Rick Perry invoked abortion to try to illustrate what he called the senator’s “issues with inconsistency.” “You voted to continue Roe v. Wade,” Perry said to Hutchison. Hutchison, who said during the debate that she always comes down on the “side of life,” has not always voted in ways that please two state groups, Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life's political action committee, which have endorsed Perry. Nor have Hutchison's votes on abortion issues satisfied some abortion rights advocates. "She's voted for every unreasonable restriction in the book," Donna Crane, policy director for National Abortion Rights Action League Pro-Choice America, said through a spokeswoman. Historically, the senator has supported abortion rights, with restrictions. Her campaign points to her record of voting for legislation limiting the procedure, including the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. To Texans watching the debate, Perry’s statement on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, may have seemed odd. That’s because Congress can’t vote to overturn a Supreme Court decision based on a constitutional right, University of Texas law professor Scot Powe said. Congress could, however, act to amend the U.S. Constitution to prohibit abortions. But for an amendment to become law, it must be passed by two-thirds of both houses of Congress and be ratified by three-fourths of the states. That hasn’t happened. We wondered what vote the governor was referring to during the debate. His campaign pointed us to a 2003 vote that Hutchison cast for a resolution expressing support for Roe v. Wade. The resolution, an amendment to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, expressed "the sense of the Senate that (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade … was appropriate and secures an important constitutional right; and (2) such decision should not be overturned.” In and of themselves, such "sense of the Senate" resolutions enact no laws, spend no public funds and are largely symbolic. The resolution was not included in the final version of the bill in Congress. The late-term ban was later upheld by the Supreme Court. In 2003, Hutchison told the Dallas Morning News that she "thought it was a very clean amendment that said Roe v. Wade has evolved into allowing reasonable restrictions to be put on by states, while also allowing women in the early stages (of pregnancy) to have that capability, if that is what they and their doctors decide." When asked this week about her vote, Hutchison's campaign said that the senator believes states should be able to keep their ability to restrict abortion and that the amendment sent that statement. However, the only reference that the 2003 resolution made to state restrictions was the observation that Roe v. Wade actually limits "the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy." During the gubernatorial debate, Hutchison voiced a different concern: that overturning Roe v. Wade would lead to "abortion havens" because some states would pass looser laws on abortion while others would outlaw the practice altogether. Hutchison was among 17 senators, including six Republicans, who voted both for the ban on the late-term procedure and the resolution affirming Roe. While critics have called those dual votes an attempt by lawmakers to appeal to both sides in the abortion debate, Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, disagrees. Supporting restrictions on abortion while recognizing that access to abortion services is needed in some cases actually reflects the moderate views most Americans have on the issue, he said. "The idea that pro-choice means unrestricted access to abortion services and that pro-life means that life begins at conception and therefore abortion is murder are the poles in this debate," Jillson said. "But there’s a vast middle ground. And for two-thirds of America, that's where they live." Summing up: On its face, Perry's statement that Hutchison "voted to continue Roe v. Wade" is wrong because senators have no such power regarding Supreme Court decisions. If Perry had substituted "affirm" for "continue," the statement would have been accurate, though perhaps less politically potent. But the brunt of Perry's charge is correct: Sen. Hutchison voted for a resolution that said Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. We rate his statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03007	Ann Kuster turned "a blind eye to those in need of funding" by voting "against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/oct/16/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-ann-kuster-turned-blind-eye-those-ne/	As the government shutdown continues into its third week, Republicans and Democrats are still exchanging jabs over who is to blame. The National Republican Congressional Committee -- the campaign arm of House Republicans -- asks Americans in a recent web video to tell U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H., along with six other House Democrats, to end what it calls partisan gamesmanship. In the accompanying news release, NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek said Kuster "has turned her back on women, children and our nation’s veterans throughout President Obama’s shutdown, and it’s time for her and her liberal allies to stop the partisan games." "The House has passed bipartisan bills to help the American people while the shutdown continues, and Kuster has continued to turn a blind eye to those in need of funding." The other Democratic lawmakers targeted by the ads are U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut, Bill Enyart of Illinois, Ann Kirkpartick of Arizona, and Rick Nolan and Tim Walz of Minnesota. The NRCC’s video draws on a series of House measures that would have opened specific portions of the government even as the larger shutdown continued. When those measures came up for consideration in the House, Kuster "voted against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health," the NRCC says. We wondered if Kuster did indeed vote against funding for programs that support veterans and low-income families, groups for which she’s pledged her support. We turned to the House roll call votes for the topics highlighted by the National Republican Congressional Committee. In recent weeks, Kuster -- along with virtually every Democrat -- has voted no on the following resolutions. All of these measures would have given agencies in question the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2013, which ended Sept. 30. The resolutions would have extended funding through Dec. 15. • House Joint Resolution 72 to approve a continuing resolution for veterans benefits. The resolution passed 259 to 157. • House Joint Resolution 77 to provide money for the Food and Drug Administration. The resolution passed 235 to 162. • House Joint Resolution 75 to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. The resolution passed 244 to 164. • House Joint Resolution 73 to give money to the National Institutes of Health. The resolution passed 254 to 171. • House Joint Resolution 59 to approve continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014. The resolution first passed on Sept. 20, in a 230 to 189 vote. Kuster voted against the resolution on that date and on two other dates when the House approved Senate amendments to the resolution. Democratic lawmakers have said they won’t support budget bills that cherry-pick which agencies or departments receive money. Each resolution above passed along strong party lines, as have most of the resolutions that would have directed money to specific departments without ending the shutdown. In addition, President Barack Obama has promised to veto any such legislation that makes it to his desk. In other words, this has been a unified Democratic strategy to fund the entire government, rather than offering piecemeal funding for limited portions of the government proposed by House Republicans. Kuster offered this rationale when we asked her to explain why she voted no on the resolutions highlighted by the NRCC. Rob Friedlander, a Kuster spokesman, said the congresswoman believes the right way to support students, veterans, small businesses and middle-class families is to reopen the entire government. He pointed to a recent opinion piece Kuster wrote. In that op-ed, Kuster argues that piecemeal funding isn’t a solution to the shutdown because it would leave much of the government closed. "Let me be perfectly clear: these measures are not solutions. They’re cynical political ploys. They’re half-hearted half-measures. They’re empty gestures that attempt to create the appearance of progress where none exists," she wrote. Friedlander also said that groups representing some of the constituencies named by the NRCC have said they, too, oppose legislation that funds individual agencies in place of reopening the government with a full budget. In a letter to U.S. House and Senate leaders, veterans representatives said that short-term continuing resolutions for the Veterans Administration aren’t acceptable because they don’t take into account the effects of inflation, increased demand for services or costs of starting new programs. The letter was co-authored by leaders of AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Veterans of Foreign Wars. The groups had more nuanced views on the specific bill -- H.J.R. 72 -- that would have provided money for disability checks and survivors compensation but not reopen other Veterans Administration offices, including information technology, medical research and National Cemetery Administration. The Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans and Veterans of Foreign Wars did not take an official position on the measure, but the groups, to varying degrees, expressed dissatisfaction with that model of legislation. "That (resolution), in general, is bad policy," said Carl Blake, legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, which expressed the clearest discomfort of the four groups about the short-term funding approach. Meanwhile, a news release from the American Public Health Association said that while the group supports the important research done through the National Institutes of Health, it "opposes efforts to fund individual agencies at the expense of others." Finally, the National WIC Association, which advocates for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), opposed House Joint Resolution 75. While that resolution would have given money for nutrition assistance to low-income women and children, the association called the resolution a way to use mothers and young children as pawns for political ends, and said the program has enough money to operate through October, giving lawmakers enough time to agree on a full budget. The National Republican Congressional Committee said Kuster's votes speak for themselves. "It’s a fact that Kuster voted against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health," said NRCC spokesman Daniel Scarpinato. "Don’t take my word for it, or some other organization, just take a look at the votes cited in the release." We disagree; in this case, the context matters. Our ruling The NRCC said that Kuster has turned "a blind eye to those in need of funding" by voting "against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health." The NRCC is correct that Kuster did vote against each of the resolutions that would have temporarily provided funding for veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health. However this only tells part of the story. The Democrats say they are pushing for a measure to fund all of government, not just a few pieces chosen by House Republicans. Notably, a number of advocacy groups whose funding Koster is accused of turning a "blind eye" to, are actually on the record saying they agree with Democrats that the government should be funded in its entirety and for a longer period of time, rather than in a short-term and piecemeal fashion.

pomt-08139	The city of Atlanta ranks 25th among U.S. cities with the highest crime rates.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/07/cq-press-city-crime-rankings-2010-2011/atlanta-ranks-25th-crime-ranking/	Atlanta may be the city too busy to hate. But for crime, we make time. The city ranks 25th of 400 cities in what's widely described as the annual "Most Dangerous Cities" list. St. Louis is No. 1. Last year, Atlanta was 18th. So while we still rate among high-crime cities such as Detroit and Baltimore, we're safer than we used to be. Or are we? In terms of crime, is Atlanta's really getting better? And was it that bad to begin with? We looked at the same 2009 FBI data used by the crime ranking. These numbers predate high-profile attacks in the Virginia-Highland neighborhood and elsewhere in recent weeks. Violent crimes reported to or uncovered by Atlanta police dropped from about 14 percent between 2008 and 2009. Property crime fell by about 12 percent. Crime is dropping nationally, too, but more slowly, the data said. The problem is this: The FBI warns against ranking cities. Doing so leads to "simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents," its website says. CQ Press' list has been at the center of the ranking controversy. Until recent years, Morgan Quitno Press, a small Lawrence, Kan., publisher, released the ranking along with a thick book of crime statistics. The publisher called it the "Most Dangerous Cities" list. Although there's little consensus among criminologists on how to compare crime between cities, leaders of the American Society of Criminology agreed on this: The ranking deserved condemnation. The group passed a resolution in 2007 that called it "invalid, damaging, and irresponsible." "They fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates, the mismeasurement of crime, large community differences in crime within cities, and the factors affecting individuals' crime risk," it read. What's worse, Morgan Quitno kept its methodology secret. Criminologists had no way of verifying or analyzing the results. That same year, CQ Press, which is known for printing authoritative material on government and policy, bought Morgan Quitno. It responded to criticism by making big changes, including hiring Rachel Boba, a Florida Atlantic University criminologist. CQ dumped the ranking's "Most Dangerous Cities" name. It also revealed its methodology. A city's crime score is based on murders, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor vehicle thefts reported in cities with populations of 75,000 or more. CQ computes the differences between city and national crime rates for each offense, then basically adds them together to determine a city's score. A higher score means higher crime. This year, Atlanta's score is 168.53. First-place St. Louis scored 381.62. Although this is a very basic type of analysis, it can be useful, Boba said. Since it compares city rates with the national average, it can help agencies flag issues that need further scrutiny. When combined with other statistics in the 388-page book, the rankings are also a useful entry point for people who want a snapshot of a city's crime, she said. But these numbers need to be used very carefully, Boba stressed. The ranking's old name was incorrect. It does not show whether a city is "safe" or "dangerous," she said, or that a resident of one city would be safer if he moved elsewhere. A person's risk of becoming a victim often depends on whether he frequents high-crime neighborhoods and how he spends his time, Boba said. Richard Rosenfeld, former head of the American Society of Criminology and a professor with the University of Missouri-St. Louis, goes further. Some city streets are as safe as suburban ones, and what city you're in has little to do with whether you become a crime victim. "You learn next to nothing of a person's risk for becoming a victim of crime by what city they're in," Rosenfeld said. Although the book addresses this issue, the news release for the 2010 ranking does not expressly discuss the reason for the name change or warn media against calling the ranking the "Most Dangerous Cities" list. CQ's ranking also does not say why crime is higher or lower from one community to the next. Those issues are "beyond the scope of this book," as Boba wrote in its introduction. Plus, cities with different rankings may have very similar crime rates. Atlanta would have dropped off the Top 25 entirely if its score were just four points lower. The list has other limitations. We discussed CQ's methodology with Rosenfeld and Georgia State University professor Robert R. Friedmann, who studies ways to improve crime statistics. Friedmann, who has been critical of rankings, said that CQ's general approach has been around for some time. It's not invalid, but specialists are dissatisfied with it. The CQ rankings report is often misused or misconstrued and does not tell a city what it needs to do to lower crime. "I cannot say what they say is true or not true," Friedmann said. "The question is whether what they do is meaningful." The ranking weighs auto theft equally with homicide, Rosenfeld notes. Also, many cities would fare much better or worse if their boundaries included larger or more representative portions of the metro area. Rosenfeld and Friedmann issue their own ranking, which adjusts a city's homicide rate for socioeconomic factors such as age, the number of single-mother heads of household and poverty rate that are common in neighborhoods with high crime. Their ranking shows whether a city's homicide rate matches expectations and tells policy-makers what social problems they need to tackle to help prevent violence. To sum up: CQ's analysis is neither invalid nor incorrect. Using its math, Atlanta does rank as 25th among cities with the highest scores for crime rate. But as one of its authors acknowledges, the number does not mean Atlanta's residents are in more danger than those in other cities. She and other experts emphasize that a person's safety is more dependent on his lifestyle and what neighborhoods he frequents than the city he's in. Although the list's name was changed, the book addresses this point while its news release did not. And the message has not stuck with the public. Because the news release does not tackle the list's misuse head on, we conclude the statement meets AJC PolitiFact Georgia's definition of Half True. It was accurate but left out important details or took things out of context.	None	CQ Press City Crime Rankings, 2010-2011	None	None	None	2010-12-07T06:00:00	2010-11-22	['United_States', 'Atlanta']
pomt-14478	The Every Student Succeeds Act "did away basically with Common Core."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/feb/29/john-mccain/common-core-no-more/	President Barack Obama signed sweeping education reform into law in December that gives states more freedom to develop their own K-12 education standards. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, highlighted this bipartisan legislation as a 2015 accomplishment in a Jan. 4 interview with the Daily Courier in Prescott. The Every Student Succeeds Act replaces the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Unlike No Child Left Behind, the new law singles out the Common Core State Standards. Common Core refers to guidelines in English and math that aim to make children more prepared for college, borne out of suggestions from education officials and nonprofit groups across the country starting in 2009. States were never required to use Common Core standards, but having standards in place earned states points for a share of federal dollars in the Obama administration’s Race to the Top grants. Although, some states received funding without adopting Common Core. Common Core has become politically unpopular among conservatives in recent years, with leaders from Wisconsin to Florida to Arizona trying to move away from them. In the interview, McCain argued that the new law nixes Common Core. "It did away basically with Common Core," McCain is quoted as saying of the Every Student Succeeds Act in the Daily Courier article. Is Common Core really no more? We decided to test McCain’s claim. Local control The Every Student Succeeds Act mentions Common Core several times. The part McCain is talking about reads: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a State from withdrawing from the Common Core State Standards or from otherwise revising their standards." In other words, the law says states can choose whatever standards they seek fit. McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo pointed this out when we asked about McCain’s remarks, noting that "states are now free to decide what academic standards they will maintain." But is that so different from what they could do before? U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jo Ann Webb said that Common Core was never a federal mandate. States did so voluntarily, as we’ve reported before. Still, part of the criteria for Obama’s Race to the Top program was states having college readiness standards such as Common Core. States were free to adopt their own standards, but they had to prove those standards prepared students for college and work to get a share of billions in federal funding. Race to the Top ended last year. The Every Student Succeeds Act makes it clear that the federal government cannot mandate standards such as Common Core, though Common Core would still be acceptable. The law also prohibits the government, through grants, contracts or other agreements, from taking any action against a state that "exercises its rights" to choose its own standards. Arizona’s State Board of Education took a symbolic vote on Common Core in October 2015, repealing its standards in a 6-2 decision. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas, who oversees K-12 education across the state, said after the vote that Arizona is smart enough to "control the education of our own children." More than three months later, department spokesman Charles Tack said the state is still in the process of developing its own standards. Arizona still has Common Core in place for this school year. We asked other education experts about the senior senator’s statement. Michael Petrilli is the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a Washington D.C.-based education policy think tank. He said the new law allows states to control their own education policies, but it doesn’t exactly do away with Common Core. "He (McCain) was imprecise," Petrilli said. "It would have been to correct to say that the act eliminates any relationship between Common Core and the federal government, and that’s important." Gerard Robinson, the former education commissioner of Florida and an education policy fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said McCain is speaking to the fact that the Every Student Succeeds Act allows states to have more "decision-making over education." Cornell University associate professor John Sipple, who specializes in education policy, said McCain’s statement is misleading, but he echoed similar comments about choice. "States are on their own. They’re welcome to choose the Common Core, they’re welcome to choose another opportunity," Sipple said. More than 40 states currently have Common Core State Standards. However, a number of states are revising their education standards. For example, Kansas, West Virginia and Alabama all have bills in their legislatures to repeal Common Core. Our ruling McCain said the Every Student Succeeds Act "did away basically with Common Core." The Every Student Succeeds Act does not do away with Common Core. Common Core still exists in states throughout the country. A state can still decide whether or not they want to implement those standards, or create their own. The new law prevents the federal government from mandating what a state decides to do with its specific education policies, such as requiring Common Core. The government did not, however, require states to adopt Common Core before this law. For oversimplifying complex education policy, we rate McCain’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-02047	"Rhode Island has the highest dropout rate in New England at twenty-three percent."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/01/clay-pell/clay-pell-says-rhode-island-has-highest-dropout-ra/	In Clay Pell’s education plan, "Seizing the Future: A World-Class Education For All," and in a May 5 email to his subscriber list, the Democratic candidate for governor states that Rhode Island has the highest high school dropout rate in New England, at 23 percent. There are two parts to this claim. We’ll start with whether the dropout rate is really 23 percent. The "Seizing the Future" education plan, which Pell released April 30, 2014, attributes the 23 percent dropout figure to a report issued April 28 by GradNation, a campaign of the nonprofit America’s Promise Alliance that strives to lower the nation’s high school dropout rate. We checked out the report, "Building a GradNation: Progress and Challenge in Ending the High School Dropout Epidemic (2014)." It gives Rhode Island’s four-year "Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rate" at 77 percent, for 2011-2012. That’s the lowest graduation rate in New England, according to the report. Comparatively, Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts have a graduation rate of 85 percent; New Hampshire is at 86 percent, and Vermont at 88 percent. You may ask, what the heck is an adjusted cohort graduation rate? And why should we care? A cohort is a group of subjects who share an event during a particular time span. The adjusted cohort graduation rate refers to the percentage of students in a given group who successfully finish high school in four years with a diploma, accounting for transfers in and out of the system. It’s a relatively new measure all states are required to use. But we couldn’t find Pell’s 23 percent dropout figure in the GradNation report. We asked Pell’s campaign manager, Devin T. Driscoll, if they arrived at that figure by subtracting the 77 percent graduation rate from 100 percent. Driscoll said yes. But guess what, class! The answer is not that simple; and the Pell folks made a basic mistake. "The dropout rate is not an inverse of the graduation rate," says Marie T. Stetser, of the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education. Stetser directed us to a report she co-authored, "Public High School Four-Year On-Time Graduation Rates and Event Dropout Rates: School Years 2010-11 and 2011-2012." The GradNation report uses these same NCES statistics. "Counts of students who have not graduated on time with a regular high school diploma do include dropouts, but also include those who will earn a regular diploma in more than four years, and those who have or will earn alternative credentials," the report states. For example, students who have stayed back one or more grades in high school but eventually graduate, and students in GED programs would be included. Also, students who have simultaneously enrolled in high school and secondary school may take more than four years to graduate, and will receive a high school diploma and an associate’s degree when they finish. So how far off is the Pell campaign’s 23-percent dropout estimate? Roughly by half, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education. The state’s average high school dropout rate was 11.9 percent for 2011-12, says spokesman Elliot Krieger. He explains that the remainder at that time were in either GED programs (3.2 percent) or still in school (7.8 percent), adding up to the 23 percent figure the Pell campaign came up with. "The key point is that each year a certain number or percentage of students graduate – but the remaining students are not all dropouts …," he said. Krieger notes that the state’s high school graduation rate for 2012-2013 rose three points, to 80 percent. NCES is currently working on its 2013 statistics, so we don’t know how that compares with other states. What about the second part of Pell’s claim, that Rhode Island’s dropout rate is the highest in New England? On that question, he seems to be on track. The data is a little difficult to follow, so bear with us. The NCES measures the high school "event dropout rate," which is the percentage of students who were enrolled in 9-12th grade the previous year who did not return to school or graduate. It excludes those, for example, who did not return because they were temporarily absent for suspension or illness, or who transferred to another district. It is a different population than the four-year cohort. By that measure, Rhode Island, at 4.2 percent for 2011-2012, had the highest event dropout rate in New England. Connecticut’s event dropout rate was 2.1 percent; Maine: 3.2 percent; Mass.: 2.5; New Hampshire: 1.3; and Vermont: 2.5. In 2010-2011, Rhode Island’s event dropout rate was 5.2 - and still the leader of the pack. Driscoll, Pell’s campaign manager, said the campaign did more research after being contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, and recognized that the shortcut it took to find a dropout rate was in error. "It seems fair to say that, in our efforts to draw attention to the critical problem of Rhode Island’s alarming high school graduation and dropout rates, we did not use the standard calculation of the dropout percentage," Driscoll wrote in an email. "But the fact remains: Rhode Island does have the highest dropout rate in New England (and the Northeast)." In the future, he said, the campaign plans to use the NCES statistics when talking about dropout rates. Our ruling Clay Pell said, "Rhode Island has the highest dropout rate in New England at twenty-three percent." The campaign made an error in calculating the dropout rate, which, according to the Rhode Island Department of Education was actually 11.9 percent in 2011-12, the latest year for which figures were available. But the state did have the highest "event dropout rate" in New England, according to federal statistics. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-12558	Says a Texas Senate committee considering "private school voucher" legislation randomly called people to testify regardless of when the people submitted requests to testify.	true	/texas/statements/2017/apr/14/sara-stevenson/sara-stevenson-austin-says-texas-senate-panel-rand/	An Austin resident declared that a Texas Senate panel randomly called witnesses to testify at a crucial hearing no matter how early people turned in requests to do so. School librarian Sara Stevenson, whom we’ve fact-checked before, said in a letter to the editor in the Austin American-Statesman that about 8 a.m. March 21, 2017, she was the fifth person to submit a required paper form requesting to testify at that day’s Senate Education Committee hearing on legislation to enable public school students to attend private schools using government aid. We recently confirmed that no school voucher plan has passed into Texas law despite decades of attempts. But by the end of March 2017, Sen. Larry Taylor’s Senate Bill 3 cleared the Education Committee, which he chairs, and the Senate. Still, prospects for his proposal to launch state-funded educational savings accounts for students remained uncertain. Texas House members voted 103-44 during action on the 2018-19 state budget to bar state aid from paying for students to attend nonpublic schools. In her letter, Stevenson said that after signing up to testify, she went to work and then returned to the hearing at 2 p.m. "My name had still not been called," she wrote. "I waited six more hours until my name was finally called after 8 p.m. "Because the order is random," Stevenson wrote, "signing up to speak becomes a game of chicken or stakeout. Who can outlast whom? A random roll call suits lobbyists just fine but not your average citizen." So, did Taylor’s committee summon witnesses at random? Asked to elaborate, Stevenson said that when she returned to the hearing, others in the audience told her she had to wait to hear her name, no telling when, which led her to conclude the order was random. "There’s got to be a better way" of organizing testimony, Stevenson said by phone, "even if I’m wrong." Other witnesses comment We turned first to Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, who said by phone that committee chairs control how hearings proceed. She said too that people seeking to speak at the March 21 hearing submitted paper witness registration cards to committee staff; there was no option to sign up on an electronic kiosk. Our subsequent review of more than 120 "witness registration" cards submitted for the hearing enabled us to phone a few witnesses to elicit their experiences. Arif Panju, an Austin lawyer who testified for SB 3, told us he attended the full hearing. To him, the order of witnesses called to testify seemed fair. Similarly, Robin Lennon, a Kingwood supporter of the measure, said she didn’t see anything random in the witness order. She spoke late, Lennon said, after turning in her witness card after midday. Others echoed Stevenson’s claim. An SB 3 opponent, Ginger Russell of Magnolia, told us she was the first person to turn in a witness card that morning yet ended up speaking about 2:30 p.m. "There seemed to be no rhyme or reason" about the order of witnesses, Russell said, adding that she’s sure people who signed up to speak after she’d submitted her card were called before she had her turn. Summer Wise, an Austin mother in favor of the legislation, told us she asked a committee aide if there was a particular order to the speakers and was told not. "It appeared to be kind of random," Wise said. Proponent Russ Duerstine of San Angelo said he was called to testify after 4 p.m. after submitting his witness card before 9 a.m., which felt randomized. "I do remember feeling like I had no clue who was going to be called next," Duerstine said. Felicia Miyakawa of Round Rock told us she left the committee her written testimony against SB 3 before leaving to pick up her son that afternoon. Miyakawa said before that, the first witnesses were mostly proponents and that when she asked a committee aide if there was a way for her name to be moved up, she was told that Taylor was setting the order. Gary Bingham of Mesquite, an SB 3 opponent, told us he submitted his request to speak shortly after 8 a.m. yet didn’t get called up before having to leave for a mid-afternoon flight. "My suspicion is they stacked the deck the way the chairman wants it," Bingham said. "I can’t prove that." Senator unavailable for interview We reviewed those witness cards. Each card had a space for staff to record the time it was submitted. But no times were inked in. So we were unable to independently confirm what time Stevenson submitted her postcard-sized witness card where she wrote that she wished to testify against SB 3 on behalf of herself plus "all 5 million TX public school children." We asked Taylor, R-Friendswood, to speak to us about how he organized the witnesses, but didn’t win the opportunity. Instead, Matt Welch, an Austin consultant to Taylor, responded partly by pointing out Senate rules demonstrating there isn’t a mandate that any committee hear from witnesses in order. In the Senate’s adopted rules for the 2017 legislative session, Rule 11.18 states that a committee or subcommittee "chair shall afford reasonable opportunity to interested parties to appear and testify at the hearing." Another part says: "By majority vote, a committee may fix the order of appearance and time allotted for each witness at a public hearing." However, Welch said by email that on Taylor’s watch, the committee hasn’t voted to "fix" any order of appearance. Welch noted, too, that the panel’s rules, which he shared, "do not stipulate an order of witnesses nor is there a requirement that witnesses testify in the order of their witness card submission." The rules are indeed silent on when witnesses should be called to speak; a rule says only that the chairman may limit testimony and discussion. Out of curiosity, we also inquired into how House committees handle witnesses. By email, Jason Embry, spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, said: "The chairs of House committees have the discretion to decide the order of witnesses. Many House chairmen choose to call upon witnesses in the order in which they sign up." The SB 3 hearing, Welch told us, was largely overseen by the panel’s vice chair, Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, because Taylor was the author of the proposal under review. Welch said a few invited experts led off the hearing. They were followed, he said, by witnesses called in the order they’d signed up in panels of four consisting of pairs supporting or opposing SB 3. Welch said: "I don’t think it’s correct to say the whole hearing was randomized," in that the experts were not. "Part of it was randomized, part of it was not." Watching the hearing Seeking clues, we watched much of the Senate-posted hearing video, which showed up front Taylor announcing that each witness would have two minutes. The lead witnesses, we found, included advocates such as a former Wisconsin gubernatorial aide and delegates from the conservative Heritage Foundation and Charles Koch and Goldwater institutes. Also, all but one of eight initial witnesses backed SB 3; Donna Corbin of Lubbock, president of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, expressed opposition. And how did Corbin land that spotlight? By phone, the association’s Lonnie Hollingsworth said Corbin wasn’t an invited expert. Rather, he said, the association had alerted a committee clerk that Corbin had to catch a flight. Back to the video: In eight-plus hours of testimony after senators returned from a midday recess, people were called to testify mostly in groups of four. And by our count, before Stevenson was called to speak, followed by 25-plus others, the people who testified included 45 individuals speaking in support of Taylor’s measure, 29 opposed and a few speaking "on" his proposal. All told, according to the committee’s alphabetized list of individuals who testified, 67 witnesses ended up speaking in favor of SB 3, 40 expressed opposition and 12 testified without registering a position. In contrast, among 154 people listed as registering a position--most of whom didn't seek to testify--38 were in favor, 110 were against and six took no position, the list indicates. A little after 8 p.m., Lucio called Stevenson’s name. "She won," Taylor then said from the committee dais. Lucio: "You’ve been here all day." Stevenson: "I’ve been patient." Our ruling Stevenson wrote that witnesses who signed up to testify before a Senate panel were called randomly regardless of when each person had submitted a card requesting to speak. She has a point. We confirmed witnesses were not called in the order they signed up and whatever method was used wasn’t made clear. From the standpoint of someone spending all day expecting to testify, "random" is a fair description. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-07270	In the U.S. Constitution, "there’s a little section in there that talks about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/may/25/herman-cain/cain-mistakes-declaration-independence-language-co/	In case you had doubts, Herman Cain left no room for interpretation. He is running for president. Cain said it twice during his Saturday rally at Centennial Olympic Park announcing his run. Videos on the large television screen repeated it. And the celebration had all the fixin’s of a presidential bid. There were American flags. Red, white and blue balloons sailed into the air. A video of Cain, wearing a cowboy hat and striding past a farm, recounted his humble upbringing. There was also a requisite reference to the words of our Founding Fathers: "We don’t need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States," Cain said. "We need to reread the Constitution and enforce the Constitution." "And I know that there’s some people that are not going to do that. So, for the benefit for those that are not going to read it because they don’t want us to go by the Constitution, there’s a little section in there that talks about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. "You know, those ideals that we live by, we believe in, your parents believe in, they instilled in you. When you get to the part about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, don’t stop right there, keep reading. "’Cause that’s when it says that when any form of government becomes destructive of those ideals, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it. We’ve got some altering and some abolishing to do." Cain’s exhortation sent your PolitiFact Georgia team scrambling for a closer look at the U.S. Constitution. The bit about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness wasn’t there. We did a computer search of its text to make sure. Nada. Constitutional history scholar and University of Pennsylvania professor Richard R. Beeman came to our assistance via email. That phrase is in the second paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, which was written in 1776, 11 years before the Constitution was drafted during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Beeman agreed with Cain that we don’t need to rewrite the Constitution and it’s more important that Americans read it. "It might be a good thing if Mr. Cain would undertake that task," Beeman said. That language about abolishing government? It’s in the third paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, Beeman added. Oops. We asked Cain’s campaign to respond. A spokeswoman said he sometimes mentions the Constitution and Declaration of Independence at the same time. "Quite often, he references them together when speaking of his appreciation for the work of our Founders," she said. The language of the two documents can be easy for your average Joe to confuse. But confusing the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is no small mistake, especially for a candidate for president, said Donald E. Wilkes Jr., a University of Georgia law professor. The Declaration is a statement of beliefs. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. "No court makes a legal decision based on the Declaration of Independence," Wilkes said. With his first speech as a bona fide candidate, Cain joins a long, bipartisan line of presidential hopefuls who have succumbed to foot-in-mouth disease. They include Cain’s foe, President Barack Obama, who accidentally said there were 57 states during the 2008 campaign and U.S. Sen. John McCain, who said in an interview he was unsure how many houses he owned. Welcome to the 2012 presidential election season, folks. Cain earns a False.

pomt-03753	The city of Nelson, Ga., is "quieter than Mayberry."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/08/b-heath-mitchell/it-takes-lot-live-mayberry/	The headline says it all: "Moving to Nelson? Pack a gun." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran that front-page story this month about the small town of Nelson, Ga, located 54 miles north of Atlanta. The story chronicled how the town’s council recently passed a law requiring the head of every household to own a gun and bullets. Local leaders say the law was meant as a security measure. But it also made a strong statement about possible federal gun restrictions. In discussing the town and his support of the new law, Nelson’s police chief, B. Heath Mitchell, noted that Nelson was a place full of good, law-abiding folks. In fact, "we’re quieter than Mayberry," he said. OK, OK, the chief was using a bit of poetic license here. But since he compared his town to one of the best-known locales on the planet -- even if it is just a too-good-to-be-true TV town -- we thought we’d go ahead and give it a spin in the AJC Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact Georgia decided to "nip it, nip it in the bud" once and for all. And anyway, a fact check that requires watching episodes of "The Andy Griffith Show" is one we couldn’t pass up. Nelson has become a media magnet ever since the town passed the gun law. Requests for comment came from as far as Germany and the United Kingdom. Nationally, the story has been picked up by CNN, Fox News and the Huffington Post. Nelson’s new law is similar to a 1982 law passed in Kennesaw, Ga. Like Kennesaw, Nelson ultimately has no intention of enforcing the law, but hopes to send a message to possible criminals, council members said. "If you plan on doing us harm, we’ll be armed," said a Nelson city leader. We checked in with Chief Mitchell about crime in Nelson and its similarities to fictional Mayberry. Nelson straddles the counties of Pickens and Cherokee, and was once home to a thriving marble industry. The city has produced marble for headstones at Arlington National Cemetery, and for building the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Capitol. Mitchell describes the city as a Norman Rockwell painting with so few crimes that the crime rate is too low to calculate. "It’s quiet, just the way I like it," he said. In fact, Nelson is smaller than Mayberry. Nelson’s 2.5 square miles include a population of just 1,314 residents, according to the 2000 census. Mayberry’s population is 5,360, according to the opening scene of a sign posted at the railroad station in a Season 8 episode. The fictional Mayberry was said to be based on the actual town of Mount Airy, N.C., hometown of lead actor Andy Griffith. Griffith starred in the 1960s sitcom as the town’s sheriff, and Don Knotts played his bumbling deputy, Barney Fife. Andy didn’t carry a gun, and Barney was allowed just one bullet, which Andy made him carry in his shirt pocket as a safety precaution. In Nelson, Mitchell is the only lawman in town. When he takes a vacation, the job falls to the sheriff’s offices in Pickens and Cherokee counties. The town is budgeted for two more cops, Mitchell said, but they haven’t been hired yet. What crime Nelson does have is of the small-time variety, mainly burglaries. The last murder happened five years ago, and the suspect has fled to Mexico, according to the chief. Most of Nelson’s time is taken up with traffic control. Back in Mayberry, the crime report looks pretty similar. We watched a Season 2 episode, "Sheriff Barney," for more information. In that episode, we find out that Mayberry has held the distinction of having the lowest crime rate in the state for three years running. In that episode, the major crime is said to be a resident operating an illegal moonshine still in the mountains. Andy and Barney have been looking for the still for weeks. Eventually the moonshiner, Rafe Hollister, comes to the jail and turns himself in, saying it was only a matter of time before Andy and Barney would catch him anyway. With that kind of self-policing, who needs guns. Actual crime numbers for the two towns are hard to find. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports only provide crime statistics on cities with populations over 100,000, so Nelson is not covered in this data, and the city doesn’t seem to have reported any data. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation only provides statewide crime rates, not those for local jurisdictions. As for unofficial data, real estate website Sperling’s Best Places gives Nelson a rank of 2 on a 1-to-10, lowest-to-highest scale for property and violent crime. The U.S. average for that website ranking is 4. Two other "Andy Griffith Show" episodes mention Mayberry’s low crime. One calls Mayberry the most crime-free town in the country, but there aren’t any episodes detailing offenses. PolitiFact Georgia did some checking to see if Nelson was on any list of the safest cities in America. Golly, nothing there. Plano, Texas, listed by Forbes as having the lowest crime rate in the nation, has a violent crime rate of 0.17 per 1,000 residents. Its population is about 262,000. The north Fulton municipality of Milton, listed as the nation’s 39th safest city on one website, averages one murder a year. Towns comparing themselves to Mayberry is nothing new, said Jim Clark, head of the 20,000-member "Andy Griffith Show" Rerun Watchers Club. "People understand Mayberry as being the touchstone of wholesomeness with quiet, gentle life," Clark said. Even when the Vietnam War and racial tensions erupted in the real world, "The Andy Griffith Show" provided a place of escape with Mayberry where Opie (Andy’s TV son) was still doing kid things and Aunt Bee was making homemade apple pies. "But if you’ve got a low-crime town, you probably don’t need to arm every resident," Clark said. "It doesn’t seem like a necessary thing to do for peacekeeping purposes." So does Mitchell’s claim get renewed for another season? The Nelson police chief said his town was quieter than Mayberry. Both small towns have limited crime and a limited police presence. Nelson is such a small town that its crime statistics are not reported by the FBI or GBI; and "The Andy Griffith Show" didn’t detail crime stats. One major difference in the towns: Mayberry’s officers made a point of fighting crime with words, not guns. Andy didn’t even carry one. Nelson’s leaders opted for an entirely different style of governance by requiring each head of household to own a firearm and bullets. Many small cities with low crime, such as Nelson, liken themselves to Mayberry. But living up to the extremely high standards set by that fictitious town is almost impossible. We rated Mitchell’s claim Half True. Staff writer Eric Stirgus contributed to this article.	None	B. Heath Mitchell	None	None	None	2013-04-08T06:49:20	2013-04-02	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-04236	"Mitt Romney received exactly zero votes in at least 12 Cuyahoga County precincts."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/21/chain-email/emails-blog-posts-claim-mitt-romney-got-zero-votes/	Election night results showed Barack Obama topped Mitt Romney in Ohio by a margin of 2 percentage points, but the distribution of votes was much less even than that split. Romney won 72 of Ohio's 88 counties, including two that no Republican had won since 1972. "On a map depicting the 2012 outcome, Ohio would be a sea of red with islands of blue," The Plain Dealer reported. Obama's margin of victory was provided by Democratic strongholds like Cuyahoga County. In some areas, his tally was so lopsided that the numbers caused disbelief. Readers asked PolitiFact Ohio to check into the accuracy of chain emails and blog and Facebook postings about Romney’s performance in some Cuyahoga County precincts. "Mitt Romney received exactly zero votes in at least 12 Cuyahoga County precincts," one email said. Others made similar claims, citing 9 or 21 or some other number of precincts, depending on the source. The emails and postings variously described the numbers as "strange," "disturbing," "bizarre," "alarming" and "unprecedented," and some questioned whether the figures indicated impropriety. So just what do the election numbers show? Did Obama indeed pitch a shutout in a dozen precincts? PolitiFact Ohio started with the unofficial returns posted by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections for the county's 1,077 precincts. The table shows that Romney received no votes in 17 precincts in Cleveland. Romney also was shut out in one precinct in East Cleveland. That's 18 total precincts in Cuyahoga County where Romney received no votes. Romney got just one vote in each of 20 precincts in Cleveland, two precincts in East Cleveland and two precincts in Warrensville Heights. And he got just two votes in each of 28 other precincts in Cleveland, East Cleveland and Highland Hills. Some online postings about the election results linked to a Plain Dealer article by data analysis editor Rich Exner. Exner told us that one sentence in the article was cited in a number of postings and emails to him: "The vote, incredibly, was unanimous in Obama's favor in nine Cleveland precincts." (Because third-party candidates received votes in the eight other Cleveland precincts where Romney received none, those weren't unanimous.) Some of the blogs and emails interpreted his use of the word "incredibly" as meaning "not credible" and therefore not true. Not so, says Exner. "I used the word in the sense of 'amazingly' or 'strange but true,' as in 'Incredibly, he was still alive' -- meaning 'it's amazing' and 'he was alive,' not that it's not true. "The vote was lopsided, but it was believable." In his checks around the state, Exner found lopsided tallies for Obama in other urban areas, including precincts with no votes for Romney in Cincinnati (Hamilton County) and Dayton (Montgomery County). PolitiFact Ohio also checked the 2008 results for Cuyahoga County. We found that John McCain got no votes in 18 precincts then, or the same total that denied any votes to Romney. CBS News took note of the shutout precincts in Cuyahoga County while reporting that Romney also received no votes in 59 voting divisions in Philadelphia. "Incredulous Republicans might be tempted to indict voter fraud as a culprit," the CBS story said, but "the reality is less salacious than the conspiracy theory - a consequence of demography, not electoral shenanigans. Most big cities are heavily Democratic to begin with, and geographic patterns of racial segregation may yield an even more one-sided electoral result in certain areas than in the city as a whole." All the Cuyahoga County precincts in which Romney was shut out are in neighborhoods with heavily African-American or Latino populations. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in August underlines the significance of that demographic. It showed Obama leading by a 2-to-1 margin among Hispanic voters and had his support at 94 percent among black voters, with zero percent favoring Romney. Six percent said they were undecided or had no opinion. None of the poll's 120 black respondents picked Romney. An election day exit poll by NBC News found that black voters in Ohio picked Obama over Romney by 96 percent to 3 percent. That percentage matches the spread by which Obama won in Cleveland precincts east of the Cuyahoga River. For more perspective, PolitiFact Ohio turned to an authority on voting in Cleveland: Mark Salling, senior fellow in the Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University and director of its Northern Ohio Data & Information Service since 1981. He is also Ohio’s liaison to the Census Bureau for its redistricting data programs. Salling cited census data that showed more than 90 percent of the voting age population is black in 15 of the 17 Cleveland precincts in which Romney received no votes. The others are heavily Hispanic, and all are low-income neighborhoods "where Democrats traditionally are very, very strong," he said. "Using standard measures of probability, given the overall distribution of percentages in the county's precincts," he said, "I find that a zero percent vote for Romney, though somewhat unlikely, is also entirely feasible." Conversely, he said, those same demographics suggest it is "virtually impossible Obama would receive zero votes" in the county’s precincts. It may be surprising that no Romney votes were found in some precincts, Salling told us, "but it is a far reach to suggest fraud as the explanation." The claim that Mitt Romney received no votes in more than a dozen precincts in Cleveland may seem amazing. But voting history, registration, demographics and statistical analysis say it is both feasible and credible. The Board of Elections says it is actually understated. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates as True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-11-21T06:00:00	2012-11-11	['None']
pomt-01059	The religious liberty bill proposed in the Georgia House of Representatives does not specifically exclude corporations, which means they can legally claim a religious exemption.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/21/jeff-graham/are-corporations-able-claim-religious-exemptions-u/	As a proposed religious liberty bill begins to pick up steam in the new legislative session, so, too, does the controversy over just what the measure does. Opponents scuttled a proposal last year over concerns that it would effectively legalize discrimination against gays and other minority groups. State Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, retooled the proposal as House Bill 29 this year and said his intent is a law that prevents government from intruding on people’s faith-based beliefs. But the head of a gay advocacy group recently said the latest proposal would still allow private businesses to discriminate against customers by citing religious beliefs. "It is my certainly my understanding that if corporations are not specifically excluded under state law, then corporations could still claim a religious exemption," Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham said in an interview with WABE radio. The question gets into the details of legal minutiae, which is right up PolitiFact Georgia’s alley. So we decided to check: Does existing law require corporations to be specifically exempted for it not to apply to them? Reaching out to legal scholars from across the political spectrum, we found a rare agreement. Without that exemption, businesses can claim a religious exemption. Why? Think back to Mitt Romney being mocked for telling a heckler at the Iowa State Fair that "corporations are people, my friend." Legally, Romney is mostly right. In legal terms, corporations have had some of the same rights as you and I since the early 1800s. Those rights that allow government to regulate businesses much the same way it legislates some human actions, said Anne Tucker, a law professor at Georgia State University who specializes in business and corporate law. Corporations went on to gain the right to make political expenditures with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. Then, the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores ruling last year affirmed that some for-private businesses also have religious rights. The basis for that ruling: the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. On top of that, Georgia code also clearly defines a person as "an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a business trust, an association, a firm, or any other legal entity." Combined, that creates the opportunity for all sorts of businesses – not just the "closely held" firms listed in the Hobby Lobby ruling – to potentially discriminate based on religious claims, legal experts said. To opponents, the mere opportunity is of concern in Georgia, which like the federal government does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. "Notwithstanding the guarantees of the author, and his intentions to limit it to state action, we have some reason to be concerned, because in the past those limitations haven’t been enough to protect people from discrimination in Georgia," said Tanya Washington, a law professor at Georgia State University whose amicus brief was cited in the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Supporters of the measure, though, argue that the exemption should remain so that Georgia falls in line with existing Supreme Court rulings. "They may not like it, but the fact is, that is what the law is," said Mathew Staver, founder of the conservative Liberty Counsel and law professor at Liberty University. "I think it makes sense to have corporations, which are legal persons, have First Amendment protections for free exercise of religion just like they’ve had free speech rights in the past." That controversy has proved distracting – and fatal to other proposed religious liberty bills in Georgia and elsewhere, such as Arizona. The AJC Legislative Navigator gives this year’s bill a 13 percent chance of passing in its current state. Mark Goldfeder, a law professor at Emory University who also is the senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion, said there is an easy fix. The bill could be amended to define a person as only a "natural person or religious organization," meaning only specific organizations, churches, temples and the like. Teasley plans to do just that. He told PolitiFact Georgia that he had heard of the claim about corporations being able to claim the exemption and put the question to legislative counsel. Like the outside scholars, the attorney for the Legislature agreed the measure would extend to businesses. Teasley said he plans to add the term "natural person" to the bill in a bid to achieve his original objective: Stop government overreach on an individual’s right to religious conscience. He said he plans that change in the next week. "This should not be a controversial bill," Teasley said. "This kind of thing used to bring Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals together, and I hope it can again." That’s a fact check for a different day. But in the world of politics and religion, we have found the equivalent of a leprechaun riding a unicorn across a field of four-leaf clovers: complete consensus. The claim was whether the bill, as drafted, would allow businesses to claim religious exemptions. We rate it True. (Editor’s note: An early version of the fact-check published Jan 16 incorrectly stated that Florida is the second most populous state. It is the third.)

pomt-05238	"Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands" and "wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/04/tom-barrett/recall-challenger-tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-ha/	Picking up on chain email and internet rumblings, Democratic gubernatorial recall challenger Tom Barrett is hunting for votes in the June 5, 2012 election by aiming for Wisconsin’s 600,000 deer hunters. Here’s the pitch: "Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands," Barrett says on his campaign web site. "Don’t let Scott Walker take away your right to hunt deer on public lands!" There’s even Facebook page called "Save Wisconsin Hunting" set up that is connected to an effort by the liberal Daily Kos web site to highlight the hot-button issue. The Barrett campaign also bought a Google ad. Type "James Kroll" in the search box, and you get this message: "Scott Walker wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder" with a "Join us!" link goes to the campaign website. The target is Republican Gov. Scott Walker, but the man at the center of the issues is James Kroll, the Texas consultant hired for $125,000 by Walker to recommend improvements to the state’s deer management system. Kroll is known as "Dr. Deer" from his articles in hunting magazines and his appearances on hunting shows on TV. His recommendations are expected in late June 2012. So where does Barrett’s claim Walker wants to "privatize state lands" and "sell our deer to the highest bidder" come from? Hunting on public land has long been part of our state’s deer hunting tradition. Of the 339,261 deer killed in 2011, about 60,012 were taken on public land, according to the Department of Natural resources. The Barrett campaign did not respond to our request for their backup on the claim, but a return to Google shows an on-going back and forth between the two sides. Many of the attacks on Kroll -- and Walker -- stem from Kroll quotes in a Feburary 2002 story in the Texas Monthly. The full story is behind the magazine’s pay wall, but here’s what the most cited portion says: "Game management," says James Kroll, driving to his high-fenced, two-hundred-acre spread near Nacogdoches, "is the last bastion of communism." And it continued: "People who call for more public lands are ‘cocktail conservationists,’" he says, who are really pining for socialism. He calls national parks "wildlife ghettos" and flatly accuses the government of "gross mismanagement." But the article is 10 years old and there has been no public indication from Kroll that he advocates turning Wisconsin’s public lands into a game farm where you have to pay to hunt. Nor has there been any indication Walker supports such an approach. This was made clear in a May 26, 2012 piece by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel outdoor editor Paul Smith: "While he is a controversial figure among wildlife professionals for his extensive work in high fence deer management and captive deer breeding, at no point has Kroll advocated for privatizing deer hunting in Wisconsin." Kroll told Smith his comments were distorted by a liberal publication. But they’ve caught fire. In a chain email, those who receive it are asked to pass it along since it is sure to cause a wedge among Walker supporters. Here’s one post from the Barrett site: "Kroll has an extreme philosophy of turning public hunting grounds into profit-making entities. This would have dire consequences for average Wisconsinites, and make it far costlier to take part in this Midwestern tradition." Kroll responded with a lengthy blog post of his own: "The blog reports of what I said about ‘communism’ is a distortion of my real feelings, as well," Kroll wrote, in part. "We discussed how the top-down approach to game management was the wrong approach (sound familiar in regard to Wisconsin?), and if you give people the incentives and support to manage game animals on private and public lands, as well as a say in how these resources are managed, it is a ‘win-win’ for everyone." And he told Smith: "The last thing I want is to make it harder for hunters to participate in the great sport of deer hunting in Wisconsin on public land." We asked Walker’s office about the governor’s plans for deer hunters. "Governor Walker supports hunting on public land, always has supported hunting on public land, and will continue to in the future," Walker spokesman Cullen Werwire said in an email. "Governor Walker will not enact ‘steep fees’ to hunt on public lands. That is crazy." Our rating Barrett claimed "Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands" and "wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder." The evidence for the claim goes back to a 10-year-old article that describes Kroll’s views about hunting in his home state of Texas, not Wisconsin. His final report has not been made, there is nothing about privatization in any preliminary recommendations, and Kroll has stated clearly he does not support private management of state lands for hunters. Walker has said the same. Without any direct evidence, this claim looks like all heat and no light. Pants on Fire!	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2012-06-04T09:00:00	2012-05-31	['None']
pomt-10236	Sarah Palin "already has more executive experience" than Barack Obama and Joe Biden "combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/rudy-giuliani/executive-makes-it-right/	The experience issue came roaring back to the 2008 campaign after John McCain picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate. The Sunday after the Palin announcement, Republican Rudy Giuliani defended the choice on CBS's Face the Nation. "Maybe it's my own background as a mayor and United States attorney," Giuliani said. "But this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her. I mean, she already has more executive experience than Biden and Obama combined." Palin graduated from University of Idaho in 1987 with a major in journalism and worked as a sports reporter for about two years. She married her husband in 1988 and co-owned small businesses with him (a commercial fishing operation and a snow machine and all-terrain vehicle business). In 1992, her political career began when she won election to the Wasilla (prounounced wah-SIL-uh) city council. In 1996, she ran for mayor of Wasilla and unseated the incumbent by a vote of 617 to 413, according to press reports. Wasilla has a strong-mayor form of government. The mayor breaks ties on the city council and acts as the city administrator. When Palin took office in 1996, the pay was $68,000. In 2000, Wasilla had a population of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. It is located near the city of Anchorage. During her tenure as mayor, Palin focused on increasing funding for basic infrastructure. During her bid for re-election in 1999, the Anchorage Daily News reported that Palin "counts among her successes the recently opened Fred Meyer store, the passage of a $5.5-million road and sewer bond, and the near halving of property taxes from 2 mills to 1.2 mills, the equivalent of an $80-a-year drop in taxes on a $100,000 home." Palin also cut the budget of the city's museum, and all three of the museum's employees quit in protest. Terms limits prevented her from running for mayor again in 2002. Instead, she ran for Alaska lieutenant governor and lost. In 2003, Gov. Frank Murkowski appointed her to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, where she served about a year before leaving the commission and blowing the whistle on fellow Republicans for conflicts of interest and conducting campaign work on public time. In 2006, she ran for governor, defeating the incumbent Murkowski in a primary and then winning the general. She took office on Dec. 4, 2006, and will have held office for two years a month after Election Day. So Palin has six years of executive experience as mayor of Wasilla and two years of executive experience as governor of Alaska, for a total of eight years of executive experience. Neither Obama, Biden, nor McCain have ever held the office of governor or mayor. McCain has about 13 months executive experience in leading a Navy unit of 1,000 people when he was in the military. So Palin beats all of them. Obama has argued that running his national campaign constitutes relevant executive experience. "My understanding is that Gov. Palin's town, Wasilla, has I think 50 employees," Obama told CNN on Sept. 1, 2008. "We've got 2,500 in this campaign. I think their budget is maybe 12-million dollars a year – we have a budget of about three times that just for the month." But we think elected executive experience is what Giuliani had in mind here. And even given Obama's point, Palin's years of elected executive experience beat out the rest of both tickets, even her own running mate. So we find Giuliani's statement True.

pomt-11448	Says Jennifer Aniston said, "Me and all the Trump supporter celebrities decide to make a company named ‘celebrities for Trump’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/12/universal-news-portal/headline-jennifer-aniston-formed-celebrities-trump/	Actress Jennifer Aniston is not really forming a company to support President Donald Trump, despite a hoax you might have seen on Facebook. A March 10 headline by Universal News Portal falsely quoted Aniston as saying, "Me and all the Trump supporter celebrities decide to make a company named ‘celebrities for Trump’, which fight against all anti Trump celebrities, I think President Trump needs our support." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Aniston has formed any group for celebrities to promote Trump. The story recycles fake news from another website last year. The Universal News Portal story didn’t match the headline. Instead, the story smashed together another story about a Saturday Night Live skit poking fun of Trump and a gossip story about Aniston and a clothing collection. In December 2016, Alec Baldwin on SNL pretended to be Trump retweeting a 16-year-old named Seth. "I just retweeted the best tweet," Baldwin said, while pretending to be in the middle of a security briefing. "I mean, wow, what a great, smart tweet." In real life, Trump did retweet Seth Morton, a California teenager, who had been critical of CNN. The Universal News Story then pivots to an entirely different topic and lifts from a Gossip Cop story in 2017 about whether Aniston is launching a clothing collection with the Home Shopping Network. Aniston doesn’t appear to be particularly active in politics, though she did appear with other celebrities at a Hollywood Hills lunch fundraiser for Democrat Hillary Clinton in August 2016.

pomt-04911	John Mica "voted to borrow $10 trillion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/02/sandy-adams/sandy-adams-says-john-mica-voted-10-trillion-debt/	The federal debt is at the center of a bruising interparty war between Republican Reps. Sandy Adams and John Mica. Adams, a freshman from Orlando, is using Mica’s 20-year voting record to paint him as a Washington insider steeped in a culture of excessive spending. "Mica voted to borrow $10 trillion," an Adams mailer claims. The mailer’s flip-side contains the following text beside an overdue bill: "We got the bill for Mica’s spending spree. Over $30,000 for every man, woman and child in America." Indeed, the amount of gross debt has increased by more than $10 trillion since 1993, when Mica started his first term in the House. The debt increased from $4.17 trillion on Jan. 4, 1993 (his second day in office) to $15.87 trillion as of July 31, 2012, leaving a difference of $11.7 trillion. Another measure, using debt owed by the public, gives a difference of $8 trillion. So the number is right, but is this a fair attack? Not entirely. The debt ceiling vote is a routine but often politicized procedure in Congress, with the party in charge voting yes and the opposition voting no. Since 2001, Congress has voted 11 times to increase the cap because of "persistent budget deficits and additions to federal trust funds," according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. (You can see the increases in the debt limit since 2001 here. Click on Table 7.3) Mica has voted against some debt limit increases, particularly ones that were part of laws aimed at preventing collapse of the housing market and banks, as well as the economic stimulus. But Mica has also voted to raise the debt ceiling since taking office in 1993. Mica spokesman Alan Byrd said five favorable votes came "in time of war, after 9/11 and when he and Congress balanced the budget." Interestingly, his most recent vote -- the controversial August 2011 deal that increased the national debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion -- also snagged support from Adams. Add that to Mica’s other votes to raise the debt ceiling since 1996, and the increases total $3.95 trillion, not $10 trillion. Bruce Bartlett, an economist who blogs for the New York Times, said the bills Adams spokeswoman Lisa Boothe sent us as evidence appeared randomly selected. Bartlett previously held positions in under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. "None appear to be tax cuts. Several are debt limit increases. It is fundamentally stupid and dishonest to claim that voting for a couple of different bills were THE reason the debt increased," he said. "This claim is beyond ridiculous." We wanted to look at the bigger picture. Yes, Mica has voted to raise the debt ceiling, and the campaigns can quibble over the total amount of increases he supported. The more important thing for voters to understand is Mica, like many other members of Congress, voted for some of the policies that explain our bleak debt situation today. Some of the largest factors driving the growth of the debt over the last 10 years come down to three things: spending on the unpaid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 (and extensions of 2003 and 2010), and President Barack Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus package. In 2001, nonpartisan economists at the Congressional Budget Office expected the government would pay off its debt by 2006 and have a surplus by now. That clearly didn’t happen, so the agency evaluated in 2011 how much of the debt could be attributed to legislative and economic factors. The breakdown: $8.5 trillion driven by legislation such as the Bush tax cuts, the stimulus, and the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, for imperiled banks, and $3.2 trillion for economic reasons. Mica -- like many Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and fellow Florida Rep. C. W. Bill Young -- voted for the Bush tax cuts and the wars. The Washington Post breaks down how current members of Congress voted on these three areas in this 2011 interactive graphic. While Mica’s votes play a role, there’s blame to be shared with his colleagues. And 75 percent of all members of the current Congress voted for at least one of these drivers, according to the Post’s 2011 analysis. How much of the legislation passed within the past 10 or so years led to the debt we have now? A report from the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative determined about 68 percent of the growth in federal debt between 2001 and 2011 could be attributed to new legislation. Of that, 40 percent was the result of Bush tax cuts. The remaining 60 percent was from increased spending on the wars, the stimulus, the bank bailouts and Medicare Part D. The debt has dramatically risen since the onset of the country’s recession in 2007 and 2008, rising to about 70 percent as a share of the economy, said Jason Peuquet, research director at Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "Legislation contributes to that, but also a big, huge part is the strength of the economy," Peuquet said, "and for that it’s much harder to assign credit or blame." One humongous challenge not being addressed in campaign materials is how to reduce the debt before it spins out of control, Peuquet said. It won’t take long (think 2020s) for that to happen, he said, if this path continues. "By that measure, no lawmaker has been successful, because we haven’t enacted debt reduction legislation that puts us on a successful path," he said. Our ruling Adams said Mica "voted to borrow $10 trillion." What she meant, her spokeswoman says, is the debt has increased by $10 trillion since he took office, an increase made possible by his sporadic votes to allow growth of the debt ceiling. We found his votes on the debt ceiling don't really tell the whole story. More importantly, we think, is the fact that he voted for some of the policies that caused the need for debt ceiling votes in the first place. Still, it takes more than one member of Congress to drive the debt up by the trillions. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Sandy Adams	None	None	None	2012-08-02T15:18:03	2012-08-02	['John_Mica']
pomt-02685	"Under the Espionage Act, (Edward Snowden would not be) allowed to come into court and say ‘I was justified in disclosing this information.’ There is no whistleblower exception in the Espionage Act."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/07/glenn-greenwald/greenwald-nsa-leaker-snowden-has-no-whistleblower-/	Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the reach of American intelligence into the private lives of its citizens, is approaching a legal turning point. He is at the midpoint in his one-year asylum granted by Russia. What lies beyond is uncharted territory. The New York Times editorial board said the government should grant Snowden clemency and a plea arrangement that contains a limited punishment. Others, including White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice, have said Snowden should return without conditions and "have his day in court." In the view of Glenn Greenwald, the investigative journalist who was one of the first to gain access to Snowden’s stolen documents, a fair trial is the last thing that awaits the whistleblower if he comes back without a deal. "Under the Espionage Act, you're not allowed to come into court and say ‘I was justified in disclosing this information’," Greenwald said on CNN’s The Lead. "There is no whistleblower exception in the Espionage Act." Greenwald’s debate with Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post made for good television. But we wanted to dig deeper into Greenwald’s point about Snowden. There are two pieces to this puzzle. What does the law say and could Snowden reasonably expect to tell his side of the story in a trial? Limited protections for the intelligence community The Espionage Act of 1917 makes it a crime punishable by death or imprisonment to share "information relating to the national defense" with anyone who might want to do harm to the United States. Snowden faces two counts of unauthorized communication under that law. The Espionage Act contains no explicit whistleblower protection, said Bob Turner, a national security expert at the University of Virginia who has been critical of Greenwald and thinks Snowden should face the death penalty. However, Turned noted that while the 1917 law is silent, a law passed in 1998, the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, does provide government workers with options. Under that law, Snowden could have raised his concerns with the Inspector General’s Office at the NSA or spoken to congressional intelligence committees. A separate federal law protects whistleblowers more generally but that only applies to sharing unclassified information, not the secret materials that Snowden had in hand. "Had Mr. Snowden taken his information to the House or Senate intelligence committees, that would clearly not have violated the Espionage Act," Turner said. "And if it did, his conduct would have been protected by the more recent 1998 whistleblower statute." But others familiar with this legal landscape told us that no matter what, Snowden was still vulnerable. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, for instance, does not prohibit agencies from retaliating against employees, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. Goitein said President Barack Obama helped matters slightly when he issued a presidential order preventing retaliation against federal employees. But that order did not explicitly address the rights of contractors such as Snowden. And Goitein added, neither that directive nor the whistleblower law "bars the government from criminally prosecuting whistleblowers." In 2010, NSA staffer Thomas Drake tried to use proper channels to report allegations of improper contracting but wound up the target of an investigation, said Kathleen McClellan, the national security and human rights counsel for the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy group. "Drake followed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower law to a ‘T’," McClellan said. "He went to the Department of Defense inspector general and both congressional intelligence committees and it did not protect him from retaliation. In fact, it made him the target of an investigation." Federal agents wrongly went after Drake in pursuit of a separate matter and charged him with multiple felonies, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. When it became clear that whatever Drake had shared with the press was either not classified or already in the public domain, the government’s felony case collapsed. A federal judge said it was "unconscionable" that Drake and his family had endured "four years of hell." Restrictions within the courtroom Greenwald said Snowden would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. On this front, we can’t offer a definitive assessment. We don’t know what matters government prosecutors would permit into the courtroom, and we don’t know how a judge would rule on the government’s motions. However, recent trials under the Espionage Act make it clear that Snowden could expect no guarantee that he would be able to tell a jury why his violations might serve the country’s national interests. What he and his lawyers could present might be tightly constrained. "The executive branch has asserted the sole authority to determine what remains a secret," McClellan said. "The way these Espionage Act prosecutions have gone, it has not been fair to the defendants. It has not followed what you would expect in a traditional trial." Turner of the University of Virginia said he thinks public sympathy for Snowden is so broad, he might do fine with a jury. "All he needs to walk free is a single juror who views him as a ‘hero’," Turner said. But whether any juror would hear a single reference to Snowden’s claims to a higher purpose is also unclear. In 2012, a federal judge ruled that former CIA worker John Kiriakou could not present evidence about his reasons for going public with accounts of U.S. waterboarding during interrogations. Kiriakou was charged with disclosing classified information under the Espionage Act. "Any claim that he acted with a salutary motive, or that he acted without a subversive motive, when he allegedly communicated NDI (national defense information) to journalists is not relevant to this case," the judge wrote. The trial of leaker Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning -- who gave troves of classified information to WikiLeaks -- followed similar lines, with the important difference that those proceedings took place in a military courtroom. Our ruling Greenwald said that if Snowden returned to the United States, he would have no protections under the Espionage Act and would not be allowed to justify his actions in court. In terms of the law, Greenwald is literally correct. Two other legal documents, however, could have provided Snowden some potential protections before he shared classified information with the press. But once he did, no law offers Snowden any shelter. Greenwald’s further claim on what Snowden could say in his defense is less clear because it depends on what government prosecutors would do. We can’t assess the accuracy of any statement about future outcomes. However, it is clear that there is ample precedent to show that Snowden would have no guaranteed opportunity to explain his motivations. Folding in that ambiguity, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01517	"To deprive" underprivileged children "of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/sep/21/todd-staples/todd-staples-airs-smoky-claim-about-children-not-g/	Todd Staples, the Texas state agriculture commissioner, recently described a veggie-based dietary awareness campaign in the schools as an activist movement that degrades children’s nutrition to push an agenda. Meatless Monday is pretty self-explanatory; it’s an awareness campaign that encourages people to abstain once weekly from eating meat. The program was born in 2003 as a health initiative out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with stated goals of improving people’s health and lowering fuel and water costs of food production by encouraging lower meat consumption. It has since spread to participants that include hundreds of schools, universities and restaurants in 24 countries. But the arrival of the Baltimore-based program at three elementary schools in the Dripping Springs Independent School District made Staples "very concerned," he said in a Sept. 8, 2014, commentary in the Austin American-Statesman. For Staples, excluding meat is not just a matter of taste – it’s a blow to daily nutrition, especially if students are not well nourished at home. "It is important to remember that for many underprivileged children the meals they eat at school often represent their best meals of the day. To deprive them of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day," Staples wrote. Was Staples right about kids getting shorted? Let’s look at the meals that drew his ire, then explore if affected children are not getting needed proteins. Warning: Flames ahead. Dining options on a Meatless Monday Generally in Dripping Springs, lunching students may select up to one meat/meat alternate, three fruit or vegetable dishes and one grain or milk dish. If a child forgoes a meat/meat alternate, he or she is allowed four fruit or vegetable dishes. A student must take a minimum of three dishes with at least one serving of fruit or vegetable. On any day, of course, there's a chance a child won't choose to eat any protein dishes. The lunch menu at Dripping Springs Elementary, which participates in Meatless Mondays, runs on a three-week cycle. On the first Monday, when meat is not an option, the school offers vegetarian chili with cornbread, grilled cheese sandwiches, assorted vegetarian soups, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, "healthy" refried beans, crunchy vegetable dippers and chilled pears or fresh fruit. On the second Monday of the school’s cycle, the menu includes cheese ravioli, vegetarian chili, cornbread, mozzarella sticks with marinara, a baked potato with fixings, spinach salad, green beans, apple sauce and fresh fruit. On the third Monday, the cafeteria offers black bean burritos, bean and cheese burritos, vegetarian chili, corn bread, cheese nachos, a baked potato with fixings, "healthy" refried beans, "carrot babies" with ranch, chilled sliced peaches and fresh fruit. This is a Meatless Monday menu from Dripping Springs Elementary, as presented online by the school. Staples’ backup information By email, Staples spokesman Bryan Black pointed out the website of First Lady Michelle Obama’s school nutrition program, Let’s Move, hosted by the federal government and affiliated with the White House, which says: "Many children consume at least half of their meals at school, and for many children, food served at school may be the only food they regularly eat." We heard from Black before Staples announced he plans to resign to become president of the Texas Oil and Gas Association. Black said the website "is dedicated to healthy lifestyles for children and confirms the message from Commissioner Staples" that many students might not have access to protein at home. John Crowley, head of the Dripping Springs Independent School District’s nutrition program, said 14.03 percent of students in the Dripping Springs Independent School District receive free or reduced-price school meals. Children from families with incomes at 185 percent of the poverty line and less qualify for reduced-price school meals under federal guidelines. Non-meat proteins Another federal publication, Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010, accessed at health.gov, describes the vitality of protein to a balanced diet. It also lists protein-rich foods that go beyond meat. Those include milk and milk products such as cheese, as well as beans, peas, nuts, seeds and soy products. We sent an inquiry on the quality and quantity of proteins in non-meat foods to the Nutrition and Food Science Department at Texas A&M University, and our questions were referred to Dr. Peter Murano, who worked for several years as deputy administrator at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service. "It is certainly the case that meat foods, as well as dairy foods and eggs, are widely known to be the best sources of high quality, complete protein – which means that all of the essential amino acids that a child needs will be present, and in a highly digestible/utilizable form," he said in an email. "It is however recognized that by pairing incomplete protein plant-based foods, such as beans and rice, that each complements the other, and the combination is also a good source of protein," he said. Murano said some common pairings of incomplete proteins to make complete proteins include beans and rice, peanut butter and bread (wheat) and corn and lima beans. A complete protein includes all nine essential amino acids that the body uses to build flesh as well as hormones and enzymes. With incomplete protein sources, like unpaired beans, the body will not be able to make new material like hormones and flesh. However, Murano said that even on a vegetarian diet, one could have a healthy protein diet by consuming a complete protein or accurately paired incomplete proteins "several times a week." An online search led us via HealthProfs.com, a directory of health professionals, to Stephanie Turkel, a registered dietitian nutritionist with a private practice in Plano. She said by phone that substituting meat with even an incomplete protein, like nuts or beans, once a week is "just fine." Turkel said: "You don’t have to get everything you need in one day. It’s over the course of a week that you should see if you’ve gotten everything you need." Federal standards for nutritious meals Crowley said the Dripping Springs cafeterias are required to follow the federal Department of Agriculture’s Guidelines for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, which require meals be "nutritionally balanced," according to the agency’s Food and Nutrition Service website. Daily, schools must offer at least one meat or "meat alternate" option, the guidelines say. According to the Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, "offering a meat/meat alternate daily as part of the school lunch supplies protein, B vitamins, vitamin E, iron, zinc and magnesium to the diet of children, and also teaches them to recognize the components of a balanced meal. Menu planners are encouraged to offer a variety of protein foods (e.g., lean or extra lean meats, seafood, and poultry; beans and peas; fat-free and low-fat milk products; and unsalted nuts and seeds) to meet the meat/meat alternate requirement." The guidelines also say: "USDA wishes to clarify that schools have the option to offer mature beans and dry peas (e.g., kidney beans, pinto beans, black beans, garbanzo beans/ chickpeas, black-eyed peas, split peas and lentils) as meat alternates. Mature beans and peas dry longer on the plant, fix more nitrogen, and have a higher protein content, which makes them nutritionally comparable to protein foods." As we looked into Staples’ claim, the online Culturemap Dallas reported the Texas Department of Agriculture had removed guidelines for healthy children’s meals from an agency website after Staples objected to the meatless lunches. The guidelines, published by Square Meals, the agency’s school nutrition education and outreach program, advise that children "substitute beans for meat once a week." Culturemap Dallas quoted Black saying the document was taken offline because it "offered advice that was neither complete nor scientifically based and does not reflect the position of the agency." Our ruling Staples wrote: "To deprive" underprivileged children "of a meat-based protein during school lunch is most likely depriving them of their only source of protein for the day." He offered no full-fledged backup for this claim while the Austin-area school he singled out as demonstrating this shortcoming follows a menu written to satisfy federal requirements schools serve a protein meeting dietary needs, whether it’s meat or not, every day.

pomt-14116	Under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County "$31 million to fix a single ditch."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/may/09/david-jolly/epa-regulation-will-force-31-million-upgrade-pinel/	A voter at an Orlando debate asked U.S. Reps. David Jolly and Alan Grayson whether climate change presented the greatest threat the world currently faces. That’s when Jolly steered the conversation into a ditch. The Indian Shores Republican answered that "agents of terror" are the greatest threat against America, but the effects of climate change are real and will need to be addressed. He said he preferred tax credits and federal money for research instead of stricter environmental and energy regulations from Washington. "What won't work is the president's Waters of the United States regulation that's going to cost Pinellas County, just one county, between $400 million and $2.5 billion," Jolly said on April 25, 2016. "It will cost them $31 million to fix a single ditch." We wanted to know if there was a new regulation forcing Pinellas County to spend $31 million to fix a ditch. What we found out is that the price is an old estimate, and there's little consensus how the Environmental Protection Agency is actually changing the rules. Ditch debate Jolly’s campaign said his example came from a letter the business lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida sent to members of Congress on Aug. 12, 2014. The letter asked the state’s congressional delegation to support changes AIF wanted for a new rule concerning the Clean Water Act. Before we get swept up in regulatory minutiae: The original Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 after pollution issues and disasters like Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio of 1969 and Lake Thonotosassa fish kills in Florida. The legislation was supposed to regulate discharges into waterways and wetlands, but environmentalists and industry groups have long debated which bodies of water the act encompassed. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 raised questions about the law’s reach, so the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers aimed to clarify what waters were federally protected, or "waters of the United States" (known as WOTUS, really). The agencies published a proposed rule change on April 21, 2014, that addressed several issues, including whether the law applied to ditches and in which circumstances. That did anything but dry up debate. Groups like the National Association of Counties and Republican attorneys general from several states flooded the EPA with objections to the rule. (Florida later joined the call for courts to review the rule.) We’re sticking to ditches for this fact-check. Opponents were concerned that if the rule reclassified a ditch as a water of the United States, county governments could be on the hook for upgrading them to meet EPA rules. In its letter to Congress, AIF said upgrades would be costly. AIF’s initial assessment was based on a "preliminary analysis" commissioned by the Florida Stormwater Association, a group of the state’s stormwater management officials. The analysis looked at eight waterways and the estimated cost to bring them in line with the new regulation. Among the eight examples was "Pinellas Park Ditch #5," a 1.3-mile-long flood control canal known as Bonn Creek that empties into the Joe’s Creek Watershed. The ditch, with mostly concrete banks, was designed to handle stormwater runoff. The analysis said the ditch wasn’t currently under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, but it would be under the proposed rule change. The report estimated it would cost $31.3 million to make the ditch compliant with the Clean Water Act’s accepted phosphorous and nitrogen discharge levels. Whether any upgrades to that ditch would be that expensive — or even necessary — is still up in the air. Jon Devine, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the analysis Jolly cited doesn’t say why it would cost $31.3 million, and is out of date as a talking point. "It’s based on the proposed rule, not the final rule, and the final rule took account of a lot of input — including that of municipal stormwater dischargers," Devine said. Critics did manage to alter the current of the discussion. After the rule was announced in April 2014, the public was invited to comment. Their concerns about ditches led to changes in the final rule, which was announced in May 2015, and published in June. Among the revisions was that "the rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation." The short version: If a ditch that handles stormwater wasn’t under federal jurisdiction before, it wouldn’t be under the new rule. When we contacted AIF for comment on the revised rule, the group said they were not currently working on the issue and had nothing to add. "The bottom line is that the final Clean Water Rule does not change, in any manner, the way stormwater systems have always been covered under the CWA and, therefore, does not result in any new costs for CWA compliance," EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones told us in an email. If the EPA doesn't require a status change, that would leave the ditch in local control. Devine noted that the EPA usually allows state agencies to decide most of their own policies. "The states establish what criteria apply to particular waterways, based on their state-designated uses," he said. "Though this is subject to EPA oversight, in my experience (the) EPA is extremely deferential to state judgments." But EPA reassurances haven’t settled these turbulent waters. Kelli Hammer Levy, chairwoman of the Florida Stormwater Association’s legislative committee and a section manager for Pinellas County watershed management, disagreed with the EPA’s assertion. She said the rule’s reach was not yet fully known, and provisions in it would change the ditch’s status. "Bonn Creek would be classified as a tributary in this case because it has a bed, bank and high water mark and discharges into a (water of the United States)," Levy said in an email. Pinellas County isn’t alone in not accepting what the EPA says. Many state officials across the country still didn’t trust the parameters of the final rule, which was set to go into effect in August 2015. It has been put on hold nationally because of pending litigation from more than a dozen states. Our ruling Jolly said that under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County "$31 million to fix a single ditch." His figure comes from a 2014 report that claimed it would cost the county that much to make a stormwater ditch in Pinellas Park compliant with Clean Water Act pollution guidelines under a new rule. But the report didn’t specify why it would cost so much, and didn’t reflect changes the EPA made to the rule in 2015. Jolly didn’t make up the $31 million estimate, but his wording makes it sound as if the EPA is definitely forcing crippling regulatory costs on the county. The agency denies the rule change affects how ditches are classified, but the scope of the new rule is still far from settled. Debate abounds about how specific waterways would be affected by the final rule, which currently is under a court stay pending litigation. There’s no irrefutable evidence of an imminent (and expensive) federal takeover of the ditch in question. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa52d834-16ed-4684-b426-bc07f5e3e85a	None	David Jolly	None	None	None	2016-05-09T16:52:25	2016-04-25	['None']
pomt-06189	"Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/12/george-allen/allen-says-us-lent-2-billion-brazil-oil-and-gas-ex/	U.S. Senate candidate George Allen wants to drill here and now. The Republican has repeatedly reminded voters that the U.S. has the largest fossil fuel reserves in the world and faulted President Barack Obama for not aggressively developing them. Allen brought up the issue again in a Dec. 7 debate against Democrat Tim Kaine, who is also pursuing the U.S. Senate seat in 2012 that will be vacated by Jim Webb, D-Va. Allen voiced frustration with the Obama administration’s refusal to allow oil and natural gas leases off Virginia’s coast. "Our federal government has lent $2 billion to the state-owned oil company of Brazil to allow them to explore for oil and gas, and that shows how contradictory our energy policies are," Allen said. Is the U.S. really financing $2 billion worth of off-shore energy production in Brazil? To back the claim, the Allen campaign emailed postings from several websites, including Forbes Magazine. Our research, however, shows that some of the information in the articles was loosely interpreted by Allen, and some of the information was inaccurate. All of the articles center on a tentative offer by the Export-Import Bank of the United States in April 2009 to provide up to $2 billion in financing to Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company. The Export-Import Bank is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them purchase U.S. goods and services. The bank, as noted in a September story by PolitiFact’s national staff, receives its spending authority from Congress but gets no appropriated funds. It operates using revenues from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers, although its transactions are ultimately backed by the U.S. government’s faith and credit. The bank is allowed to have up to $100 billion in outstanding loans. We called Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman, Phil Cogan, and asked him to assess Allen’s statement. "It is not correct," he said. Ex-Im’s tentative agreement was an "expression of the bank’s willingness" to consider up to $2 billion in loan applications from Petrobras to finance its purchase of U.S. goods and supplies. All five of the bank’s board of directors who approved the decision were appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican. On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan to Petrobras made by JPMorgan Chase. The loan guarantee is helping Petrobras purchase goods and services from about 150 U.S. companies, according to Cogan. There were no other financial transactions between Ex-Im and Petrobras before their preliminary loan agreement expired in April 2011. Cogan said it has not been renewed. So Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras, let alone the $2 billion Allen claimed. All it did was back a $308 million loan that a private bank made to the Brazilian oil company. Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the Allen campaign, told us George Allen should not be faulted for making a mistake about Ex-Im and Petrobras. He said George Allen based his statement on information published by credible news sources. "We just didn’t come up with the stuff and throw it against the wall," Dan Allen said. "We relied on something published on Forbes magazine’s website." He referred us to a May 2011 posting headlined "Petrobras to Tap Ex-Im Loan `Soon.’" The Forbes article, however, appears to be referring to the closing of JPMorgan Chase’s loan to Petrobras that Ex-Im guaranteed. Dan Allen also sent us an article that ran this August in The Hill, a publication that covers Congress. That story, however, never said a $2 billion loan had been made. It merely noted that "Republicans railed against a 2009 proposed $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Import-Export Bank to the Brazilian oil company Petrobras." Different claims about about the loan have been circulated over the last two years by conservative voices such as The Wall Street Journal editorial page, Fox News and Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas. Seeking to counter misinformation, Ex-Im has posted a website fact sheet about its relationship with Petrobras. The bank takes exception to statements by Allen and others that the dealings reflect inconsistent federal policies on off-shore drilling. "There is no connection between the federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales by other countries," the fact sheet says. "In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors." Our conclusion: Allen says the U.S. government lent $2 billion to Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil. He is referring to a preliminary agreement by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an independent federal agency, to consider offering up to $2 billion in financing to help Petrobras buy American goods and services. In 2010, Ex-Im agreed to guarantee a $308 million private loan made to Petrobras by JPMorgan Chase. There were no other transactions, and Ex-Im’s agreement with Petrobras expired this April. The bottom line is that that Ex-Im did not directly lend any money to Petrobras. We rate Allen’s statement False.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-12-12T07:00:00	2011-12-07	['Brazil']
pomt-07692	Says "union bosses" bused protesters to a Central Florida education protest.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/mar/07/florida-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-protesters-bused-central-florida-educ/	Government union bosses are busing in protesters to picket state elected leaders. In Florida. And it's happening right now, says the Florida Chamber of Commerce. "We've see the images on television: government unions from around America staging protests in Wisconsin," chamber president Mark Wilson says in a radio ad that began airing March 3, 2011. "They're not fighting for ordinary citizens, but grappling for power and money. Unfortunately, Florida is next on the union bosses' hit list. They're busing protesters to Central Florida right now to harass your courageous representatives." Are union mercenaries already targeting Florida as the next Wisconsin by busing protesters to staged events? PolitiFact Florida wanted to find out. The chamber ad, which is airing on Central Florida radio markets, is a response to staged rallies outside the district offices of three Seminole County state legislators -- Scott Plakon, Chris Dorworth and Jason Brodeur. Chamber spokeswoman Edie Ousley said the ad actually began airing four hours prior to the 4 p.m. March 3 rallies, and was based on reports about the event-planning that the chamber had acquired. Ousley wouldn't detail those reports, but she said the protests were organized through large union e-mail lists that included affiliations with groups like MoveOn.org, and members of the former ACORN community organizing group. "Providing transportation is classic government-union strategy 101," Ousley said. We first looked at media reports from the events. The Orlando Sentinel covered the events and wrote about it under the headline "Seminole teachers picket lawmakers over merit pay, pensions." Sentinel writer Dave Weber described the protest at Plakon's Longwood office, saying that about 60 teachers and supporters protested plans to tie teacher pay raises to student test score results and a plan to make teachers take a de facto pay cut by forcing them to contribute to their retirement. Weber never mentioned busing and quoted only a local teacher, Melissa Cole. Here's what Weber told us via e-mail: "I was at one of the three protest sites in Seminole, by a strip mall in a busy suburban roadway area just off I-4 in Longwood. There were no buses around and I did not perceive anyone had been bused in. I recognized many of the teachers. Had no sense that anyone was there who did not belong. Those I interviewed by random selection all were local teachers." The Sanford Herald covered the protest of Brodeur's office in Sanford. Writer Gary Roberts described the crowd as being more than 60 teachers and support staff and said that "mourners" dressed in black and carried R.I.P. signs. They were "decrying proposed cuts in the education budget and collective-bargaining rights, along with a merit-pay system that would develop teacher-performance evaluations that are at least 50 percent based on student-learning growth," Roberts wrote. Roberts quoted local special education teacher Katie Murphy as saying: "We want to make sure the teacher's voice is heard. Strong schools must have strong teachers, and we need to have a strong voice." Again, no mention of buses. Roberts told us in an interview on March 7 that there were no buses. "They were teachers," Roberts said. "They were not professional demonstrators." We were unable to find news coverage of the protest of Dorworth's office in Heathrow. Katie Betta, a spokeswoman in the House speaker's office, said Dorworth received around 50 notecards from protesters urging him to not attack teachers. Protesters mostly filled out the cards anonymously, she said. The rally was organized by Gay Parker of the Seminole Education Association, so we asked her whether people were bused as part of the protest. "That's just a lie," Parker said. "There's no other way to describe it. The chamber was trying to create a scene that was non-existent." Parker said the protesters were made up of teachers, education officials and parents of students. The closest thing to a bus was a person in a wheelchair who needed to take a special van to reach the protest. Here's the write-up of the event provided by the Seminole Education Association. A total of about 300 people participated, the teacher association estimated. Parker provided PolitiFact Florida with what she said was the original e-mail announcing the protests. Parker said the e-mail was sent to a list-serve made up of members of the Seminole Education Association. The e-mail asks protesters to call a number to RSVP and to identify which rally they would be attending. The e-mail also asks people to show up 10 minutes before the protest was set to begin to organize the crowds. The e-mail, if accurate, makes no mention of busing or offers buses to attend the protests, nor does it reference MoveOn.org or ACORN. (MoveOn.org is promoting a series of rallies in more than two dozen Florida cities being organized for March 8 by a group of progressives, Democrats and union sympathizers. But those rallies, part of something called Awake the State, were created independently of the Seminole County teacher protest ) Lastly, we talked to Plakon, the lone legislator at his office during the protest. Plakon said he spent more than an hour with the protesters. He didn't notice any buses, and said most of the people he talked to seemed to be local teachers, though he didn't ask everyone where they were from. "I think most of them came from our area, but I didn't specifically ask them," Plakon said. Plakon told us he heard the chamber radio ad. He said that as early as the morning of the protest, he had no idea if 10 people would be showing up at his office, or 500. "I would have believed either of those numbers," he said. Ousley, with the chamber, offered no evidence that anyone was bused in. She said that it's possible the chamber's ad -- which started airing before the 4 p.m. rallies started -- might have stopped the busing from happening. "It's highly possible (the ad) diffused protesters from arriving via organized transportation like buses," she said. Even if that's true, it still makes the ad wrong. A quick note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have looked into the protesters gathered in Wisconsin as well. You can read their work here. The Florida Chamber of Commerce said government unions bused protesters to a series of Central Florida rallies on March 3. They didn't. This claim is not only wrong, based on the evidence, but it plays on stereotypes of government unions to try to demonize union workers (in this case, teachers).

pomt-02791	The minimum wage "in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-higher-now-under-ha/	One of the major messages in President Barack Obama’s Dec. 4, 2013, speech on the economy was that Americans deserve a raise. "It's well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office," Obama said in an address at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. We have previously checked an Obama claim that the minimum wage is "lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office." We rated that Mostly True. But we hadn’t heard the claim about Truman, so we decided to take a look. The minimum wage, as written into law, has been $7.25 an hour since 2009. Here’s a table that covers the years of Truman’s tenure in office. We calculated the inflation-adjusted wage using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator. Year Nominal minimum wage Real minimum wage (2013 dollars) 1945 0.40 5.19 1946 0.40 4.79 1947 0.40 4.19 1948 0.40 3.88 1949 0.40 3.93 1950 0.75 7.27 1951 0.75 6.74 1952 0.75 6.61 2013 7.25 7.25 So in 1950 -- which was during Truman’s time in office -- the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was $7.27, which is higher than today’s minimum wage. Two cents more isn’t a lot, but it’s enough to give some credibility to the president’s claim. We should add, however, that 1950 was the exception. That was the year the minimum wage was raised -- indeed, it was nearly doubled. And with each subsequent year, inflation ate away at the wage’s purchasing power. Ultimately, during seven out of the eight calendar years when Truman was in office, the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was lower than it is today -- not higher. Does that matter? It’s a judgment call. "The point wasn’t to isolate the eight years of Truman presidency, but the fact that we’re back at the same level as it was in 1950," said Bobby Whithorne, a White House spokesman. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, agreed. "A lawyer defending the president’s wording would add that the president did not say the current minimum wage is lower than it was in every single year of President Truman’s tenure in office," Burtless said. "Some of President Obama’s listeners would no doubt be stunned to (learn) that the purchasing power of the current minimum wage is below its purchasing power in any year of the Truman administration, even if the difference is only two cents per hour." Our ruling Obama said the minimum wage "in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office." That’s correct for 1950, but incorrect for the other seven calendar years of Truman’s tenure. In fact, you could just as easily say that the minimum wage is higher today than it was under Truman, and that would be correct for seven out of the eight years he was in office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-01945	Says Central Texas river water sent to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years’ worth of Austin’s water use.	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/24/austin-water-utility/water-sent-past-austin-downstream-farmers-2011-amo/	Austin-area residents worried about drought might rue an agency’s 2011 decision to let thousands of gallons of water from the Highland Lakes flow past the capital to downstream farmers, the head of the Austin Water Utility said. A May 27, 2014, news story said: "Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either." The story--by StateImpact Texas, a collaboration of KUT Austin and KUHF Houston--then quoted Greg Meszaros, the utility’s director, as saying: "Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use" was sent to rice farmers that year. That much? Asked the basis of Meszaro’s comparison, utility spokesman Daryl Slusher referred to annual reports on water use from the Lower Colorado River Authority, which oversees water releases from the chain of man-made lakes along the Colorado River running through Austin: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin. By email, Slusher said the reports show that in 2011, the latest year the authority sent water downstream to rice farmers, the provided water was three times the amount of water used by Austin in 2011, 2012 or 2013. According to the authority’s March 30, 2012, report on water use in 2011, the authority that year released 529,580 acre-feet in water for downstream agricultural purposes, including rice farming. That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says. An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is roughly equal to the water used by three average Austin households in a year. And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority. This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years. Another way to suss Meszaro’s claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years’ worth of Austin’s water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011. Our ruling Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austin’s water use. Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it. We rate this claim as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-04840	Says Ronda Storms voted to fund the 'Taj Mahal' courthouse.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/13/rob-turner/sen-ronda-storms-voted-courthouse-known-taj-mahal-/	"Ronda Storms is NO Fiscal Conservative," claims a simple flier pushed by Storms’ opponent in the Republican primary for Hillsborough County property appraiser. The mailer from incumbent Rob Turner highlights property tax increases over Storms’ six-year tenure as a county commissioner as well as a notorious courthouse project that occurred during her time in the state Senate. "As a Senator she voted to fund the "Taj Mahal’ Courthouse. … We Can’t Afford Any More Storms." Ah, the Taj. The not-too-distant origins of Florida’s finest courthouse serve as a cautionary tale about last-minute lawmaking and unscrutinized government spending. Is it fair to say Storms voted to fund the new courthouse of the 1st District Court of Appeal? Let’s dive in. In her 2010 investigative story about the facility, Tampa Bay Times senior correspondent Lucy Morgan characterized the courthouse as "a $48 million behemoth in which each judge will get a 60-inch LCD flat screen television in chambers (trimmed in mahogany), a private bathroom (featuring granite countertops) and a kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator)." In a year of layoffs and cutbacks across the state, these touches of elegance were not appreciated. So how did the project eke past officials and watchdogs (press corps included)? Morgan compiled a detailed timeline stretching from a May 2004 meeting of the 1st DCA judges, in which they said they had outgrown their 23-year-old building, to December 2010, when the fresh, controversial structure was ready for move-in. A key moment in the story happened on the last day of the 2007 legislative session, a typically hectic time ripe for last-minute, undetected budget maneuvering. Tampa Sen. Victor Crist introduced an amendment to a 142-page transportation bill that contained a bond issue for $33.5 million for the courthouse’s construction. No senators asked about the bond issue, and it passed on a voice vote. The bill itself, HB 985, passed by a vote of 37-2. Storms, like most everyone, voted yes. It passed the House, then led by Marco Rubio, and was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist. Storms, interviewed by PolitiFact Florida, said she thought she was voting to refurbish a dilapidated courthouse. "It certainly wasn’t to build mahogany," she said. "Anybody who was voting at that time was not voting for the ‘Taj Mahal.’ What we were voting to do was taking care of the 1st DCA." Storms and Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, became two of the project’s most vocal critics in the months following the Times story. At one point in a committee hearing, Storms quipped, "We should insist on our pound of flesh and make them put the air at 80 in the summer and at 50 in the winter." As an aside, Storms said she probably voted against Crist’s amendment, which contained the bonding language, on an unrecorded voice vote out of a personal philosophy to protest unvetted, "vendor-driven" language affixed to bills in session’s closing days. (There is no record of voice votes, so we can't tell how Storms voted.) Fasano told us Turner’s attack is "just not honest" despite Storms' technical support of the transportation bill. "You might as well blame every legislator that voted for it," he said, which would total 105 members. That’s the point, says Warren Weathers, who works for Turner. He recalled Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, saying legislators share blame with the judges who pushed for the fine finishes. "We didn’t say she built it," Weathers said. Crist (of no relation to Florida’s former governor) defended Storms in an interview. "Ronda approving the budget for the court system and the construction budget for a new courthouse has nothing to do with the court’s design, engineering and building," he said. "It would be like saying her approval of the DMV budget holds her accountable for somebody’s else driving record." Crist’s position is understandable. He says groups aligned with the tea party are using the "Taj Mahal" -- a moniker he hates -- against him in his re-election campaign for Hillsborough County Commission. Our ruling Turner says in a mailer that Storms "voted to fund the ‘Taj Mahal’ Courthouse." She indeed cast a vote for a transportation bill that included funding for the courthouse, that much is true. But there is some additional information we find missing from this attack. Namely, the courthouse money was inserted at the last minute into a larger bill without much explanation. The money, as far as most lawmakers knew, was to build a courthouse, not an opulent one. Once details of the ‘Taj’ became known, Storms openly criticized the plan. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rob Turner	None	None	None	2012-08-13T18:25:24	2012-08-13	['None']
pomt-03898	Says "Studies show the average age of entry into prostitution is 12 to 14 years old."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/02/diane-mckeel/Is-average-age-entry-sex-trafficking-between-12-an/	Statistics about sex trafficking, especially about minors, are notoriously difficult to document. For example, this newspaper once tried to show whether Portland is the child sex trafficking hub thatelected officials and national media say it is, only to find that nobody really knew. PolitiFact Oregon likes statistics and we like to know where they come from, especially when politicians use those statistics to shape public policy. Which is how we’ve come to Multnomah County Commissioner Diane McKeel, an east county resident who has made combating human trafficking, especially child sex trafficking, a priority. McKeel told columnist Elizabeth Hovde, who writes for The Oregonian’s editorial page, that the average age of entry into the sex trade industry is 12 to 14. It’s not the first time McKeel has cited the statistic. In a 2010 guest column about at-risk girls, she also wrote that "studies show the average age of entry into prostitution is 12 to 14 years old." A statistical average between 12 and 14? Wouldn’t that mean a large number under 12? Also, was she talking about the average age of entry for all trafficked prostitutes, including adults? Or just juveniles? She clarified in an interview that, "the issue for me is the commercial exploitation of children. The average age of entry is 12 to 14. This is about our children being bought and sold on the street." The analysis The commissioner’s office provided us with numerous links. Many of the sources go back to a 2001 University of Pennsylvaniastudy. It’s big and fat and the number in question is on page 92, under the section "ages of first intercourse and entry into juvenile prostitution." The age range of entry for boys "was somewhat younger than that of the girls, i.e. 11-13 years vs. 12-14 years, respectively." We emailed Dr. Richard Estes, the lead author, to learn more about sample size and methodology. His response was not illuminating. "Any numbers you come across, even mine, represent best estimates of the situation. Because of the secretive and hidden nature of the problem it simply is not possible to get an accurate ‘head count.’" Another widely cited report comes from a Vancouver, Wash., based group called Shared Hope International. The2009 reportstates that "research has shown that the average age of entry into prostitution and pornography is 12 to 14 years old in the United States." There’s no research citation, but there is a pie chart breaking down age of entry into prostitution, based on a Clark County, Nevada, survey of girls arrested for prostitution-related offenses. The 96 girls were ages 11 to 17. We did the math, and the average we got was 14.96, almost 15 years old. That’s young, but not 12 or 13. Our email requesting clarification got no response from Shared Hope. We were stumped. We scoured the Internet for more sources, reading abstracts and tracking down anyone who might have a clue. A criminology professor we queried wrote back saying that "good estimates are hard to find, and good data are harder yet" and wished us luck. He directed us to yet another paper, which we read, diligently. We queried the U.S. Department of Justice. McKeel’s office provided links to testimony and a report tied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which state the average ages as 11 to 14, or 12. But a spokeswoman at the Bureau of Justice Statisticssaid those are not bureau numbers and that the bureau has no average age for entry into sex trafficking. "The likelihood that it comes from a nationally representative study is very low," wrote Kara McCarthy in an email. Eventually, we spoke with David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, and a respected researcher in the area. He, too, had nothing concrete but offered skepticism. The average age is higher if adults are included. Older teens simply may escape survey. "There isn’t a lot of good research on this; they’re relatively small samples," he said. But he did suggest another academic article, which led us to Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a professor at the School of Social Work at Arizona State University. Is the average age of entry into prostitution and sex trafficking between 12 to 14 years old? "That is statistically impossible," the professor said. "If she were to say, minor trafficking often starts between the ages of 12 and 14 across the country, that is somewhat supported." Roe-Sepowitz said the statistic as it applies to girls is used by many, if not all, advocacy groups; the studies on which those statistics are based date back to the 1980s. Indeed, after we spoke with her, we found a 1985 study that reports the average age as 14. Finally, we called Multnomah County Deputy Sheriff Keith Bickford. He manages the Human Trafficking Task Force. Was he aware of an average age? Short answer: No. "You’ll hear 12, you’ll hear 14. I have yet to nail down an actual average from the people I talk to," he said, adding that he is reading more accounts involving younger children.. The ruling We’ve galloped across the country and found that definitions are fuzzy, statistics are murky and nobody knows for sure. We’ve learned that many organizations continue to repeat the statistic that the average age of entry into juvenile prostitution is between 12 and 14 years, despite the research being old and limited. We found a professor who said there is some research backs up the claim, and another expert who warned that sample sizes are inadequate and research limited. One of the most widely cited sources told us that any numbers, even his, are estimates. We conclude McKeel’s statement is partially accurate -- there are some studies -- but missing important detail. The studies speak only to juveniles, and the studies themselves are speculative. There is no nationally representative, comprehensive sample. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07982	The nation's food supply is "99.99 percent safe."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/19/jack-kingston/georgia-congressman-says-food-supply-extremely-saf/	Congress has passed major legislation aimed at making food safer, but that doesn't mean it will pay for it. Widely considered to be the first major overhaul of the agency's food safety provisions since 1938, the Food Safety Modernization Act tightens safety rules and boosts Food and Drug Administration inspections at an estimated price of $1.4 billion over the next five years. That's way too high a price, some say. The nation's food is just fine to eat, said Republican U.S. House Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah. "We still have a food supply that's 99.99 percent safe," Kingston told The Washington Post. "No one wants anybody to get sick, and we should always strive to make sure food is safe. But the case for a $1.4 billion expenditure isn't there." Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford repeated the claim in a Jan. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The food supply is 99.99 percent safe? That sounds great, but is it true? Kingston has a big say in whether food safety legislation gets funded. He is chairman of the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that holds the FDA's purse strings. "I would not identify it [funding] as something that will necessarily be zeroed out, but it is quite possible it will be scaled back if it is significant overreach," Kingston told The Post. Crawford told us this is how Kingston and his staff determined the food supply is almost completely safe: They took the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's latest estimate for the number of food-borne illnesses each year and divided it by the number of times people in the U.S. eat each year. The CDC said that in 2011, just under 48 million people will contract a food-borne illness. There are about 310 million people in the U.S. If they eat three times a day, that's 339.45 billion meals. And 48 million is roughly 0.01 percent of that. So Kingston's math is accurate. But does that mean his overall point is correct? We found Kingston was comparing apples to oranges. He used CDC data that measured a person's risk of getting ill to measure the risk of the food safety supply. But those are not the same thing. The CDC's figure came out as part of an announcement that one out of six people in the U.S. will contract a food-borne illness in the coming year. In other words, about 16.66 percent of the population will have problems this year ranging from a bad stomachache to deadly kidney failure because of dangerous pathogens in their food. We talked to Elaine Scallan, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Public Health who formerly worked for the CDC. She did research on which the CDC results are based. Kingston's calculation measured the risk that your next meal will make you sick. But it is "definitely not a good indicator of the safety of our food supply," Scallan said. Each time you eat a meal, you take that same risk again. Over time, that risk adds up, Scallan said. Robert Scharff, a professor at Ohio State University and a former economist with the Food and Drug Administration, calculated that food-borne illness costs the U.S. $152 billion annually. His report described food-borne illness as "a large problem that deserves the attention of policymakers." He also noted in an e-mail interview with AJC PolitiFact Georgia that Kingston's approach only covered the risk of eating a single meal. Other criticism was more blunt. Barbara Kowalcyk, director of food safety for the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention, expressed similar concerns and said Kingston's measure "just doesn't make sense." New York University professor Marion Nestle, a well-regarded food safety and nutrition expert, had similar concerns. "Isn’t 48 million people getting sick or dying unnecessarily worth doing something about? I think so," Nestle said. So experts think Kingston's method has a crucial, if not fatal, flaw. But we decided to dig deeper. We looked at a sampling of food safety tests to see whether their results resembled Kingston's. A recently completed nationwide survey on young chickens by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service found some 7.5 percent tested positive for salmonella and 46.7 percent for campylobacter, which the CDC describes as "one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States." The federal government also looked at fruits and vegetables at processing plants in 2008 and found that while 5 percent had e. coli bacterial levels that suggested they came into contact with unclean water, only 0.3 percent of samples tested positive for the form that can make you sick. It reported 16 of nearly 11,700 samples tested positive for salmonella. Consumer Reports magazine tested for salmonella and campylobacter in chicken it bought from grocery stores. Its results, published in the January 2010 issue, were that campylobacter was present in 62 percent and salmonella was in 14 percent. Both were present in 9 percent. The magazine's publisher, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumers Union, backed the food safety bill. To sum up: Kingston's calculation mixed up its apples and oranges. He said his calculation showed that the food supply is "99.99 percent safe." But his numbers described something very different: the risk that your next meal will make you sick. The problem is that you have to eat far more than your next meal to survive. And with each meal, your risk increases. Your risk of getting sick is actually much greater -- predictions say one in six people will get sick in 2011 from food-borne illness. In other words, while Kingston's math is correct, his results didn't say what he claimed they did. Studies that do measure the safety of certain foods contradict him. Since his statement has an element of truth but ignores crucial facts, his statement meets our definition of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2011-01-19T06:00:00	2010-12-25	['None']
pomt-14024	"I wanted to keep it private, because I don't think it's anybody's business if I want to send money to the vets."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-wanted-keep-veterans-fundrais/	Donald Trump lashed out at reporters during a press conference in which he announced the names of veterans groups that he and his supporters had donated to. Trump had made a pledge to give money after backing out of debate in a Iowa and scheduling a rival fundraising event instead. Trump scheduled the May 31 press conference after journalists, led by the Washington Post’s David Farenthold, asked questions about how much of the $6 million from the Iowa event had actually reached veterans charities over the next few months. At the press conference, Trump announced donations to more than three dozen groups totaling $5.6 million -- less than the promised $6 million, but close. (Here are the groups’ ratings from Charity Navigator, an independent organization that rates charities on efficiency and transparency.) But Trump also took the opportunity to slam journalists for asking about his follow-through with veterans groups. "I wanted to keep it private, because I don't think it's anybody's business if I want to send money to the vets," Trump said. He then went on to talk about how much money he had raised, adding, "I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job." Anonymous charity has long been considered one of the most honorable types of charitable giving, but Trump has not practiced that in this case. While Trump could have kept quiet about his fundraising, he didn’t. Here are five examples in which Trump or his campaign touted their plans to hold the veterans fundraiser opposite the Jan. 28 Fox News debate in Iowa. • Press conference in Marshalltown, Iowa, Jan. 26. Trump told reporters, "Probably I won't be doing the debate. I'm going to have something else in Iowa, do something where we raise money for the veterans and the wounded warriors. We're going to do something simultaneously with the debate." • Statement by the Trump campaign, tweeted out by Trump, Jan. 26. It said in part, "He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again." • Tweet, Jan. 28. "It is my great honor to support our Veterans with you! You can join me now. Thank you! #Trump4Vets http://www.DonaldTrumpForVets.com" • Tweet, Jan. 28. "An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans! We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked! #GOPDebate" • Statement by the Trump campaign after the event. The campaign cited 22 groups that would receive donations from the fundraiser. All of those groups are also on the list that Trump released May 31. Each of these statements touting Trump’s efforts to raise money for the campaign occurred months before the start of the media scrutiny he would come to criticize as too invasive of his privacy. We also found these photographs of Trump handing an oversized check to representatives of two veterans groups in Iowa on Jan. 30 and Jan. 31. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump distributes a check to Puppy Jake during a campaign event at the Adler Theater in Davenport, Iowa. (AP) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, left, presents a check to members of Support Siouxland Soldiers during a campaign event at the Orpheum Theatre in Sioux City, Iowa. (AP) The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said. "I wanted to keep it private, because I don't think it's anybody's business if I want to send money to the vets." Trump certainly didn’t keep quiet about his intention to raise money for veterans causes when he was setting up his event in Iowa in January. To the contrary, he talked about it in media availabilities and tweeted about it on more than one occasion. His statement is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7f25381c-c3a7-4eb5-b7d4-c70b7c309889	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-31T17:41:12	2016-05-31	['None']
pomt-08922	Jim Marshall "votes liberal in Washington ... and we aren't fooled."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/27/austin-scott/congressman-votes-liberal-opponent-says/	Austin Scott has issued some fightin' words to his opponent, U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.), in the race for Georgia's 8th Congressional District. Scott, a Republican, told supporters in an e-mail that Marshall "votes liberal ... and we aren't fooled." "It's one of the worst things you can say about a candidate in Georgia," said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. Particularly in the central part of the state, where Marshall has won races by razor-thin margins. In 2006, for example, Marshall won by 1 percent of all ballots cast. Bullock expects another close race this year that could help shape the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans in Congress. "It should be our most interesting race in Georgia," Bullock said. The 8th District runs along a stretch of I-75 in Middle Georgia that includes Macon, Warner Robins, Dublin and Tifton. Republicans want this seat. Badly. In 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney came to Georgia to help raise money for Marshall's opponent, Calder Clay. Two years later, President George W. Bush made a campaign stop in the area to aid Marshall's opponent, Mac Collins. It's often one of the most contested congressional seats in the nation. Marshall, first voted into office in 2002, has been able to hold on to the seat with a coalition of moderate white voters and strong support among black voters, who make up about 30 percent of the district's registered voters, Bullock said. Republicans are eager to take control of Congress, believing they can seize upon voter anger about the economy, immigration and health care legislation. Marshall, a four-term congressman, voted against the federal health care legislation earlier this year. He supported giving the Bush administration authority to invade Iraq. Marshall describes himself on his congressional Web site as one of the "few centrists in Congress." Scott told PolitiFact Georgia he's right in calling out Marshall's voting record. Scott said Marshall "repeatedly voted for San Francisco liberal" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and voted for bailouts for Wall Street. "In Middle Georgia, that's what we call liberal," Scott said in an e-mail. Marshall voted in October 2008 for the $700 billion financial bailout plan, but he voted against a bailout plan for the auto industry in December 2008 and a $410 billion spending plan in February. The House of Representatives elected Pelosi its speaker at the beginning of 2007 and 2009 in what are largely procedural votes along party lines. Marshall voted for Pelosi, along with fellow Democrats, said his spokesman, Douglas Moore. So does Marshall vote liberal? "Only if you are looking at it from the far right," Bullock said. In 2009, Marshall was the 250th-most-liberal member out of the 431 House of Representatives members rated by the National Journal, which compiles an annual ranking of Congress. The rankings are based on House members' voting histories. He was the fifth-most-conservative House Democrat last year, the Journal concluded. In 2008, Marshall was the 234th-most-liberal member of the 428 House members it rated that year, the Journal found. He was the second-most-conservative Democrat that year, the Journal concluded. In 2007, Marshall was rated by the National Journal as the most conservative voting Democrat in the House. Marshall voted with Democratic colleagues about 89 percent of the time during the current Congress, according to a Washington Post analysis. That is slightly below the 92.3 percent average of most Democrats, according to the Post. Using his voting record, the Web site On the Issues rated Marshall as a "conservative-leaning populist." Two groups well-regarded by conservatives, the National Rifle Association and the Family Research Council, gave Marshall high marks based on his voting record. Some left-leaning groups have also given Marshall high marks for his positions on issues important to them. The NAACP last year gave Marshall an 80 rating on a scale of 100, according to Project Vote Smart. The AFL-CIO gave him a 71 score on a scale of 100, Project Vote Smart said. "[Marshall] has one of the most conservative Democratic voting records in Congress," Bullock said. "But most Republicans are further right. Would Austin Scott be more conservative than Jim Marshall? Absolutely!" Tom Crawford, who has covered Georgia politics for more than three decades, disagreed. Crawford said on his Georgia Report blog that Marshall is "more conservative than Scott on some issues." Bullock believes the key for Scott will be whether he can convince voters the Marshall is a liberal. The professor remembers when Republicans labeled Democrat Zell Miller, a former U.S. senator and Georgia governor, a liberal. Miller, you may remember, endorsed George W. Bush for president in 2004 and gave the keynote address at that year's Republican National Convention. So back to the question as to whether Marshall votes liberal? Marshall is largely rated in the middle by most political observers, based on his voting record. Some conservatives believe he's too far to the left. So where does that leave Marshall? We believe in the middle. The independent research shows Marshall votes more "conservative" than nearly every Democrat but more "liberal" than nearly every Republican. Therefore, we rate Scott's claim about Marshall as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Austin Scott	None	None	None	2010-07-27T06:00:00	2010-07-21	['None']
pomt-04500	Says Paul Ryan’s budget would turn Medicare into a "voucher."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/05/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-says-paul-ryans-budget-woul/	U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez yesterday attacked a Medicare reform proposal from Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan by claiming it would turn the health care program into a voucher system. The Democratic senator made that criticism during a debate last night against his Republican challenger Joe Kyrillos, a state senator representing Monmouth County. "But listen what I don’t want to do is what my opponent says, he basically embraces the Ryan budget. But what does the Ryan budget do?" Menendez said. "It ends Medicare as we know (it), makes it a voucher, privatizes Social Security, dramatically cuts assistance to education in our country." For this fact-check, we’re focusing on Menendez’s claim that the Ryan budget would turn Medicare into a "voucher." We issued a Mostly True ruling on a similar claim in September from state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula, and PolitiFact National issued the same ruling on a related statement by President Barack Obama in August. Just as in those two cases, Menendez’s claim is mostly accurate. Ryan has proposed providing "premium support" payments to future Medicare beneficiaries to purchase health insurance. There are some distinctions between the two terms, but the word "voucher" generally describes this approach. The plan would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries and individuals who become eligible before 2023. Those individuals could remain in the current Medicare program. But starting in 2023, newly eligible beneficiaries would receive a premium support payment to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The payments would either pay for or offset the cost of health care premiums. The latest version of Ryan’s plan was approved in March by the GOP-controlled House as part of a budget resolution, but it was later rejected by the Democrat-led Senate. It’s true that Ryan’s most recent plan more closely reflects a pure premium support, but substantively, it’s somewhere between the two approaches. As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, there are distinctions between the two terms, dealing with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Our ruling In a debate Thursday against Kyrillos, Menendez claimed Ryan’s budget would turn Medicare into a "voucher." It’s accurate that Ryan’s plan, starting in 2023, would provide premium support payments for new beneficiaries to purchase private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The term "voucher" generally describes this approach. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07159	Says Gov. Chris Christie's decision to close the Elizabeth MVC "saved no money."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/14/joseph-cryan/assembly-majority-leader-joseph-cryan-says-closing/	When the state or local government wants to save money, they often do it by shutting offices. That’s what the state did in late 2010 to MVC offices in Elizabeth, Wyckoff and Bridgeton, projecting to save more than $1 million. But a trio of lawmakers are crying foul about closing the Elizabeth office, citing lack of savings and inconveniencing residents. As a result, State Sen. Raymond Lesniak, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Cryan and Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (all D-Union) said they will introduce budget resolutions to reopen the Elizabeth office, which is in their district. The three legislators are all up for re-election this year and faced primary challenges June 7. "The Governor's decision to close the Elizabeth MVC was clearly a political one," Cryan said in a May 14 news release. "It saved no money and created unnecessary inconvenience for our residents." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether it saved no money. A letter dated Jan. 24 to Assembly State Government Committee Chairwoman Linda Stender from MVC Legislative Liaison Jonathan Pushman, and copied to the Assembly Democratic and Republican offices, states that closing the three agencies "will indeed enable the State to achieve significant cost savings. The elimination of the agency positions will allow the MVC to realize nearly $1 million in budgetary savings. With respect to the Elizabeth agency specifically, the MVC will save an additional $288,000 by closing that office." MVC Chairman Ray Martinez testified May 23 before Stender’s committee and said the Elizabeth closure saved $288,552 in four areas, according to Elyse Coffey, deputy director of communications for the MVC: rent, $70,000; parking, $13,260; security, $112,000; and overhead, $75,676 (office equipment and supplies, janitorial services, maintenance and repairs, snow removal, etc.) "These are tangible, annual savings," Coffey said. Cryan disputed the savings even before Martinez appeared before Stender’s committee. "I disagree with the 288K ($288,000) in savings that the MVC has projected from closing the location," Cryan said in a statement emailed May 20 to PolitiFact New Jersey. "According to the MVC, the rent per annum for the location was 80K ($80,000). No additional savings have been highlighted. This projected amount will surely be offset by the increased volume and demand now placed upon the Rahway and Springfield locations. Not to mention the countless inconveniences being met by the residents of Union County as a result of this decision." Prior to Martinez’s testimony, the MVC could not provide a specific breakdown of savings for the Elizabeth office since its closure on Dec. 31 and referred PolitiFact New Jersey to the Pushman letter. Looking for an independent source to confirm the MVC’s numbers, we then checked with the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. Frank W. Haines III, assistant Legislative Budget and Finance officer, referred us to the office’s analysis of Christie’s Fiscal Year 2011-2012 budget. While the analysis didn’t break down specific savings from each of the closed MVC offices, it identified savings -- provided by the MVC -- from the combined closure of the offices in Elizabeth, Bridgeton and Wyckoff. In a March analysis report that includes a list of budget questions to agencies including the MVC, the Office of Legislative Services asked the MVC: "Have these closings resulted in any cost saving so far, and if so are these savings in line with expectations?" The MVC responded: "MVC has realized cost savings in FY11 (Fiscal Year 2011) from the closure of five leased agencies Wyckoff, Bridgeton Elizabeth, Randolph and Morristown. Morristown and Randolph were leased properties MVC terminated in December, 2010 when the new facility was completed in Randolph on State-owned property. This resulted in a savings of $402,000. Wyckoff was a leased property in which MVC were served an eviction notice. Our Oakland office was expanded and those expenditures were taken into consideration when estimating a savings. The closings of Wyckoff along with Elizabeth and Bridgeton produced an overall savings of $1.6M. ($1.6 million) These savings came from a reduction of 43 FTEs, (full-time employees) rent and security." PolitiFact New Jersey caught the discrepancy in estimated savings -- $1.6 million reported to the Office of Legislative Services, $1.3 million cited to us in a May 18 email -- and asked Coffey about it. "Many of the numbers that are being tossed around are from various budget documents and budget figures often change, either up or down, as time progresses," she said in an email May 24. Despite three PolitiFact New Jersey requests to the MVC and Office of Legislative Services for the actual amount saved from when the Elizabeth office closed to present, no one has been able to provide that figure. In fact, Haines, of the Office of Legislative Services, said the number would have to come from the MVC, and the answer the MVC provided in the budget analysis "is the closest" we’re likely to get. Cryan, Lesniak and Quijano aren’t just challenging the true bottom line, however. "Since the closure of the Elizabeth MVC office, thousands of residents have been forced to travel to Springfield and Rahway and wait many hours to acquire MVC services," Lesniak said in the news release. "Elizabeth is the fourth largest city in New Jersey. It's unconscionable that it has been stripped of its only MVC office and its residents denied basic services." The release also states that forcing residents to go to the Springfield and Rahway MVC offices "has led to three- to four-hour waiting times with residents often having to go back numerous times to get their paperwork processed." Returning to Cryan’s comment about a lack of savings, let’s review. Cryan said "no money" has been saved. While there is some question about the actual amount, the correspondence indicates there's no question that there have been substantial savings from the reductions in rent and the elimination of 43 jobs.

pomt-02041	Eric Cantor "voted to fully fund Obamacare in October."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/02/dave-brat/dave-brat-says-eric-cantor-voted-fully-fund-obamac/	Republican congressional candidate Dave Brat says Rep. Eric Cantor is soft on Obamacare. The two are squaring off in a June 10th GOP primary for the 7th District congressional seat Cantor has held since 2001. Cantor has repeatedly called Brat a liberal. Brat fired the l-word back at his opponent in a radio ad this month. "He voted to fully fund Obamacare in October," a woman in the ad says of Cantor. Another woman says, "and he has the nerve to call Dave Brat a liberal? Seems to me he ought to be looking at his own voting record." The Obamacare charge caught our attention because, as House majority leader, Cantor has been at the center of dozens of Republican attempts to repeal or gut the Affordable Care Act. So we took a look at Brat’s claim Cantor voted to fully fund the law. Zachary Werrell, Brat’s campaign manager, said the statement was based on Cantor’s vote for a continuing appropriations bill that was enacted last October. The legislation ended a 16-day federal government shutdown that was caused by partisan warfare over Obamacare. The battle began as Congress faced an Oct. 1 deadline for passing an appropriations bill. House Republicans, including Cantor, initially insisted the bill strip all funding for Obamacare, then fell back to demanding delays in implementing the ACA in exchange for funding essential government programs. The White House and the Democrat-led Senate refused. The standoff ended on Oct. 16, less than two days before the federal government was scheduled to reach its debt limit and would be unable to borrow money to meet its obligations. Congress passed a measure allowing all federal programs, including Obamacare, to be funded for three months and raising the debt ceiling. The bill passed the House by a vote of 285-144. Cantor was one of 87 Republicans who backed it. Does that mean Cantor’s support for the appropriations bill was a vote to "fully fund Obamacare"? Budget analysts we spoke with were critical of Brat’s claim. Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that "in the narrowest sense" the appropriations act that Cantor backed funded federal programs that included Obamacare. "But obviously that did not mean either an endorsement of Obamacare or funding for more than a finite period," Ornstein emailed. "And since it was part of a measure to reopen the government, it meant funding a host of things that might be anathema not just to Eric Cantor, but to most other members, D and R." Maya MacGuineas, the president of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Brat’s statement ignores a key detail: the vast amount funding for Obamacare was not subject to the stopgap funding measure Cantor backed. Most of the ACA, in fact, is not even incorporated in annual appropriations bills. That’s because Obamacare largely falls under the mandatory spending portion of the federal budget which consumes about two-thirds of outlays. That category consists of entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- in which levels of funding are required under law to provide mandated services. It’s a debated question whether Congress can alter these programs through budget bills or is required to change the actual laws that established them. The remaining third of the federal budget consists of discretionary programs that were deeply affected by the shutdown and subject to annual congressional appropriations. These programs include defense, education, justice and transportation. Josh Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates balanced budgets, estimated that at least 90 percent of the health care law’s funding comes from mandatory funds that continued flowing during the government shutdown. That’s consistent with findings from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO in 2011 estimated the ACA would require about $600 billion in mandatory spending from 2012-2021. Discretionary spending for the act was pegged at $110 to $120 billion during that span. The CBO noted that most of those discretionary funds involved spending for programs that existed prior to Obamacare, such as Indian health services and grants to health centers. So the vast amount of money for Obamacare continued to flow during the government shutdown. MacGuineas said the key vote for fully funding Obamacare occurred several years earlier when Congress passed legislation establishing the ACA as "a new mandatory spending program." The House was controlled by Democrats in March 2010 when it narrowly approved Obamacare. Cantor and his fellow Republicans unanimously voted against the bill. Since then, the House has had 52 roll call votes on measures that would either repeal, defund or otherwise limit the ACA. Cantor voted for every one and sponsored two of the repeal bills. Brat on his website charges that Cantor as the House majority leader has scheduled "meaningless procedural votes so that House members could pretend to be on the record opposing Obamacare." Our ruling Brat’s says Cantor voted to "fully fund Obamacare" last October. He’s referring to a temporary appropriations bill that Cantor supported and Congress passed to end a 16-day government shutdown. The measure guaranteed continued funding for discretionary programs that rely on annual congressional appropriations, including defense and education. But Obamacare was only marginally affected by the shutdown and the bill Cantor backed. That’s because only about 10 percent of its costs are subject to appropriations by Congress. The bill Cantor supported to end the shutdown, among many other things, topped off the ACA’s funding tank. What Brat omits is that 90 percent of Obamacare remained funded throughout the shutdown and was unaffected by the bill Cantor backed. The legislation that mandated funding for the bulk of Obamacare was approved by the House in March 2010; Cantor voted against it and has repeatedly tried to repeal the measure. So Brat’s statement has an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04032	Says since Australia passed tough gun laws, "homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/31/stephen-king/stephen-king-says-australia-cracked-down-guns-homi/	Author Stephen King once asked his publisher to pull one of his novels off the shelves. Six people had died — in real life. Four boys in 10 years brought guns to school. One killed a teacher and two students. Another shot five members of a prayer group, killing three. All four teenagers had read Rage, a book King wrote when he was a teen himself and published under another name. King, in a blunt, impassioned essay, wrote that when he learned of the copycat crimes, he wanted the book off the market. He argues the United States should do the same for assault weapons. "You don’t leave a can of gasoline where a boy with firebug tendencies can lay hands on it," he said in the 25-page piece, published Jan. 25, 2013, for Amazon Kindle readers. King, a Democrat who says he owns three handguns and supports the Second Amendment, argues stricter gun control "would save thousands of lives." (His earnings from the sale of the essay will go the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.) He says Australia shows it’s possible. In 1996, 28-year-old Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people near the Port Arthur historic site, a popular tourist destination. After the shootings, the country banned and bought up automatic and semi-automatic long guns, destroying at least 600,000 in 12 months — ultimately about a third of its privately owned guns. It worked, King argues. "Since the (Martin) Bryant killings and the resulting tough gun laws, homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent in Australia. The guns-for-everyone advocates hate that statistic, and dispute it, but as Bill Clinton likes to say, it's not opinion. It's arithmetic, honey." He likes talking to "honey." He also drops a few F-bombs. We wanted to know: Have homicides by firearm in Australia dropped almost 60 percent? And did those "tough gun laws" do it? ‘It’s arithmetic, honey’ We asked King and Australian and American experts in gun violence for evidence. By a few different measures, the arithmetic works. Homicides by firearm did decline after 1996 — in fact, had already been in decline. One path to "almost 60 percent" comes from statistics compiled in part by Philip Alpers, a public health professor at the University of Sydney. The number of gun homicides fell from 69 in 1996 (excluding the 35 victims of the mass shooting prompting the laws) to 30 in 2012. That’s a decrease of 56.5 percent. (And, yes, you read those numbers right — we didn’t miss any zeros. The United States has about the same number of gun homicides every day as happened in Australia last year.) Then there’s King’s source, an item from Slate.com, he told us. It was a blog post citing a blog post citing a study — a reputable peer-reviewed piece in the American Law and Economics Review. The researchers, Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, found that in the decade after the gun laws, firearm homicides dropped 59 percent. So, on the numbers, King has strong support. But did the 1996 laws drive the numbers? That’s more vexing. "He could be right. Or he could be wrong," said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center who wrote a helpful 2011 summary of the evidence. " … The true answer is, we really don't know." Leigh and Neill designed their study to test for the law’s effect. They asked whether death rates dropped more in states that destroyed relatively more banned weapons through gun buybacks. They found the buyback program drove down firearm suicides by almost 80 percent, with no significant change in suicides that didn’t use guns. But the effect on homicides, while of "similar magnitude," was less precise, they wrote — perhaps between 35 and 50 percent. Two other studies, which Hemenway described as flawed, found the laws made little difference. But their design made it nearly impossible to find an effect, he argues. The first, authored by members of the Australian gun lobby, highlighted the fact that before the law passed, the firearm homicide rate was already dropping. If it had continued on that track, they found, that would explain the entire change — showing the law made no difference. The authors cherry-picked a high year for homicides to start their analysis, then assumed deaths would drop at the same linear rate forever — with negative deaths by 2015. The second study was more sophisticated. Authors searched for a shift in deaths in a single year that might be attributed to the law, and found their tests suggested the law didn’t "have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates." Hemenway answers that the buyback occurred over two calendar years, in 1996 and 1997 — and the two-year drop was substantial. Gun homicides fell 46 percent. Australian experts told us the science leans King’s way. But it’s not yet definitive. "The truth is that gun homicide did decline substantially after the toughening of Australia's gun laws and the massive gun buyback," said Don Weatherburn, director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. "The complication is that gun homicide was coming down before any of this. The academic debate is about whether the downward trend accelerated." His own view? That there’s some evidence that tougher gun laws reduced the homicide rate, but it is "far from conclusive." Paul Mazerolle, director of the Violence Research and Prevention Program at Griffith University in Brisbane, echoed that "more definitive work is required." Some feel more certain the laws did their job. Simon Chapman, a professor of public health at the University of Sydney, co-authored a 2006 study showing faster falls in firearm deaths after the laws. "Six years on, there still has not been a massacre," he told PolitiFact. But an even messier question is whether similar laws would work in the United States. Australia doesn’t have domestic gun manufacturers — and has the benefit of being, you know, an island. Guns destroyed aren’t so easily replaced. Our ruling King, urging his readers to support an American assault weapons ban, said that since Australia passed tough gun laws, "homicides by firearm have declined almost 60 percent." The raw numbers back him up — but cause and effect are much peskier questions. Scholars we spoke with say the evidence leans King’s way, but is less than conclusive. That’s an important clarification. We rate King’s claim Mostly True.	None	Stephen King	None	None	None	2013-01-31T14:23:24	2013-01-25	['Australia']
pomt-03225	Marijuana is "less toxic" than alcohol.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/19/marijuana-policy-project/pro-pot-group-claims-marijuana-less-toxic-alcohol/	Just as fans were filing into the Brickyard 400 NASCAR race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a big television screen by the entrance displayed a pro-pot ad with the headline "A new beer?" The ad, which opens with smiling young adults hoisting their brew mugs, drew outrage from lots of sources, including the St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation. The TV screen company, Grazie Media, pulled the ad after a few hours. The ad said: "If you’re an adult who enjoys a good beer, there’s a similar product you might want to know about, one without all the calories and serious health problems. Less toxic so it doesn’t cause hangovers or overdose deaths. And it’s not linked to violence or reckless behavior. Marijuana. Less harmful than alcohol and time to treat it that way." In this fact-check, we decided to focus on the idea that marijuana is "less toxic" than alcohol. "I don’t see how this could be a more open-and-shut case," Mason Tvert, communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which produced the ad, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "If you consume too much alcohol in a sitting or over the course of your life, you can die. If you consume too much (marijuana) in a sitting or over the course of your life, you do not die. What more could be needed to prove marijuana is ‘less toxic’ than alcohol?" Yet, as a rebuttal, some health professionals say it’s a matter of picking your poison. "It’s like trying to compare different weapons. Both have the potential to cause harm," said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine, at University of Florida. "I don’t know that there’s a clear answer." For starters, the term toxic can be vague. Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, medical director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, said toxic can be "anything that causes harm. It is possible to drink enough water to poison yourself. It’s more related to the dose than anything else." The Marijuana Policy Project’s claim that marijuana is "less toxic" rankles some health professionals and anti-drug organizations who criticize the inference that using the drug is okay. Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation, said she wants the public to realize that "these are two drugs that are both addictive and impairing and they both create unsafe situations." Briefly, here’s a look at how the National Institute on Drug Abuse describes each drug. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars and starches and while it may start as a stimulant in small doses, NIDA describes it as a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream. Intoxication can impair brain function and motor skills and heavy use can increase risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver disease. Marijuana is a dry, shredded green and brown mix of leaves, flowers, stems and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. When marijuana is smoked, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to the brain and other organs. Activists on both sides of the marijuana issue can find studies that back up their claims about the health impact of smoking weed. NIDA states in an email that the effect of marijuana can depend on the person (their biology) who’s using it, the amount and under what circumstances. "Claiming that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol cannot be substantiated since each possess their own unique set of risks and consequences for a given individual," according to an agency email statement. Statistics certainly paint a grim picture of the lethal impact of alcohol abuse. The Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 41,682 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010, the last year with the most exact statistics. That breaks down to 15,990 deaths attributed to alcoholic liver disease and 25,692 other alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides. The center doesn’t have any reports of marijuana listed as a cause of death. In 2006, there were more than 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive drinking, the CDC reports on its website. "Alcohol in excess is probably the No. 1 cause of toxicities from drugs of abuse in the world simply because it’s most widely used," Lewis-Younger said. Robert Gable wrote in an American Scientist article in 2006 that "simply tallying the number of people who die or who show up at emergency rooms is, by itself, meaningless," because that figure is influenced by the number of people using the substance. Yet the Marijuana Policy Project’s Tvert said Gable’s eight-year study on recreational drugs bolsters their assertion. Gable, a retired professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University in California, compared the toxicity of 20 abused substances using reports of experimental human and animal research and on published data of overdose fatalities. He compared the drugs by developing a safety ratio -- the ratio of an effective dose (eliciting a "relaxed affability") to a lethal dose. "Two drinks makes you buzzy, 20 drinks puts you in the emergency room or the morgue," Gable said in a phone interview. "Ten is the safety ratio" for alcohol, among the most toxic recreational drugs, he said. The least physiologically toxic substances -- those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death -- included marijuana when ingested. He couldn’t find any cases of documented deaths from smoked marijuana "so the actual dose is a mystery." "No drug is good for teenagers," he said, "but when it comes to the chances of immediate death by chemical toxicity, marijuana is about a hundred times less toxic than alcohol or cocaine." Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, notes: "People could argue it (marijuana) is a weaker chemical in terms of toxicity, but it does have its consequences. It doesn’t mean marijuana is harmless." Experts say one concern is the impact of marijuana on the brain, particularly for teens who start smoking early. Teitelbaum says marijuana can "flip" adolescents predisposed to mental problems into having a psychotic disorder. A 2012 study from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and the University of Otago (New Zealand) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, "Persistent Cannabis Users Show Neuropsychological Decline from Childhood to Midlife," examined the potential relationship between the long-term use of marijuana and declines in IQ scores. The study was based on data from more than 1,037 individuals followed from birth until age 38 and determined those who began using cannabis before age 18 and became persistent users (more than once a week) suffered the greatest decline in mental functioning (an average of eight IQ points) that didn’t improve once they stopped. Those who started using marijuana when they were adults didn’t show the same decline. Another concern has come up in recent years. The use of synthetic marijuana, often called Spice, has become a problem, and health professionals caution that it’s vastly different from natural marijuana and more toxic. "Many Spice smokers have experienced agitation, paranoia and mental illness," JoAnn Chambers-Emerson, certified specialist in poison information/educator at the Florida Poison Information Center in Tampa, wrote in an email. "Some Spice smokers have ended up having a stroke, heart attack, seizures and kidney failure. Synthenetic marijuana, however, is not marijuana. Our ruling An ad from the Marijuana Policy Project claims marijuana is "less toxic" than alcohol. Our job as fact-checkers in this case is not to decide whether marijuana is good or harmful. We're focused on whether the drug in its natural form is "less toxic" than alcohol. In that regard, science and statistics present a strong case: Deaths or even trips to the hospital are much more likely due to alcohol; Scientists could not find any documented deaths from smoking marijuana; A study found the safety ratio for marijuana (the number of doses to cause death) is much greater than compared to alcohol. Put another way, marijuana is 100 times less toxic than alcohol. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Marijuana Policy Project	None	None	None	2013-08-19T12:01:00	2013-08-15	['None']
pomt-09705	Health care reform "requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/04/house-republicans/public-option-could-pay-unsubsidized-abortion/	A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a line-by-line analysis of the House health care reform bill reached in-boxes all over the country, warning people of the dire consequences of the Democratic plans for reform. Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created a similar list for the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks. You can read our fact-check of the Republican analysis in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, "Page 110 - Section 222(e) requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan." We should emphasize that the House bill has yet to be voted on, and Democratic leaders have said they might consider new language on how the bill handles abortion. The Senate is expected to consider its own bill with details that diverge somewhat from the House. The latest version of the House bill incorporates an amendment proposed by Rep. Lois Capps, a Democrat from California. Her proposal sought to create a compromise on abortion, especially in regards to the public option, a basic insurance plan run by the government and offered as a choice on the health insurance exchange. The public option could offer abortion services, but if it does, those services would be paid for with segregated patient premiums, not public subsidies. We looked at the Capps amendment is some detail previously. We concluded that the Capps amendment would stop tax dollars from subsidizing abortion. The sticking point in the new Republican claim, though, is the term "federal dollars." If you consider federal dollars to be tax revenues, then the public option would not pay for abortion, because patient premiums will pay for abortion. On the other hand, if you consider "federal dollars" to be any money handled by a federal agency, then the public option would pay for abortion. We've concluded before that if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude that means more women would have access to abortion services. Our previous coverage has more detail on abortion and health care reform , and how it has been handled in the Senate. The House Republican Conference said that health reform "requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan."

pomt-09725	A request for "an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House (during the presidency of George W. Bush), including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/23/robert-gibbs/white-house-spokesman-robert-gibbs-fires-back-chen/	White House spokesman Robert Gibbs fired back at former Vice President Dick Cheney the day after Cheney said President Barack Obama "seems afraid to make a decision" about a general's public plea for 40,000 more U.S. troops in Afghanistan. "The White House must stop dithering while America's armed forces are in danger," Cheney said in a speech at the Center for Security Policy on Oct. 21. In his daily press briefing the next day, Gibbs said Cheney's comments were "curious" given that "the vice president was for seven years not focused on Afghanistan." And, Gibbs said, the comments were "even more curious given the fact that (a request for) an increase in troops sat on desks in this White House, including the vice president's, for more than eight months, a resource request filled by President Obama in March." Gibbs is referring here to a request for additional troops made by the previous top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, during President George W. Bush's final year in office. McKiernan made his requests public in a press conference in September 2008 in Afghanistan, saying he needed at least three more combat brigades, in addition to the one Bush had promised in January. He said more soldiers and resources were needed to stabilize insurgencies in Afghanistan. "The danger is that we'll be here longer and we'll expend more resources and experience more human suffering than if we had more resources placed against this campaign sooner," McKiernan told reporters. "The additional military capabilities that have been asked for are needed as quickly as possible," he said. McKiernan said then that the Pentagon validated his formal request for additional troops, and that his request dated back to when he replaced his predecessor four months prior. In a news briefing at the Pentagon on Oct. 1, 2008, McKiernan reiterated his call for more troops — "the level of effort needs to be increased" — and said he was hoping to see a shift of assets from Iraq to Afghanistan. "I know that's a choice that has to be made here in Washington," he said. "I think there's a common view that we need to do more; that Afghanistan has been an economy of force for the last several years," McKiernan said. On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 17,000 soldiers to Afghanistan. According to a story in the Baltimore Sun on Feb. 18, 2009, "The deployment is Obama's response to a long-standing request from commanders in Afghanistan for more troops. The commanders have sought four more combat brigades, aviation units and other support, representing an increase of more than 20,000 troops." In a March speech outlining a new strategy for the war there, Obama said that "for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq." Obama then seemed to take a swipe at the Bush administration when he added that he ordered the additional troops to satisfy a request that came from Gen. McKiernan "for many months." The public doesn't have access to McKiernan's formal request for more troops. But we know that he was talking about it publicly in September 2008, at least 4 1/2 months before the end of Bush's term. And McKiernan told reporters his request went back nearly to the start of his taking over as the top U.S. commander four months before that. That would suggest Gibbs' claim is correct that it had been sitting on desks in the White House for eight months. And so we rule his statement True.

pomt-12052	Rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program "will harm our economy."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/10/louise-slaughter/would-trumps-decision-daca-hurt-new-yorks-economy/	Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-Fairport, says ending an Obama immigration policy that protects children of undocumented immigrants from deportation would damage the economy. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program will expire in two years after President Trump rescinded the policy earlier this month. Almost 800,000 people benefit from the program. More than 41,000 of those recipients are in New York state, the fourth most of any state. Slaughter claimed in a tweet that ending DACA would be bad for business. "#POTUS’ decision will harm our economy and endanger the future of thousands of Americans," Slaughter tweeted. DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. They can apply to renew their status after those two years. DACA recipients have many of the same obligations as permanent U.S. residents, like paying income tax. But will ending DACA be bad for the economy? Origin of the data Slaughter's claim comes from a recent report by the Center of American Progress, a left-leaning policy research organization. It estimated the U.S. would lose $460.3 billion over a decade if working DACA recipients were deported. New York state would lose $2.6 billion each year. "We're saying this is what would be taken away if these DACA recipients were taken out of the workforce," said Philip Wolgin, managing director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. The organization based its figure on a 2016 report from two economics professors at Queens College. The professors predicted the U.S. would lose $4.7 trillion in gross domestic product by 2026 if all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country were deported. Analysts from the Center for American Progress narrowed that finding to immigrants in the labor force protected under DACA. "We looked at how many unauthorized workers there were and what the impact was of losing them," said Silva Mathema, a senior policy analyst at the Center for American Progress. "We take that and we apply it to looking at the DACA workers." The analysts applied the same logic to each state, with a few caveats. The analysts assumed the labor characteristics of the DACA workforce were the same as other undocumented workers. The data applies only to DACA recipients who are employed, which the analysts estimated to be about 87 percent in each state. Other research Researchers on the other side of the political spectrum agree ending DACA would harm the country’s economy, but they dispute the amount. The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy group, estimated the national economy would lose $283 billion over the next decade if all DACA recipients were deported. New York alone would lose more than $49.4 billion in that time - more than $5 billion a year. "The actual number may vary but all of the estimates find that DACA will shrink GDP," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. "The magnitude of GDP loss is in doubt but there is no doubt that GDP will shrink once DACA starts to expire." Where's that money coming from? A small part of the lost economic contribution is tax receipts. Undocumented immigrants eligible for DACA contribute more than $2 billion in state and local taxes each year, according to research from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. More than $140 million comes from DACA eligible immigrants in New York state. The bigger part is that DACA allows immigrants to enter the labor force without restrictions, creating a domino effect that’s good for business. "When you have people working it helps the larger economic activity of the area," Wolgin said. "When there’s a bigger supply of immigrants, businesses ramp up their business and their hiring." At the same time, these immigrants are not eligible for most public benefits, like Medicaid or food stamps. Our ruling Slaughter said ending DACA would harm the economy. Researchers dispute the amount but confirm Slaughter’s claim that deporting DACA recipients would do more harm than good for the economy. We rate her claim True.

pomt-03642	For people with insurance, the only impact of the health care law "is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/02/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-people-health-insuranc/	Most Americans don’t need to worry about Obamacare "glitches and bumps" that may come next year, President Barack Obama says. All the parts of the health care law that affect them are already in place, and it’s all been good, he told reporters at a White House news conference on April 30, 2013. "For the average American out there, for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing has already happened," he said. "And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else." The president’s unequivocal language caught our eye. More than 20 provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to take effect. Are most folks — those who already have health insurance — in the clear? Experts told us the reality is somewhat more complex. ‘A huge train wreck’ The president had been asked to respond to a recent comment from Sen. Max Baucus, a Democratic architect of the law, that rollout might be a "a huge train wreck." Baucus said at an April hearing that he was "very concerned" that not enough had been done to educate people about changes on the way. Big shifts include new state- and federal-run health insurance exchanges, rules about what policies on the exchanges must offer and a requirement that everyone have insurance. And those are just three of more than 20 provisions to take effect between now and 2018, according to a time line from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent nonprofit group that’s closely followed the law. But Obama told reporters at his news conference that any "implementation issues" wouldn’t apply to the majority of Americans who already have health insurance. Instead, he clarified, they would affect only "the small group of people … who don't have health insurance right now or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isn't that great." In other words, he was already correcting himself. But did he go far enough? The ‘85 to 90 percent’ The president had offered blanket reassurance that "the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance" had nothing left to worry about. He’s right that about 85 percent of folks have some kind of health insurance, according to the most recent Census survey of health coverage. Nearly 16 percent said they didn’t have any coverage in 2011. Which means Obama was telling a fairly diverse group of people they had already experienced what the health care law had to offer them: Folks with health coverage through their employers (55 percent), through government programs such as Medicaid (17 percent) and Medicare (15 percent), through policies they buy themselves (10 percent) and through the military (4 percent). (Those numbers add up to more than 85 percent because the categories aren’t exclusive — some people have more than one kind of coverage.) ‘Stronger, better and more secure’ For all of those people, Obama said, the "only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it." There certainly have been helpful impacts: protection for people with pre-existing conditions, elimination of lifetime limits, coverage of 26-year-olds on their parents’ policies and no-fee preventive care. But those haven’t been the "only" impacts. "I think there's quite a bit more," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who has been a critic of the law. Some people who have insurance now may face: • Higher taxes • More comprehensive, and thus more expensive, policies • Employers who opt out, self-insure or move toward part-time employees • Health care providers who no longer take Medicaid or Medicare But those possibilities apply to small, specific groups of people — or it’s not yet clear how widespread they may be. Higher taxes, for example, include new restrictions on tax-free health accounts, a higher threshold for deducting unreimbursed medical expenses and a higher Medicare Part A insurance tax for high-income families. Then there are higher taxes on pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurers and employers — costs which may be passed on to consumers. "People will feel those effects as well," said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. But recent headlines about higher premiums — such as a request for a 25 percent hike by a Maryland insurer and a recent study showing underlying medical costs for individual policyholders may rise 32 percent — only apply to the individual market. That is, the less than 10 percent of people who buy their own insurance. Cheaper policies with fewer benefits — perhaps more than half of what’s offered on the individual market now — simply won’t be available on new insurance exchanges. But some people will qualify for new subsidies to offset higher premiums on their better, more expensive policies. Then there are anecdotal worries about employers opting out, self-insuring or moving toward part-time employees. But it’s hard to say how big the effect will be on currently insured workers, or which companies will follow through on their tests. Darden Restaurants, which infamously experimented with shifting more of its workers to part-time to avoid offering insurance, faced "considerable backlash," according to NPR, and backed off. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that unions are pushing for federal subsidies to keep offering plans jointly with employers to some 20 million people, warning that they may drop coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that employers will drop coverage for about 8 million people in 2019 — less than 3 percent of Americans — while people insured through exchanges will leap by 27 million. Meanwhile, Medicare savings under the health care law include reductions in payments for hospitals and nursing homes, which Medicare’s actuary has warned may make it hard for about 15 percent of them to stay profitable. Doctors have also had to fight off scheduled payment reductions, and some have limited their number of Medicare and Medicaid patients. "Medicare is in as much trouble as it ever was," said Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management, business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. In other words, at least some people with insurance now do face Obamacare implementation worries, as their employers and insurers grapple with how to adjust to changes under the law. But it’s not most people, Pauly and a few other experts told us. "I think the story isn't over yet, and there will be surprises and disruptions for some people, even if the overall impact is stronger, better and more secure," said Tim Jost, a health care expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law. Employees who get insurance through large employers, in particular, face the least uncertainty. "There isn't going to be a major financial impact on them," Jost said. "And they'll have some benefit." But Obama got into trouble by punctuating his point with phrases like the "only impact," "full stop" and "that’s it." That’s just an exaggeration, Wilensky said. "He really put an exclamation point on it, which, yeah, doesn't hold," Tanner said. Our ruling Obama attempted to reassure Americans that for most of them, Obamacare "has already happened." He went on: "And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better and more secure than it was before. Full stop. That's it. They don't have to worry about anything else." He glossed over other impacts of the law, including higher taxes and in some cases, higher premiums. Meanwhile, some people who have insurance now will have to deal with changes from their employers, insurers and health care providers. Most people who have large-group coverage through their employers now face little change, experts told us. So for many of those people, Obama was largely correct. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-02511	Says Michele Bachmann said "English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/feb/12/facebook-posts/bachmann-didnt-say-bible-was-written-english-and-n/	After Coca-Cola aired a multilingual Super Bowl ad, a photo-quotation circulated on Facebook suggesting that U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., disapproved. The Coke ad, featuring "America the Beautiful" sung in seven languages, provoked a backlash on Twitter and criticism from conservatives who objected to hearing parts of the patriotic song performed in tongues other than English. "If English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible it should be good enough for Coke," Bachmann is quoted as saying in the graphic posted Feb. 3, 2014, by "Christians for Michele Bachmann." It attributes the alleged quote to a Fox News appearance that same day. Bachmann, a former presidential candidate, has supported making English the official language of the U.S., but we found no evidence that she uttered the "good enough for Jesus" line. Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman told us by email, "Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and actually didn’t even appear on Fox News that day. It’s 100 percent fake." It’s fake — and not even new. A hoax-debunking blog called Waffles at Noon collected 2013 versions of the Bachmann meme in a Feb. 4, 2014, post, and said the earliest one also bore the logo of "Christians for Michele Bachmann," which it described as a satirical Facebook page. But it didn’t start with Bachmann. We found that the "Bible written in English" line is so old it was used to make fun of Texas’ 1925-27 governor, Miriam Ferguson, to whom versions have also been attributed. And it’s even older than that, tracing back to at least 1881. Wall Street Journal language columnist Benjamin Zimmer investigated the "Bible in English" meme in an April 29, 2006, post on a linguists’ blog at the University of Pennsylvania. The oldest iterations, he wrote, were jokes about an 1881 translation of the Bible, rather than about the English language specifically. Zimmer cited a May 23, 1881, New York Times story about clergymen’s reactions to the new Bible. One preacher, the story says, told his congregation a joke that ended thus: " ’What's the matter with the good old King James version?’ the farmer replied. ‘That was good enough for St. Paul, and it's good enough for me.’ " Word sleuth Barry Popik of New York, a onetime Texas resident who has compiled an online etymological dictionary, investigated the Texas connection in an Aug. 10, 2006, post on his website. Popik wrote that quotations such as "If English was good enough for Jesus, it’s good enough for Texas" were attributed to Ferguson or her husband, also a former governor, as commentary on a period of Texas history when there was controversy over public schools teaching in Spanish. Our ruling The Facebook post claims Bachmann said, "If English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible, it should be good enough for Coke."

pomt-06454	Says more than 1 million Texans are jobless, the state has its highest unemployment rate in more than 20 years and joblessness doubled on Rick Perry’s watch.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-paints-dire-picture-unemployment-rick-/	A video posted this week on a Mitt Romney website (for the moment dedicated to Rick Perry) shows tumbleweeds blowing across an empty highway behind headlines indicating the Texas economy is sinking fast with Perry at the state’s helm. The video, titled "The Facts," trumpets these eye-catching claims: "Over 1 million Texans out of work" "Highest unemployment rate in Texas in over 20 years" "Unemployment has doubled on Perry’s watch" These claims are traced in Romney’s video to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Fair enough. Information from the agency, a reliable source for job-related calculations, earlier helped us confirm that 1.04 million Texans were unemployed as of August 2011, the latest month for which such data were available. Also correct, per the bureau: The state’s August 2011 unemployment rate, 8.5 percent, was the highest Texas had experienced since the 9.3 percent rate reached in November 1986, nearly 25 years before. Finally, the unemployment rate has doubled during Perry’s governorship -- going from 4.2 percent in December 2000 to 8.5 percent in August 2011. However, we rated a previous Romney claim to this effect Half True. Experts reminded us that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Put another way, neither Romney nor Perry merits credit or blame for job conditions in their respective states. Economies rise and fall due to many conditions beyond a governor’s sway. That should make the next debate a lot shorter, shouldn’t it? The logical weakness in blaming a state’s governor for the state’s jobless residents and unemployment rate makes Romney’s triple-barreled claim Half True.

pomt-09556	On a bipartisan task force on ways to improve fiscal policy.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/01/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-reverses-position-conrad-gregg-budget-co/	Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was gung-ho behind an amendment intended to improve federal fiscal health. The proposal -- a "Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action" -- was co-sponsored by the top Democrat and the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H. It would establish an 18-member bipartisan commission to study the current and future fiscal condition of the federal government and make recommendations about how revenues and expenses can be brought into line. Those recommendations would be fast-tracked to the House and Senate floors under a special procedure. In a May 12, 2009, Senate floor session to discuss the Medicare Trustees' Report, McConnell said, "We must address the issue of entitlement spending now before it is too late. As I have said many times before, the best way to address the crisis is the Conrad-Gregg proposal, which would provide an expedited pathway for fixing these profound long-term challenges. This plan would force us to get debt and spending under control. It deserves support from both sides of the aisle. The administration has expressed a desire to take up entitlement reform, and given the debt that its budget would run up, the need for reform has never been greater. So I urge the administration, once again, to support the Conrad-Gregg proposal. This proposal is our best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation’s fiscal future." That's a pretty clear endorsement of a bill, even though McConnell was not a co-sponsor. We tracked down one other occasion when McConnell spoke favorably about the bill. According to an Associated Press account at the time, McConnell also advocated the Conrad-Gregg approach in comments at a Feb. 23, 2009, White House summit on fiscal responsibility. But then, on Jan. 26, 2010, when the Conrad-Gregg bill, originally introduced as S. 2853, came for a vote in the Senate, it fell seven votes shy of the Senate's 60-vote threshold for passage, garnering 53 yeas and 46 nays, with one senator not voting. The measure would have passed with 60 votes if only seven additional Republicans who had co-sponsored S. 2853 had voted for it. Instead, those seven -- Robert Bennett of Utah, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Ensign of Nevada, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, James Inhofe of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona -- withdrew their co-sponsorship in the days before the vote and then voted against it on the floor. But the Senate Republican leader from Kentucky has probably taken the most flak on the issue for voting "no." In a scathing Washington Post op-ed column on Feb. 1, 2010, Fred Hiatt, referring to McConnell's "no" vote on the commission, wrote that "no single vote by any single senator could possibly illustrate everything that is wrong with Washington today. No single vote could embody the full cynicism and cowardice of our political elite at its worst, or explain by itself why problems do not get solved. But here's one that comes close." Hiatt continued that "it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that the only thing that changed since May is the political usefulness of the proposal to McConnell's partisan goals. He was happy to claim fiscal responsibility while beating up Obama for fiscal recklessness. But when Obama endorsed the idea, as he did on the Saturday before the vote -- and when the commission actually, against all odds, had the wisp of a chance of winning the needed 60 Senate votes -- McConnell bailed." Meanwhile, on the same day Hiatt's column was published, the president himself urged McConnell by name to change his mind about the commission, during remarks on his administration's proposed 2011 budget. "I hope that, despite the fact that it got voted down in the Senate, that both the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, and the Republican leader in the House, John Boehner, go ahead and fully embrace what has been a bipartisan idea to get our arms around this budget." So did McConnell flip-flop on his position? At the time of the vote, many Republicans were coming under pressure from antitax activists to oppose such a commission. These activists argued that it would have opened the door to tax increases. (Bennett, Hutchison and McCain are under special pressure because they face difficult primaries this fall from challengers on their right.) For their part, many Democrats voted against establishing a commission amid pressure by liberal interest groups that worried that the commission could recommend deep cuts to spending programs. When we asked McConnell's staffers whether they had any explanation for the senator's switch, a spokesman referred us to what McConnell had said in a Jan. 31, 2010, interview with John King, the host of CNN's Sunday-morning show, State of the Union. In that interview, King said to McConnell, "If this was such a good idea that they would co-sponsor it -- this is what comes up, Sen. McConnell, in my travels all the time. People say, why do they always just play politics in Washington? Is this just politics, as the president says, or if it was the same proposal six months ago when they co-sponsored it, what was wrong with it last week when a Democratic president wanted it?" McConnell responded by throwing the blame back on the president, who he said was, at best, uninterested in the idea until Senate Democrats -- under pressure to pass a politically unpopular increase to the federal debt limit -- urged him to back the bill as cover. "Well, what was wrong with it last year?" McConnell said to King. "I mean, I discussed this very issue with the president right after he came to office, and with his chief of staff. Never could get a commitment out of him. In the meantime, we've seen a year now in which we've been on a spending binge. They passed a budget that doubled the national debt in five years and tripled it in 10. There's a lot of skepticism now about whether -- and the president endorses this commission a couple of days before the vote [on the debt-limit bill]. Where was he a year ago when we were talking to him about it?" (We recently fact-checked the point McConnell made about the debt tripling in 10 years and found some caveats.) McConnell also told King that he still favors the commission model, and in fact voted for an alternative amendment that would have established a commission to propose spending cuts. But unlike the Conrad-Gregg commission, the one that McConnell -- as well as the seven former co-sponsors of the Conrad-Gregg commission -- backed would not entertain the possibility of tax increases, something that Conrad and Gregg maintained had to remain on the table. When King asserted that a commission that didn't address tax increases would suit Republicans' political purposes, McConnell responded, "Look, nobody thinks raising taxes in the middle of a recession is a good idea. Have you ever heard anybody say that? I don't think so. We're in the middle of a recession. We've got 10 percent unemployment. ... Look, I don't think anybody in the country thinks we have a problem because we tax too little. I think the problem is we spend too much. So I like the commission idea, just as I said a few months ago. I think a better way to do it is to target spending, a spending reduction commission." Independent sources agree that McConnell has a point that Obama was also inconsistent about the merits of Conrad-Gregg commission. Gregg, according to the New York Times, said the president "may be a little too late to the party" given the intensity of opposition "from people who don't want any scent of tax increases." Still, Obama had never come out as forcefully against the proposal as McConnell had in favor of it prior to switching sides. As we indicated earlier, McConnell was not a co-sponsor of S. 2853. However, he is not only on record praising the measure just eight months earlier but is also on record saying that he had praised it on numerous occasions. We rate McConnell's stance on the Conrad-Gregg commission a Full Flop.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2010-02-01T19:03:37	2009-05-12	['None']
pomt-04962	"There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check … 40 percent of guns are sold that way" at gun shows and over the Internet.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/michael-bloomberg/mayor-michael-bloomberg-says-40-percent-guns-are-s/	Editor’s note: We first fact-checked this statement on July 25, 2012, and rated it Mostly True. After the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14, 2012, other people repeated this statistic, and new criticism of the 40 percent figure emerged. At the request of readers, we looked at the statement again, did additional reporting, and changed our rating to Half True on Jan. 30, 2013. The original item is archived here; the fact-check below reflects our additional reporting and new rating. As the nation absorbed the news about the shooting deaths in a Colorado movie theater, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was scathing in his criticism of the National Rifle Association. On CBS’ Face the Nation in July 2012, Bloomberg accused the NRA of being "adamant about no controls on weapons." He said the pro-gun group leans on Congress and the White House and blocks funding for officials to enforce laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable. "We don't need more laws. We need a couple of fixes," Bloomberg said. "There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, 40 percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet. … The NRA has opposed anything." Here, we will check Bloomberg’s statement that "you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet." His phrasing is a little awkward, but his staff told us he meant that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background check, either at gun shows or on the Internet. Current law Buying a gun has required a background check since the Brady Act took effect in 1994. (James Brady was badly wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan; he was Reagan’s press secretary.) Under the law, federally licensed dealers must verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime or declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. Typically this is done online and takes less than a day. But only licensed dealers must do this. The law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. If a private seller suspects that a buyer would be disqualified under federal rules, then they can’t go through with the sale. But there is no background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork. Bloomberg’s office pointed us to a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice on who owns guns and how they use them.The researchers estimated that about 40 percent of all firearm sales took place through people other than licensed dealers. They based their conclusion on data from a 1994 survey of more than 2,500 households. But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun. We asked Philip Cook, a Duke University professor who co-authored the study, if he thinks that 40 percent estimate -- which is now more than 15 years old -- is still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales. "The answer is I have no idea," Cook said. "This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number." Other scholars had similar views. Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. "Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows," he told us. On the other hand, not much has changed in the gun market in the past two decades. "It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little," said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem." McCrie said, "The 40 percent seems about right." Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, told PolitiFact the 40 percent estimate is "probably still reasonably valid today." Little other evidence In 1999, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released a report on gun shows. Investigators found that a quarter of the vendors were private sellers, not licensed dealers, and reported that "felons and other prohibited persons who want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchase buy firearms at these shows." They said guns from such shows had been used in drug crimes. We called the ATF and asked if there was anything more recent. They had nothing new to add. We called the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, groups that oppose new efforts to track gun transactions. Neither organization responded. The City of New York commissioned an investigation of Internet gun sales in 2011. The report said on 10 websites, it found over 25,000 weapons for sale.The report said that over 60 percent of sellers allowed a purchase to move forward even when the alleged buyer said he didn’t believe he would pass a background check. Our ruling Bloomberg said 40 percent of gun sales take place through gun shows or the Internet, without a background check. The best information on the informal gun market is based on a survey and is about 15 years old (the data used in the survey is almost 20 years old). There’s no question that many guns are bought with no background check, but there’s not sufficient current evidence to say that the proportion is 40 percent of all sales. Bloomberg’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out that important detail: Half True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2012-07-25T11:46:03	2012-07-22	['None']
pomt-04424	"President Obama has worked to change Medicare for the worse" by "creating an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/15/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-says-obama-has-hurt-medicare/	The Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law known commonly as Obamacare, remains a hot button subject in political campaigns. Not surprisingly, many claims made about the law in the 2010 campaign season are circulating again. Several appear in a brochure the Ohio Republican Party sent to voters in support of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. The brochure is aimed specifically at seniors. It says they can count on Romney, but not on President Obama, who "has worked to change Medicare for the worse." One of the ways Obama has done that, the mailing says, is by "creating an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments." That statement echoed several similar claims PolitiFact has checked about the health care law and the unelected Independent Payments Advisory Board, or IPAB for short. For this fact-check, we will borrow from our previous items to explain the board and the brochure's claim. Some of our information comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that studies health care, which put out a primer in 2010 about the board and a longer paper in 2011. Just what is IPAB? The board was created by the 2010 health care law in response to criticism that Congress has been unwilling or unable to slow the increasing costs of Medicare, the federal program that pays for seniors’ health care. Under the health care reform law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed pre-set targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendations within a set time, IPAB’s recommendations automatically go into effect. (For a more detailed explanation of how this would work, we recommend this April 2011 report from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.) The IPAB can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions, or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some argue that because the IPAB can reduce what the government pays health care providers, its decisions could ultimately impact what services are available to patients. But IPAB recommendations themselves would not apply to any particular individual. Rather, they would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given the claim's wording that IPAB could "deny coverage of certain treatments," some readers could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case. Still, the IPAB has become one of the more contentious points of the health care law; even some members of Congress who voted for the overall health care law don’t like the IPAB. Congress held hearings earlier this year on repealing the board. The hearings were organized by opponents of the IPAB, but people who testified raised concerns that IPAB’s powers are so limited that its only real recourse is to reduce payments for doctors and other health care providers, which could end up putting pressure on patient care. We should note that these concerns are also present under the current system, in which Congress takes a more active role. Limits on its powers There are restrictions on what IPAB can recommend in the name of cost savings. It cannot raise rates, reduce benefits, drop beneficiaries or ration care. Here’s the exact language from the law itself: "The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria." The brochure calls the IPAB an "unelected, unaccountable panel." Its 15 full-time members aren’t elected. But that doesn’t mean they’re unaccountable. • They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. • They can’t serve more than two six-year terms. • Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress. • They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can’t perform other jobs as they serve. • They can be removed by the president for "neglect of duty" or "malfeasance in office," though not for any other reason. In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board’s decisions from special-interest lobbying: Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act. Implementation of its recommendations isn’t subject to administrative or judicial review. So while their decisions are protected by law, board members are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president. The mailing by the Ohio Republican Party said "President Obama is weakening Medicare as we know it" by "creating an unelected, unaccountable panel with the power to deny coverage of certain treatments." Truth-O-Meter rating There’s an small element of truth in the claim. Board members aren’t elected. And the board will make decisions that arguably could impact the availability of services. But it’s a stretch to say the members of the board are entirely unaccountable. They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They’re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don’t meet growth targets — but Congress can overrule their recommendations. And describing the board as having "the power to deny coverage of certain treatments" could lead readers to believe the board will sit around a table and talk about individual cases, like whether grandpa can get his bypass or not, and that’s not the case. The board won’t look at individual patients or deny individual treatments. Instead, it will make system-wide recommendations to rein in the future growth of Medicare spending, and it makes those recommendations within limited parameters. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the GOP mailer rates Mostly False.

pomt-13021	"NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico, for example, to leave there and ... drive straight through without even being inspected."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/dec/05/roger-williams/mostly-false-roger-williams-claim-lot-trucks-not-i/	A Texas congressman aware that President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement says that right now, many potentially dangerous trucks roll uninspected from Mexico into the U.S. Roger Williams, a Republican car dealer, called himself a "free trade guy" in an interview with Alex Daugherty of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The resulting November 2016 McClatchy news story also quoted Williams saying: "NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico. ... They can drive through without even being inspected. That concerns me." We wondered if Williams, whose district runs from Austin north and west nearly into Tarrant County, was right about uninspected trucks. To be sure, the 1994 trade agreement committed the bordering nations to allowing each other’s trucks to carry goods across the border and make deliveries anywhere inside their respective countries. But implementation proved bumpy, we learned, and few trucks from Mexico lately trundle outside of border commercial zones. Also, trucks from Mexico might not be safety threats in themselves. A federal pilot project -- involving over 900 long-haul trucks traveling from Mexico over three years ending in fall 2014 -- showed "Mexico-domiciled motor carriers operating beyond the commercial zones" on the border "had safety records that were equal to or better than the national average for U.S. and Canadian motor carriers operating in the United States," the Department of Transportation told Congress in 2015. Still, are a lot of trucks rumbling across the border uninspected? We sent emails inquiring into Williams’ factual backup and asking Customs and Border Protection, the agency most associated with border security, to assess his claim. A Williams’ spokesman, Vince Zito, responded by phone that Williams based his assessment on his background as Texas secretary of state, whose duties include border issues, and past membership of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Outside analysis Before hearing back from CBP, we connected with experts including Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Wilson advised that only a handful of Mexico-based carriers currently haul cargo beyond the commercial zones along the border. Reason: It’s often unprofitable, Wilson and Juan Carlos Villa, who studies freight traffic across the border for the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, told us by phone. A key issue is that under "cabotage" regulations, a truck that originates in Mexico may drop off goods in the U.S. interior but can’t also move goods solely within the U.S. And, Villa said, while a Mexico-rooted truck may haul a U.S. load back to Mexico, lining up such cargo can prove difficult, causing costly delays. In contrast, the alternative--driving an empty trailer back to Mexico--"doesn’t make business sense," Villa said. A web search led us to 2012 Department of Homeland Security guidelines confirming the described limits. Another deterrence to long-haul trucks venturing into the interior from Mexico, Wilson said, are the typically long delays at border crossings. As a result, Wilson said, it's more commonplace for other trucks to trundle cargo into the U.S. commercial zones where transfers are then made to U.S. lines, a practice called drayage. Wilson, asked to appraise Williams’ claim, said: "I don’t know what kind of inspection he means. We don’t allow anyone into the United States without some level of inspection." Officials don’t open every car trunk, every suitcase or every cargo load, he said, but all vehicles are scanned for nuclear material and some are subject to x-ray checks. "My interpretation of what ‘good inspection’ means is using intelligence to selectively inspect at varying degrees and with various tools" each vehicle’s "cargo based on an evaluation of risk. And that is what we do on the border today," Wilson said. "In that sense, no one makes it across without inspection." To our query, Villa estimated that 99.9 percent of Mexico-based trucks entering the U.S. stay within the border commercial zones. Also, Villa said, every truck is screened for safety at the border by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (in the Department of Transportation) and, in Texas, the Texas Department of Public Safety -- with the CBP handling security screenings. When we asked the FMCSA about trucks going uninspected, spokesman Duane DeBruyne said by email that Mexico-based trucks permitted to bring goods beyond the border are randomly selected for border safety inspections. Also, DeBruyne said, each interior-bound truck must display a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance decal to operate in the U.S. He said the decals must be renewed via a "thorough safety" inspection every 90 days. More detail: A March 2002 agency "fact sheet" on NAFTA-related transportation regulations states: "Mexican-domiciled carriers" entering the U.S. are required to have a drug and alcohol-testing program, a system of compliance with U.S. federal hours-of-service requirements, adequate data and safety management systems, and valid insurance with a U.S.-registered insurance company. Villa said each border security screening starts with a CBP officer looking at a truck and checking an electronic manifest of the truck’s contents including information about the driver. The agency’s system then guides the officer on whether to let the truck exit into the country or proceed to a secondary inspection, Villa said, which could involve X-rays and unpacking cargo. If a shipment is registered with a U.S. program intended to ease movement of goods, Villa said, the truck is usually directed to exit without secondary inspection. CBP describes its Free and Secure Trade program as a "commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments" entering the country that allows "expedited processing for commercial carriers who have completed background checks and fulfill certain eligibility requirements." Participation, CBP says, "requires that every link in the supply chain, from manufacturer to carrier to driver to importer, is certified under the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program," a public-private partnership focused on protecting the supply chain, identifying security gaps and implementing security measures. Customs & Border Protection CBP spokesman Roger Maier ultimately sent an email describing the agency’s border role in a similar way. "All commercial trucks entering the U.S. from Mexico are subject to CBP inspection," Maier said. "CBP also receives advance cargo manifest information on all shipments arriving at ports of entry. Some shipment will receive expedited processing if they have successfully enrolled in the CBP FAST trusted trader program." Asked if a lot of trucks get through uninspected, Maier replied: "All arriving trucks are met and processed by a CBP officer. Some go gate to gate if they are FAST and there are no issues. Others face some form of physical or non-intrusive exams. All manifests are reviewed in advance." Our ruling Williams said a lot of trucks from Mexico drive into the U.S. without being inspected. Our research showed that not all trucks are searched, a fact giving an element of truth to this statement, for which Williams provided no specific backup. However, no vehicles cross the border without a visual screening and trucks also are subject to electronic scans and random hands-on safety and security inspections. Also, any truck headed to the nation’s interior is required to fulfill various requirements including a safety inspection within the previous 90 days. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10510	It's "common knowledge" that al-Qaida is receiving training from Iran.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/19/john-mccain/iran-and-al-qaida-dont-agree-on-religion/	We're not trying to pile on Sen. John McCain over his misstatement on the link between Iran and al-Qaida. Maybe he was confused for a moment. He did correct himself quickly. Still, it's worth exploring why McCain's statement is wrong. "It's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaida is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran; that's well known. And it's unfortunate," McCain said during a news conference in Jordan. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who was also at the news conference, spoke softly in McCain's ear, and McCain corrected himself to say "Islamic extremists" were going into Iran. Most experts do not believe Iran is helping al-Qaida because their respective religious affiliations are at odds with each other. Both sides are Muslim, but the Iranian government is Shiite while al-Qaida is Sunni. And al-Qaida adheres to a fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam that considers Shiites to be apostates. It's not likely the two groups would work together, certainly not "common knowledge." In Iraq, both al-Qaida and Shiite extremists are commonly believed to be committing acts of violence. But it was al-Qaida that was behind the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, not Shiite extremists. McCain is not the first elected official to get these differences wrong. In 2006, Silvestre Reyes, the new Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, couldn't correctly identify whether al-Qaida was Sunni or Shiite. He was asked about the issue by Congressional Quarterly columnist Jeff Stein. Stein, who writes the SpyTalk column for CQ, said he began asking national security officials if they knew the difference between Sunnis and Shiites, and which countries were on which side, when he suspected they didn't know what they were talking about. Many gave wrong answers. Some claimed it was a "gotcha" question, but Stein disagreed, particularly mentioning the division between Iran and al-Qaida. "It seems silly to have to argue that officials responsible for counterterrorism should be able to recognize opportunities for pitting these rivals against each other," Stein wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times in 2005. The difference between Sunnis and Shiites goes back 1,400 years, to the founding of the Islamic religion. After the death of the Prophet Mohammed, his followers split over who should be the next leader: a relative of the prophet or a nonrelated successor chosen on merit. Those who wanted a relative became Shiites, while those who chose the nonrelative eventually became Sunnis. Today, Shiites represent about 15 percent of 1.3-billion Muslims worldwide. Iran is predominantly Shiite, while Iraq has a slight Shiite majority. There are also significant numbers of Shiites in Lebanon and Syria. (Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, is an extremist Shiite group.) The rest of the Islamic world is mostly Sunni, though many Sunni countries have Shiite minorities. Saudi Arabia has an estimated 4-million Shiites out of a total population of 27-million, and Shiites there face discrimination. Under Saddam Hussein, Sunnis were the ruling class of Iraq, even though the country was majority Shiite. That division has hurt U.S. efforts to unify the country. McCain recovered quickly, but we still rate his statement False for saying that everyone knows Iran and al-Qaida are working together.

pomt-14557	The Seminole gambling compact offers "$3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/11/seminole-tribe-florida/new-gaming-compact-offers-florida-biggest-guarante/	The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. "The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly," the commercial said. That’s a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribe’s favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but here’s a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasn’t been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles’ commercial says? It’s the "guaranteed" part that tips the tribe’s hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, we’re just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. That’s especially true when considering states like Connecticut, which receives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lion’s share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also don’t have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesn’t hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. "The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Florida’s really amounts to a rounding error," he said. "It’s about expanding gambling in Florida. And if you’re for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else?" Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers "$3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history." The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts. Some states have compacts with many other tribes. Some deals call for tribes to split a portion of revenues only with local governments. The takeaway from the ad is Florida is getting the best financial deal of any state in the country, but the finer points aren't clear. We're going to hedge our bets and rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Seminole Tribe of Florida	None	None	None	2016-02-11T14:21:04	2016-02-03	['None']
pomt-02654	"The median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation adjusted, for 30 years, basically."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/15/rana-foroohar/times-rana-foroohar-says-median-male-worker-hasnt-/	For all the advances since the era of teased-out rocker hair, one thing hasn’t changed for America’s average working man: the amount of bacon he brings home. So says Rana Foroohar, a CNN global economic analyst and Time magazine assistant managing editor (who, by the way, snagged the first interview with new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen). Appearing on CNN’s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Foroohar brought up the point during a general discussion about the country’s economic woes. "You know, I have to jump in on this because we are living in a time when the corporate share of the overall economic pie is as high as it has been in decades," Foroohar said. "Meanwhile, the median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation-adjusted, for 30 years, basically." Foroohar’s eye-popping statistic about median male worker income is certainly interesting. We wanted to know if it is correct. Comparing 1982-2012 The U.S. Census Bureau proved a go-to source. The bureau’s September report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage in 2012 contains text and tables outlining historical changes (or lack thereof) in earnings for both men and women. Foroohar referenced median earnings, which experts say is a better measure than the average because the income difference between the country’s rich and working-class earners is stark. In 2012, the latest year for which data is available, the median full-time, year-round male worker earned $49,398. In 1982, exactly 30 years earlier, earnings in 2012 dollars were $48,152. So from 1982 to 2012, there was actually an inflation-adjusted raise of $1,246. But that’s more because Foroohar is looking at two years in isolation. Tracking the income of median male workers over time shows that incomes climbed steeply from 1960 to 1970. But the figure has ebbed and flowed and remained mostly stagnant since 1970, dipping as low as $46,841 in 1996 and reaching a high of $51,670 in 1973. (You can view the table on page 50 of the report.) Point being: You could just as easily widen or shrink Foroohar’s 30-year window by a few years and find a number that supports her point. Median earnings of the 2012 male worker are down compared to his counterpart 25 years ago (who earned $50,166 in 1987), 35 years ago ($50,480 in 1977) or 40 years ago ($50,074 in 1970). Even though Foroohar’s window shows a 2.6 percent pay increase between 1982 and 2012, it’s really "pretty close to flat," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "It means that male median earnings increases just 0.085 percent per year (that is, 85 one-thousandths of a percentage point per year)," he said. Some say men are even worse off Foroohar’s larger point, while technically correct and oft-repeated, misses the larger economic picture and is actually too generous, argues Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Greenstone co-authored a 2012 New York Times post with Brookings fellow Adam Looney that presented another way to examine median male wages. Instead of counting only the earnings of men with jobs, as the Census Bureau does, Greenstone factored in all working-age men. Factoring in men without jobs brings down the median income. The fraction of men in the workforce has declined sharply over the last several decades, he wrote, from 94 percent of prime-age men working in 1970 to 81 percent in 2010. It happened as incarceration rates and enrollment in the Social Security disability insurance program increased and labor force participation waned, as well as the "wild success" of women entering the labor market, he said. His 2012 study found real earnings of median males actually dropped by 19 percent since 1970, he found. "This means that the median man in 2010 earned as much as the median man did in 1964 — nearly a half century ago." The reasons for the trend are complex, Greenstone told us. Yes, there have been sweeping changes in technology, machinery and trade over the last 30 or 40 years that have had some effect. More striking, he said, is that educational attainment among men, which used to climb with each generation, has dropped off. "The decline in working is concentrated among the men who have lower levels of education," Greenstone said. "It’s not concentrated among the college-grad guy who is married to a super successful woman." Michael Saltsman of the conservative Employment Policies Institute also argued the idea of "stagnant" wages is more controversial than it seems -- to a different end. He cited a 2012 study in the National Tax Journal that analyzed middle-class income from the past three cycles. Instead of using pre-tax income data, the researchers expanded the income definition to include taxes, income transfers and fringe benefits. "Middle-class Americans are found to have made substantial gains, and these increases are even larger when including non-cash income, such as the ex-ante value of health insurance," the report says. Meanwhile, the earnings of female workers isn’t cited as often as a metric of the economy because their participation in the workforce jumped sharply over the last 50 years. In any case, the 2012 full-time, year-round median female worker earned $37,791, according to census figures. In 1982, when about half as many women were working, median earnings were $29,731. Our ruling Foroohar said, "the median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation-adjusted, for 30 years, basically." Federal data for 1982-2012 shows a slight increase, though the numbers show the real value of median male earnings have been in the range of $46,840-$51,670 for about 40 years. We found another point of view that says the real median income has declined significantly once men without jobs are factored in. We also found a broader definition of income that changes the dynamic. Still, Foroohar clearly has a point. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14879	"Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/mike-huckabee/huckabee-most-syrian-refugees-are-not-syrian-free-/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee questioned the motives and origins of "so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ " during the Nov. 10 undercard GOP debate. While Huckabee, a former pastor, says he’s concerned about the plight of Christians in the region, he dismissed the idea of the United States accepting whoever — as he put it — wants free sandwiches and health care. "We have no idea who these people are. What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian," Huckabee said. "Are we going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we’ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?" We were curious about Huckabee’s claim that the majority of the refugees don’t come from Syria. Huckabee’s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said "four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria." (The article’s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.) We found that the Daily Mail’s and Huckabee’s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees. According to the Daily Mail, the European Union "logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war." Those figures are lifted from Eurostat’s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail’s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee’s extrapolation even more so. First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee’s phrasing — "so-called Syrian refugees" — suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat’s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. The Guardian explains why this distorts the refugee situation: "If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states." (Huckabee’s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.) And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is "particularly problematic" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here’s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Syria page to that point: If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively. Our ruling Huckabee said, "Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian." While the claim isn’t pulled out of thin air, it’s flawed. The statistic represents the three months before the actual influx of Syrian refugees, and the four out of five non-Syrians are not purporting to be Syrian. Rather, they came from war-torn countries. Overall, Syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 so far. We rate Huckabee’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-12262	"Sanctuary cities are extremely dangerous."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jul/08/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-radical-philly-extremely-dangerous/	The always controversial topic of sanctuary cities has come up yet again. This time, it was U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania discussing them during an invitation-only, televised "town hall" with eight constituents Wednesday. "Sanctuary cities are extremely dangerous," Toomey said. "Philadelphia is one of the most radical sanctuary cities in the country." Are they really "extremely dangerous?" PolitiFact Pennsylvania has tackled statements about sanctuary cities before from former Philly GOP chief Joe DeFelice, Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and even Toomey. Remember, sanctuary cities are essentially local jurisdictions that to some extent decline to either communicate with federal immigration officials or honor their detainer requests. This one’s a little different from the previous fact-checks but contains similar characteristics. We’ll start with Toomey’s explanation for the statement. His staffers said the senator believes sanctuary cities pose "real danger" and gave multiple examples of incidents in which immigrants ICE wanted detained were released and went on to commit violent crimes. These examples included the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco and Marilyn Pharis, a Southern California woman. They said sanctuary policies pose dangers in the same way loaded weapons are dangerous in the hands of a convicted criminal or someone who is mentally ill. Toomey’s staff had two officials affiliated with law enforcement send emails advocating for the Senator’s claim to PolitiFact Pennsylvania. We also reached out to the Center for Immigration Studies, which has been critical of sanctuary policies and has a motto of "low immigration, pro immigrant." Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, referred to her report tracking 8,000 people released despite ICE detainer requests and found about 25 percent of them went on to commit future crimes. "These are crimes that would have been prevented, at least in the United States," she said, "if the sanctuary policy had not interfered with ICE doing its job." Yet despite the anecdotes and Vaughan’s report, no conclusive study has shown higher crime rates as a result of a sanctuary city policy. In 2016, researchers from the University of California-Riverside and Highline College in Washington matched sanctuary cities versus those without any sanctuary policy and found the policies had no statistically significant effect on crime, meaning they didn’t lead to higher or lower crime rates. "This is something Trump was doing where they’re citing isolated examples of crimes as the norm for sanctuary cities," said Ben Gonzalez-O’Brien, a Highline College professor who worked on the study. "…Blaming it on the policies themselves isn’t really relevant. Sanctuary city policies don’t lead to more crime." The left-leaning Center for American Progress released a study showing counties with sanctuary policies had lower crimes rates than those that didn’t and also had stronger economies. In 2016, the first full year Philadelphia was a sanctuary city after Mayor Jim Kenney’s executive order, Philadelphia had its lowest property crime rate since 1971 and its lowest violent crime rate since 1979. "This notion that sanctuary cities are dangerous is really unfounded and politically motivated," said Lena Graber, a staff attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Our Ruling Pat Toomey said at a televised town hall, "Sanctuary cities are extremely dangerous." Despite several examples of crimes being committed by people ICE wanted detained but were released, no evidence has been produced to prove sanctuary cities are dangerous because of the policy. In fact, one study from last year showed sanctuary city policies have no statistically significant effect on crime. Neither Toomey, nor any study has shown sanctuary cities are measurably dangerous.

pomt-15382	"Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/jun/30/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-us-income-disparity-widest-1920s/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott voted against a sweeping trade in agreement with Asian nations earlier this month, in part because he thinks it will depress U.S. wages. "Entering into another large-scale trade deal at a time when income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s is not the best course of action for our nation," Scott said in a June 12 statement explaining his votes against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We wondered if pay inequality between the very top earners and the rest of workers really is the highest since the Roaring 20’s. Similar claims have been sounded this year from both sides of the political aisle and uttered by two presidential candidates who, otherwise, are light years apart: Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Scott’s office backed the claim by referring us to two reports. The first, published earlier this year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, is a guide to statistical studies on income inequality published by other organizations, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. All of the studies showed that disparity in the U.S. has been climbing steadily since the 1970s. But there was a problem: most of research didn’t go back much further in time and to get to the bottom of Scott’s claim, we had to travel back nearly 100 years. One such time machine exists and the second document referred directly to it. Research by Emmanuel Saez -- an economist at the University of California, Berkeley and recipient of a 2010 genius grant from the MacArthur Foundation -- traces U.S. pay disparity since 1913. Saez and other economists built a database that compiles historic disparity statistics from 30 nations using data from millions of individual tax returns filed over the years. In 2012, the top 1 percent of U.S. earners made 18.88 percent of the total pre-tax income of the nation’s tax filers. That was the highwater mark since 1928, when top earners pulled in a record 19.6 percent of all income. Saez says the 2012 share may have been a slight aberration, in part because many high earners cashed investments to avoid an increase in the capital gains tax that took effect the following year. In 2013, the top percent’s share of income was 17.54 percent of total earnings. While that was a slight decrease, it still was the 16th highest mark over the 101 years measured in data base. It’s also the latest year available. The data shows the top earners had at least a 16.68 percent share of total income every year since 2005. The figure was exceeded only one time between 1928 and 2005 -- top earners pulled in 17.64 percent in 1936.. The 16 years in which the top 1 percent had the greatest share of U.S. income are: 1928, 19.6 percent 2012, 18.88 percent 1927, 18.68 percent 1916, 18.57 percent 1929, 18.42 percent 2007, 18.33 percent 1914, 18.16 percent 2006, 18.06 percent 1926, 18.01 percent 1913, 17.96 percent 2008, 17.89 percent 2005, 17.68 percent 1936, 17.64 percent 1917, 17.6 percent 1925, 17.6 percent 2013, 17.54 percent. While Saez’s work has become a popular source for politicians to cite when discussing income disparity, some economists are critical of his measurements. Gary Burtless, an economist with Brookings, a Washington think tank, told us as well as PolitiFact Texas that Saez’s data understates income growth of the bottom 99 percent. He noted that Saez’s income data is limited to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains. What’s missing, Burtless said, are other forms of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. These unmeasured benefits, which almost entirely began in the 1940s -- and, in some cases, decades later -- "are far more important for low and middle-income Americans than they are for the very well-to-do," Burtless said. The CBO, which has been measuring income disparity since 1979, uses a broader statistical formula than Saez. It computed the top 1 percent’s income at 13.3 percent in 2009 and 14.9 percent in 2010 -- the latest years available. Saez, in comparison, computed the disparity at 16.7 percent and 17.5 percent for the same two years -- an average of about 3 percentage points higher than the CBO. Average income disparity during the 1930s was less than two percentage points below the average from 2010-2013. So if all forms of income were computed for each era, it’s possible that that the actual disparity was greater 1930s than it is today. Our ruling Scott said, "Income disparities in the United States are the worst since the 1920s." The one database that goes back that far backs up Scott. It shows that, with one exception, the sixteen highest years of disparity between the top one percent of earners and others occurred before 1930 or after 2004. But it’s worth noting that the data tends to understate income because it doesn’t consider major government and employee benefits that weren’t offered until the 1940s or later. So it’s very possible that bottom-line disparity would have been greater in the 1930s than it is today. For that reason, we rate Scott’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05255	Says Gov. Scott Walker "took away $1.6 billion from schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/31/we-are-wisconsin/recall-union-group-says-walker-cut-school-funding-/	Critics of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have condemned his funding cuts to schools and tax breaks for businesses and wealthier individuals. But did the education cuts fund the tax breaks? That’s what We Are Wisconsin, a labor unions group, claims in a piece mailed to voters ahead of the June 5, 2012, recall election. "Walker took away $1.6 billion from our schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich, causing layoffs of educators, crowded classrooms and less opportunity for our children," the mailer says. We’ve already rated statements about both figures. So we’ll look at those and then evaluate the connection the group is making. School cuts: We rated Mostly False a claim by state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, that Walker’s 2011-2013 budget cut public school funding by $1.6 billion. Some in and outside of state government use that figure. But experts told us that what the state budget actually saved on K-12 education, compared with the previous budget, was $800 million to $900 million. So, the group overstates its first figure, by about 100 percent. Tax breaks: We rated Half True a claim by the liberal One Wisconsin Now group that tax breaks approved for corporations and the rich would cost taxpayers $2.3 billion over a decade. The changes aren’t a cost to taxpayers in the normal sense, because the tax breaks mean less will be paid in taxes. (In other words: How can money not paid by taxpayers also cost taxpayers?) But we noted the changes will bring an estimated $2.3 billion less in revenue over a 10-year period, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper. We Are Wisconsin is mixing and matching numbers, however, giving a false impression to those who get the mailer. The school cuts figure is for the 2011-’13 budget while the tax breaks are measured over 10 years, which inflates their size. In the two-year budget, the tax breaks are projected to amount to about $212 million, according to the fiscal bureau. We asked We Are Wisconsin spokesman Kelly Steele if he had more evidence. He said the tax breaks reduced the amount of revenue available in the budget for education and other programs. We also asked for a response from Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews. She said school districts could have used "tools" in Walker’s budget, such as forcing employees to contribute more to their pensions, to offset the roughly $800 million cut in state aid. That’s not the issue at hand. But both Steele and Matthews make the same point in different ways, which is, budgeting is a dynamic process. Had the tax breaks that became law not been approved, it doesn’t necessarily mean more money would have gone to schools. It could have gone elsewhere. Our rating We Are Wisconsin said Walker took $1.6 billion from schools "and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich," suggesting a direct transfer of funds. But Walker’s school cuts amount to $800 million to $900 million over two years and the tax breaks amount to only $212 million during that period. Moreover, had there been no tax breaks, there’s no telling how that revenue might have been used. We rate We Are Wisconsin’s statement False.

"Mar-A-Lago Destroyed By Irma--Jared Kushner Still Missing," blares the headline from a website called "Freedumjunkshun." In fact, Kushner, a White House senior adviser, was seen on the South Lawn of the White House at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a day after Irma moved across the Florida peninsula. Attempts to contact the Trump Organization and Mar-a-Lago resort to inquire into any possible structural damage were unsuccessful. Multiple articles reveal that the Palm Beach resort and its surrounding area had been evacuated days before Irma reached Florida. Freedumjunkshun is a self-avowed fake news website that hopes to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its dim-witted satire for truth.

pomt-13135	Says that he’s responsible for Austin including Anderson Mill Road in the city's proposed transportation bond package.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/01/jimmy-flannigan/mostly-false-jimmy-flannigans-claim-hes-responsibl/	Community activist Jimmy Flannigan argues he has done more for Northwest Austin than his opponent to represent District 6 on the Austin City Council, incumbent Don Zimmerman. His case in point: Anderson Mill Road. Flannigan has repeatedly said at candidate forums and in interviews that he and his Northwest Austin Coalition deserve the credit for persuading Mayor Steve Adler to put $5.5 million for the notoriously traffic-jammed Anderson Mill Road in Austin’s proposed $720 million transportation bond. It’s one of more than 30 projects listed by name in the Nov. 8, 2016, ballot proposition. Flannigan told the online Austin Monitor, which focuses on local government news: "Anderson Mill Road was included in Mayor Adler’s transportation bond explicitly because of the work we did with the Northwest Austin Coalition." Monitor publisher Michael Kanin pressed during their exchange, posted Sept. 12, 2016 and later cited in an Oct. 21, 2016, Zimmerman press release: "Just to be crystal clear here, it was the mayor's office that told you it was because of your work..." Flannigan: "Yes." Kanin: "...And not (the work of) council member (Don) Zimmerman." Flannigan: "Yes." Flannigan made nearly identical claims at a Sept. 15, 2016, candidate forum organized by the City of Austin and the Austin-area League of Women Voters and a forum hosted a week later by the West Austin Chamber of Commerce. At those forums and in his Oct. 21 press release, Zimmerman called Flannigan’s assertions a lie. Zimmerman noted that he held a 2015 town hall meeting, attended by Flannigan and Adler, in which city staffers talked about potential solutions for Anderson Mill Road. Zimmerman’s statement also pointed out he proposed redirecting $2.2 million in transportation funding in August 2015 to study fixes for the road; that pitch did not draw council support. Zimmerman’s 2016 press release said: "Everyone in District 6 knows that Anderson Mill Road is a key artery that needs to be improved. Multiple groups have been working on fixing Anderson Mill Road." Building the bond So, how did various clogged roads end up in the proposed $720 million transportation bond? Adler, who first floated the idea of a big transportation bond plan in late 2015, took the lead on crafting the proposal. Three memos provided by Adler’s office and the city’s capital projects office offer insight. It looks to us like much of the ballot proposal drew from a June 13, 2016, Austin Transportation Department memo listing long-sought overhauls on seven major roads such as East Riverside Drive, North Lamar Boulevard and South Lamar Boulevard, in which engineering work was complete or underway. That memo also listed other critical stretches of roads, such as Anderson Mill Road between RM 620 and Parmer Lane. A second staff memo -- sent to Adler and the council on June 16, 2016 -- estimated it would cost $5.5 million to expand and improve a shorter stretch of Anderson Mill Road, between RM 620 and U.S. 183. The same day, Adler included the $5.5 million for Anderson Mill Road in his first public draft of possible bond projects. Five days later, city staff distributed a third memo, which also included Anderson Mill Road and estimated the size and scope of the work that could be done for different bond amounts. For example, that memo shows a $250 million bond would not include work on Anderson Mill Road, while a $720 million bond package would. Credit from the mayor? In the September Monitor interview, Flannigan said the "mayor’s office told" him that it was his work that got Anderson Mill in the bond. Just after the Monitor published the interview, though, Adler emailed his staff, asking: "Has anyone in our office made such a statement? Should someone call Jimmy and find out why he said that?" Zimmerman’s campaign initially provided a copy of that email, which we independently obtained and verified. By phone, Adler staff adviser John-Michael Cortez offered a different description of Flannigan’s role in getting Anderson Mill added to the bond. Cortez recalled Flannigan as "one of many people who highlighted specific (transportation) improvements in Northwest Austin." While Cortez said that he met with Flannigan and his group before the bond’s summer 2016 rollout, he added that Flannigan "not the only one who highlighted it as an important improvement." Cortez added: "I doubt I ever said it was because of his efforts, but his efforts certainly were helpful in making that project a priority." In an October 2016 phone interview with us, Adler took the same line. "These are conversations that have been going on in that community for years. Everyone was aware those conversations were going on," Adler said. "They were conversations that I heard when I was campaigning two years ago." Flannigan subsequently stood by his earlier statement that the mayor’s office had credited him with getting Anderson Mill into the bond. Asked to identify who in Adler’s office told him so, Flannigan didn’t say. By email, he responded: "At no point was I told that others had asked for the road to be included." Corridor study Flannigan has touted a "citizen-led" corridor study as one of the ways the Northwest Austin Coalition, which he founded, pushed to include Anderson Mill improvements in the bond. "When I brought that study to city staff and the mayor’s office, they got the road included in the bond," Flannigan said at the League of Women Voters forum. "That is a fact." A corridor study would be hard to miss. The typically binder-sized reports are full of painstaking schematics, diagrams and traffic projections that lay out proposed improvements and the effects they’ll have on neighborhoods and businesses. As an example, the December 2013 corridor study for East Riverside Drive runs 277 pages. When we inquired about an Anderson Mill corridor study, though, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford and a transportation department spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, each said by phone that city files didn’t show any study submitted by Flannigan’s group. When we emailed Flannigan’s campaign to ask for a copy, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, provided a link to an interactive map on the Northwest Austin Coalition’s website, where users could post complaints about the road. By email, Flannigan later acknowledged he hadn’t submitted the complaints or users’ suggestions to City Hall. "Since everything was public and online, it didn't require being sent," he wrote, "it was part of the public conversation." A city survey Flannigan also cited his group’s efforts to press for Anderson Mill improvements through the city’s 2015 transportation survey, MobilityATX, which asked residents for opinions on transportation needs online and during in-person public meetings. The top recommendation from the 1,039 Austinites who participated in the nonscientific MobilityATX survey: Building out the city's bike lane network, followed by burying Interstate 35 through downtown and expanding dedicated bus lanes. Tied for fourth, with 112 votes: Improving Anderson Mill Road between U.S. 183 and FM 620 and encouraging developers to build denser housing in central city neighborhoods. Cortez, Adler’s aide, suggested that Flannigan overplayed the importance of the 2015 survey to what made it into the bond package. "I think generally it played the role of getting people interested and excited about making some progress about our mobility challenges," Cortez said. "It just daylighted some priorities that some interested stakeholders had." Our ruling Flannigan said he’s responsible for Anderson Mill Road being part of the city’s proposed transportation bond issue. No doubt, Flannigan advocated for improvements to the road to be part of the 2016 bond proposal lately before Austin voters. Then again, Flannigan didn’t provide nor did we find independent indications that he himself caused the road to land on the ballot. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02616	Of the approximately 6 million disenfranchised felons in the United States, "one-quarter are Floridians."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/23/desmond-meade/one-quarter-disenfranchised-felons-live-florida/	A few days before the Martin Luther King holiday, voting rights activists held a protest in front of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Tampa office. Their goal: to make it easier for ex-felons (or "returning citizens") to regain the right to vote once they complete their sentence and leave prison. Voting access -- including restoring the rights of felons to vote -- could be a hot topic during the governor’s race this year. In 2011, Bondi, the newly elected Republican attorney general, spearheaded a move by the Florida Cabinet to make it more difficult for felons to regain the right to vote upon completion of their sentence. And in a Jan. 15, 2014, post on BloggingBlackMiami announcing the protest in Tampa, the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition called out the state for its record on disenfranchising ex-felons: "Of the approximately 6 million disfranchised citizens in the Unites States, one-quarter are Floridians," said Desmond Meade, one of the event organizers and President of FRRC. "Florida's disfranchisement rate is the highest in the country, more than 10 percent of the state's voting age population is disfranchised, and a shocking 23 percent of Florida's African-American population is disfranchised. Many of those who have lost voting and civil rights are men and women of God: preachers, pastors, deacons and apostles." ("Disfranchised" and "disenfranchised" mean the same thing -- we will use "disenfranchised" in our report.) We wondered whether Meade was correct that a quarter of disenfranchised Americans who were convicted of felonies are Floridians. Felon disenfranchisement in Florida "Felon disenfranchisement" refers to laws that restrict voting access for residents convicted of felonies. When voting rights activists talk about "disenfranchisement" more generally, that can also include other reasons citizens can’t vote, such as not being able to comply with voter ID laws. But we’re not looking at that broader category here, only at ex-felons. Scott and Charlie Crist -- Scott’s predecessor as governor, and now his opponent as he runs for a second term -- have clashed over the restoration of felon voting rights. (Scott is a Republican. Crist was elected as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat.) PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked a claim by Dan Gelber, a former state House Democratic leader from Miami Beach, who wrote on Crist’s campaign website that Crist, during his tenure as governor, "sought for and got approved the automatic restoration of felon rights for nonviolent offenders for the first time in Florida history (since reversed by Governor Scott)." We rated Gelber’s claim False because Gov. Reubin Askew pushed for similar reforms in 1975, and as a result of our fact-check Gelber added some information about Askew’s role. Still, it was correct that Crist did ease voting-rights restoration for some ex-felons, even if some advocates said the changes didn’t go far enough. Under the reforms Crist spearheaded in 2007, ex-offenders convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing, while those convicted of crimes such as murder would require a more thorough investigation and a hearing. The new rules enabled more than 150,000 restorations, though a backlog of 100,000 remained unsettled by the time Crist he left office, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In February 2011, Bondi argued that the process was too easy for released felons. So in March, the Cabinet scrapped the process and set a minimum five-year waiting period. Under those new rules, 954 ex-cons have had their rights restored through mid January. Felony disenfranchisement nationwide and in Florida The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition argues that Florida should automatically restore felons’ rights to vote upon completing most of the terms of their sentence. Meade, the president of the coalition, is an ex-felon convicted of cocaine possession and possession of a firearm in separate cases about a decade ago. He is now a law student at Florida International University on track to graduate in May. Meade said he applied to get his voting rights back in 2011 but was rejected. Meade’s claim stems from research by two sociology professors -- Christopher Uggen of the University of Minnesota and Jeff Manza of New York University -- who published the book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy in 2006. Nationwide, they found, approximately one out of 40 voting age Americans can’t vote due to a felony conviction. The numbers in each state vary because each state has different voting prohibition rules -- and Florida is among the most restrictive in the nation. Their most recent updated figures show 1.5 million disenfranchised Americans in Florida, as of December 2010, out of 5.85 million disenfranchised nationally. That’s roughly 25 percent. (The Sentencing Project, another advocacy group, used Uggen’s data to create a state-by-state map.) "In 2010, more people were disenfranchised in Florida than in any other state and Florida’s disenfranchisement rate remains the highest among the 50 states," Uggen wrote in a 2012 paper. We interviewed Uggen, who has been researching the numbers of disenfranchised citizens since the late 1990s. Uggen acknowledges in this paper that his numbers are partly based on estimates. "It is an estimate -- it’s not a head count," Uggen told PolitiFact. "We try to use reasonable and conservative assumptions in specifying in these models so we are not exaggerating the populations but the fact is the numbers mount pretty quickly in states that disenfranchise former felons." The straightforward part are the numbers of felons who are in prison now and those on probation or parole -- that comes from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The trickier part involves ex-offenders who finished their sentences -- that accounts for about 45 percent of his total, or about 2.6 million nationally. We should note that Uggen was an expert witness on behalf of plaintiffs who filed a federal class-action lawsuit against then-Gov. Jeb Bush, Crist’s Republican predecessor, that sought to overturn a voting ban for felons. However, we asked a spokeswoman for the Florida Parole Commission -- the entity that oversees restoring the right to vote -- whether the commission had any information to support or refute Uggen’s numbers. We received a one word answer: no. (A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections and Bondi’s office had referred us to the parole commission.) Our ruling Meade said that of the approximately 6 million disenfranchised felons in the United States, "one-quarter are Floridians." The numbers come from research done two professors, Uggen and Manza, who concluded that 5.85 million felons couldn’t vote nationally as of December 2010, including 1.5 million in Florida -- about a quarter. However, part of the researchers’ totals are based on an estimate of ex-cons who have completed their sentences but still can’t vote. We couldn’t find any alternative calculations, but different methods of estimation could reveal different figures. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05433	Says "I worked with our Mayor and other commissioners to help save the school year when a budget crisis in Salem threatened to cut four weeks of the school year," including negotiating with teachers to work for free.	false	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/27/charlie-hales/did-charlie-hales-help-negotiate-one-time-deal-por/	On the campaign trail, Portland mayoral candidate and former city commissioner Charlie Hales has been speaking up about what he’s done for schools -- but one of the claims has perplexed Portland teachers. In a campaign ad this month, a woman shows her support for Hales: "And when state budget cuts threatened four weeks of school, Charlie helped restore them, for every public school in Portland." That statement is repeated in The Oregonian’s Voter Guide, too. In a schools-related online post March 27, his campaign website has more details on how Hales saved the day: "He helped negotiate the city paying one time for two weeks of school, and the local teachers to work two weeks without pay." The statement about negotiating with teachers is repeated in a March 28 KATU questionnaire posted online: "I’m very proud that as a Portland City Commissioner, I worked with our Mayor and other commissioners to help save the school year when a budget crisis in Salem threatened to cut four weeks of the school year. I worked with our Mayor and school leaders to find emergency funds for half those days while negotiating with our local teachers to work half the days for free." PolitiFact Oregon gives an abundance of evidence so you know this isn’t a one-time claim by Hales, who faces chief rivals Eileen Brady and Jefferson Smith in the May 15 election. You should also know that Portland teachers’ union leaders say there’s been just one time in history when they worked for free -- and that was in 2003, when Hales was no longer on council. It was a huge deal. "That would be erroneous," said Ann Nice, former president of the Portland Association of Teachers, of Hales’ claim. "That was February 2003. It’s etched in my mind forever. I had to stand up to explain to 5,000 people why they should work for free." Hales left the council in June 2002 to take a job in the private sector. In January 2003, voters defeated a temporary statewide income tax increase and Portland Public Schools planned to cut 24 days of school. Before February was over, the county, city, teachers’ union and district had agreed to a contract that preserved those days. Teachers agreed to work 10 days of the 2002-03 school year without compensation, according to a tentative agreement signed Feb. 25, 2003. Mayor Vera Katz agreed to find money to pay for the remaining school days, and the city and county agreed to develop a longer-term funding package. Nice recalls meeting on the issue with Commissioner Randy Leonard -- Hales’ successor on council -- and with then-Commissioner Erik Sten. Rounding out talks were Commissioners Jim Francesconi and Dan Saltzman, and of course, Katz. Contacted by PolitiFact Oregon, Hales immediately owned up to the misstatement on Friday. He said he would issue a correction and pull the television ad from circulation. "I apologize for not being accurate," he said. "It appears that what happened is I merged in my mind the whole series of times when I voted in office to help schools with another later time when I was advocating for schools but out of office." We know what you’re thinking. How could Hales forget where he was? Right? In his defense, he and his campaign listed a number of votes he took in his decade on the City Council. We researched our in-house library and discovered that Portland Public Schools consistently needed help from the City Council -- which included Hales -- during the 1990s. For example, in 1999 the Oregon Legislature passed a budget that left Portland schools short $14 million. Nice, the former union leader, attests to Hales’ support while on council. "There were times when he was helpful with schools things and other times I know where the city helped the school district out, and he was helpful in those scenarios, but he wasn’t on City Council" when teachers agreed to work two weeks without pay, Nice said. Hales owned up to the inaccuracy of his statement. We give him and the campaign credit for being so quick to correct the record. But the statement is still flat wrong. We rule the statement False.

pomt-01692	Gov. Kitzhaber oversaw creation of the Oregon driver card law "behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2014/aug/13/protect-oregon-driver-licenses/was-oregon-law-giving-driver-cards-undocumented-ci/	With the general election less than three months away, a ballot measure that would overturn the Legislature’s vote to provide driver cards to those who can’t prove they are in the state legally is generating considerable heat. Almost as soon as Gov. John Kitzhaber signed Senate Bill 833 on May 1, 2013, a group opposing the measure mapped plans to gather enough signatures to refer it to voters. Protect Oregon Driver Licenses’ effort succeeded, and state voters will decide on Ballot Measure 88 in November. A yes vote would allow the law, whose implementation was suspended by the referendum effort, to take effect. The claim: Group members remain unhappy with the process, saying they were denied chances to participate in a 15-member work group convened by the governor before the original legislation was drafted. Among statements on Protect Oregon Driver Licenses’ website is this claim: Gov. John Kitzhaber formed a group to create SB 833 "behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest." PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We called Jim Ludwick, communications director for Oregonians for Immigration Reform -- the parent group of Protect Oregon Driver Licenses. Although the claim was made more than a year ago in April 2013, Ludwick said the group stands by it. He told us group members, hearing that the governor wanted a "special work force to draft legislation" to authorize driver cards, repeatedly asked the governor’s staff how they could take part. "We wanted a place at the table," Ludwick said. "We felt we should have a right to debate the issue." Only later, he said, did he and others learn a work group had already been appointed. "The whole thing was cooked and baked behind closed doors," Ludwick said. "We were strung along and excluded at every step." Legislative records show that four Democrats and four Republicans served as the bill’s primary sponsors. We emailed their offices for their take. Rep. Chris Harker, D-Beaverton, noted apparent confusion between the work group’s role and the actual drafting of the bill. Kitzhaber convened the 15-member work group, Harker said, to make policy recommendations around an Oregon driver card. Those recommendations, he said, were combined with information provided by Driver and Motor Vehicles Services and a bipartisan group of legislators to "inform the drafting of Senate Bill 833." The bill itself sailed through through two "very well attended public hearings," Harker said. He added that it was significantly amended once and had "input from more than 20 legislators." Harker said that the first hearing, held April 11, 2013, drew "so many participants they had to open three overflow rooms; hardly what I would call ‘behind closed doors.’" Members of Ludwick’s group, according to legislative records, were among those testifying. Rep. Vic Gilliam, a Republican from Silverton, was even more vociferous. "The unfounded protestations by this group and other similar groups has, for me, moved from disappointing to disgusting," he wrote in an email. "Claims that a bill moved through the Legislature, with committee and floor-sessions in both chambers, seems hardly to have been fashioned behind closed doors, without allowing any citizen input." The office of another co-sponsor, state Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland, said opponents shouldn’t have been caught off-guard by the 2013 effort since Shields introduced "a very similar bill" the prior session, in 2011. That bill, SB 845, died in committee but not before a public hearing. We then emailed the governor’s office, asking who participated in the work group and whether that process proceeded in accordance with Oregon’s public meetings law requirements. Spokeswoman Rachel Wray provided the list of participants, who represented a variety of public and private interests -- four current and retired chiefs of police; members of four Latino-affairs and advocacy organizations; a labor union representative; dairy, nursery, restaurant and winegrower representatives; someone from Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon; and a member of the governor’s staff. We consulted state statutes, which give the governor a green light to convene such groups, so long as they make only recommendations for his consideration. The ruling: The 2013 Oregon Legislature, in a bipartisan effort, approved a bill providing driver cards to those unable to prove they are in the country legally. After the governor signed the bill, a group opposing it quickly gathered enough signatures to refer SB 833 to the November ballot. However, members of the group, Protect Oregon Driver Licenses, claim they were shut out of a 15-member work group that made recommendations for how the bill should be drafted, and that the effort was fashioned "behind closed doors without allowing any input from citizens who represent the public interest." The work group, in accordance with Oregon public meeting law, met privately, giving some credence to the opponents’ claim of meeting "behind closed doors." While the work group did not include those who opposed the effort outright, it did include a wide spectrum of views, from chiefs of police to industries and individuals potentially affected by the bill. In addition, the bill that ultimately passed, after two well-attended public sessions, went through at least one significant amendment and other tweaks. Dozens of people, including the opposition, testified before the bill’s eventual passage, making it hard to argue that, as an opposition spokesman asserted, everything was "cooked and baked behind closed doors." The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Thoughts on this ruling?

pomt-12928	"I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/11/robert-astorino/astorino-has-not-raised-tax-levy-westchester-count/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants local governments to cut costs and share services to reduce burdensome property taxes for New York state residents. Cuomo unveiled a proposal in his State of the State speech for county leaders to craft an annual cost-cutting plan, which would be submitted to voters for approval. Westchester County Executive Robert P. Astorino took exception at Cuomo deflecting blame for property taxes. "I would remind the governor that I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years -- while Mr. Cuomo's state mandates have ravaged county, municipal and school budgets," Astorino said. Has Astorino kept the tax levy flat in Westchester County since taking office? Astorino’s budget Cuomo won a second term as governor in 2014 when he beat Astorino, the Republican nominee. Astorino has acknowledged he’s keeping the door open to another shot at Cuomo. As county executive of Westchester County, Astorino leads a county that has among the highest property taxes in the country. When Astorino started as county executive in 2010, the county collected about $560.7 million in property taxes from residents. In his first year, Astorino approved a $12.3 million, or two percent, cut in the county's real property tax levy. Since then Westchester County’s property tax levy has remained flat. So the county portion of residents’ property tax bill has decreased. Instead of just keeping the tax rate flat, Astorino and the county legislature opted to keep the dollar amount of the tax levy the same. Since more residents have moved into Westchester County in the past seven years, the property tax levy - now $548 million annually - has been spread out among more taxpayers. "With the tax levy frozen, county property taxes for residents in Westchester have actually gone down," said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center, an independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank in Albany. That does not necessarily mean a resident’s total property tax bill is lower. Their bill is comprised of county and local taxes, including school taxes. The sales tax rate in Westchester County has been 3 percent since 2004, according to the state Dept. of Taxation and Finance. Yonkers, the largest city in the county, was allowed by the legislature to raise its local sales tax in 2015. That decision was made by the city council and approved by the state legislature, not the county. The few other taxes the county collects, like the hotel occupancy tax, have also stayed at the same rate since Astorino was elected, the county’s press office says. Revenue from these taxes has increased since Astorino took office. Our ruling Astorino said "I have never once raised the county tax levy -- not for seven straight years." He’s right, according to the county’s budget department and the New York State Comptroller’s Office. He has proposed seven budgets, all of which either kept the tax levy flat or lowered it. We rate Astorino’s claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8d4a03aa-443d-4f46-a6b9-323e5ecb108b	None	Robert Astorino	None	None	None	2017-01-11T17:09:25	2017-01-10	['None']
pomt-02026	"Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/05/mike-hashimoto/texas-law-effectively-permits-long-rifles-be-toted/	Meanwhile in Texas, there’s been talk of gun-rights delegates to the state convention of the Republican Party of Texas strolling around its Fort Worth gathering place with long rifles in hand. Not so fast, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said in a news story posted online May 31, 2014. The story quoted city officials as saying those weapons could legally be toted outside the Fort Worth Convention Center but inside, "it’s a different matter because there’s a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission license. "State officials have been reminding Texans that any business with a state permit to serve alcohol may not knowingly let people carry long guns," the paper said. Broadly a few days later, Mike Hashimoto, an editorial columnist for the Dallas Morning News, took exception to Texans strolling around with rifles in a commentary, describing them as "chuckleheads strapping on their long rifles and marching into the local Chipotle or Chili’s or Home Depot. Whatever point they may have about gun-owner rights or Texas law they drown in look-at-me stupidity." Hashimoto kicked us into action with this factual claim: "Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas." Really? Up front, we recognized numerous news accounts have said the same, including a June 2, 2014, Austin American-Statesman story stating: "Texas law allows owners to openly carry rifles but not sidearms in most situations." Similarly, the National Rifle Association brought up what the law permits in a May 30, 2014, blog post questioning the "unneighborly" actions of individuals trying to make Second Amendment points by hauling rifles into coffee shops and restaurants. "Texas, independent-minded and liberty-loving place that it is, doesn't ban the carrying of loaded long guns in public, nor does it require a permit for this activity," the association said. Seeking statutory detail, we reached the legislative director of the Texas State Rifle Association, Alice Gene Tripp, who told us the Texas penal code restricts handguns, but it’s silent per toting long rifles and shotguns. Tripp pointed us to Section 46.02 of the code. By email, Hashimoto also singled out that section, saying it put limits on handguns, illegal knives and clubs, among specific weapons, not mentioning long rifles or shotguns. "From discussing this over the years with law enforcement officials, my understanding is that rifles and shotguns, therefore, were legal for open carry in Texas," Hashimoto said. "I've not questioned that understanding recently, as open-carry demonstrations have become more common, yet demonstrators, generally, have not been arrested for unlawfully carrying weapons." Section 46.02 states it’s at least a Class A misdemeanor if a person "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not on the person’s own premises or premises under the person’s control or in or directly en route to a motor vehicle"(including a recreational vehicle "or boat they own or control." Finally, we contacted Jerry Patterson, the state land commissioner who as a state senator authored the 1995 law enabling Texans to carry concealed handguns with state permits. By email, Patterson said: "Long gun ‘open carry’ has never been unlawful in Texas to my knowledge. How do you use a shotgun or rifle if you can't carry it openly?‎ Would you have to wrap it up if you placed it in your pickup gun rack?" Still, he pointed out out section 42.01 (a) (8) of the penal code, which states a person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly "displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm." Our ruling Hashimoto wrote: "Public display of a long rifle is perfectly legal in Texas." Texas law explicitly restricts handguns and some other weapons from being openly carried around. But the law is silent on long rifles. Generally, another provision says no one should display a firearm in a manner calculated to alarm. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-01267	"1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/nov/06/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-one-third-students-drop-out-or-arent/	With the 2014 elections in the rear-view mirror and 2016 coming up fast, the political world has begun speculating about whether former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- son of one president and brother of a second -- could seek the White House himself. In a recent fundraising letter sent on behalf of the Excellence in Education Foundation, Bush discusses one of his signature issues. "In order to have any lasting success, we must first transform our failing education system and have no tolerance for the adult-centered K-12 system that exists today. "America's education system is a prime example of government that is completely out-of-control. Instead of focusing on what's best for our children, education in America is focused on the adults who organize in more than 13,000 heavily unionized government monopolies. "As a result, America's high school graduation standards are shamefully low. "Only 25% of America's high school graduates are college or career ready. "1/3 of America's high school graduates need remediation. "1/3 of our kids drop out, cannot go to college or start a career. "This is a tragedy unfolding in our country in ways that will overwhelm us." This is a lot to chew on, but we decided to check one of these claims -- that one-third of American students "drop out, cannot go to college or start a career." The problem, we quickly found, is that Bush’s one-third figure isn’t correct for dropouts alone, for those who do not go to college, or for the combination of the two. Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency. One of the most common is the "status dropout rate," which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts. By this measure, Bush’s figure is significantly inflated. In 2012, 6.6 percent of 16-to-24-year-olds were neither enrolled in school nor possessed an alternative high school credential such as a GED. That’s one-fifth of Bush’s number. Another way of measuring dropouts is to use the "event dropout rate." This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. In 2011 -- the most recent year this statistic was calculated -- the percentage was 3 percent. That’s less than 10 percent of what Bush had said. So what’s going on here? When we asked Bush’s staff to explain their reasoning, they said that multiple reports show high numbers of minority students, black and Hispanic in particular, are not graduating from high school. It pointed to another federal estimate -- one that looks at how many public high school students who started as freshmen finished high school within four years. According to provisional data, the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate, as it is known, found that 78.2 percent of of freshmen finished school in four years. That figure was 66.1 for black students and 71.4 percent for Hispanics. That flip side would be that nearly 34 percent of black freshmen and about 29 percent of Hispanic freshmen didn’t graduate in four years. Education Week data showed similar numbers for members of the high school class of 2012. However, the fundraising letter doesn’t mention anything about minority students. So the most appropriate number to use would be the overall number -- and that would be 19 percent to 22 percent, depending on the parameters you use. Either way, that’s well below one-third. Bush’s staff also pointed to data from the publishers of the ACT college-entrance exam. It found that 31 percent of those who graduated from high school and took the ACT were not ready for entry-level college courses in English, reading, math or science. However, ACT test-takers represent a fraction all of students, and it’s not wise to assume they’re the same, said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. Overall, Bills said, the Bush camp’s justifications strike him as cherry-picking. "I think we’re getting a pretty motivated use of data," he said. Our ruling Bush said that "1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career." Traditional dropout figures peg the dropout rate at 3 percent to 6 percent, and even the most generous failure-to-graduate figures are running no higher than 22 percent for the U.S. population as a whole. The percentages are higher for African-American and Hispanic students, and at the most expansive level they can reach one-third. However, Bush’s claim said nothing limiting the statistic to minority students, so using this evidence to back up that claim is misleading. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. Clarification: The headline on this story has been changed to better reflect the statement we fact-checked.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2014-11-06T17:25:07	2014-10-27	['None']
pomt-11979	"The average tax bill for Americans in 2016 was a 41 percent increase from 2013."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/29/lamar-smith/did-taxes-go-41-percent-between-2013-and-2016/	As Congress prepared to debate a high-stakes tax bill, a reader asked us to check a letter about tax policy emailed by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. "A new report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in 2016 Americans spent more on taxes than they did on food and clothing combined," Smith wrote. "In fact, taxes were the second-largest expenditure of American families. The average tax bill for Americans in 2016 was a 41 percent increase from 2013." We zeroed in on the final assertion in that paragraph. Spread over a three-year period, a 41 percent bump in taxes would be significant. We found that even though Smith's factoid comes from a federal agency, it is a flawed comparison, and it fails to capture accompanying growth in income as well as other statistics that show the tax burden increased by a more modest amount. Backed by the bureau Smith’s office confirmed that the statistic comes from the most recent annual installment of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, which the BLS released in late August. The specific figure that Smith cited comes from this document. Average taxes paid, according to the survey, were $7,432 in 2013, but they rose to $10,489 in 2016. That’s a 41 percent increase, as Smith wrote. One important bit of context that’s missing: This figure ignores that average income increased over the same three-year period as well. Here’s a chart summarizing income, taxes and taxes as a percentage of income. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As the chart shows, a 17 percent rise in pre-tax income explains some of the increase in taxes paid. Taxes as a percentage of income rose by 20 percent. That’s about half the 41 percent increase Smith cited. In addition, the statistic Smith cited doesn’t communicate the reality that richer taxpayers saw a much bigger increase than taxpayers of more typical means. When broken down into quintiles -- the top one-fifth of earners, the second one-fifth and so on -- the increase from 2013 to 2016 was 29.1 percent for those in the middle quintile, compared to 44.6 percent for the fifth, or highest, income quintile. That said, the survey shows a substantial increase in taxes paid overall -- an increase well beyond the growth of income. There’s an important caveat, however: The BLS told us about a stumbling block in comparing 2013 and 2016 numbers. Basically, the bureau made a methodological change that results in an exaggerated increase in taxes paid during that time period. "There was definitely an increase, but the magnitude need to be interpreted carefully due to differences in how the (survey) measures taxes and income," Steven Henderson, chief of BLS’s division of consumer expenditure surveys, told PolitiFact. BLS changed its methodology in 2013, but the change was undertaken in a way that makes the 2013 figures for taxes paid lower than they were in subsequent years, Henderson said. The 2013 tax data is "lower and less reliable for comparison to later years," he said. "I interpret this to mean that it is inappropriate to compare calculated Consumer Expenditure Survey estimates of personal taxes in 2013 with the calculations for any later date," said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, of Henderson's explanation. Other data Is there an alternative way to assess how much taxes rose from 2013 to 2016? As it happens, there are at least two. One source is the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department. According to this data, taxes rose by 17 percent over the same three-year period, well below the 41 percent in Smith’s letter. And over that same period, income rose by 13 percent. This means that taxes did rise faster than income did, but only modestly. As a result, taxes as a percentage of income increased by only 3 percent between 2013 and 2016 (and the figure even fell slightly between 2015 and 2016). That’s quite a bit smaller than the 20 percent we found in the Consumer Expenditure Survey data. Here’s a summary of the Bureau of Economic Analysis data. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com A second data source is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We didn’t see income data in the CBO’s tables, but we did find the total amount of tax revenues generated for 2013 to 2016. And the percentage increase in tax revenues was essentially identical to what the Bureau of Economic Analysis found -- 17 percent -- and less than what Smith had written. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Some of the contradictions in the numbers are explained by the various collection methods. The Consumer Expenditure Survey is based on a survey of a sampling of Americans -- 28,000 interviews per year, along with approximately 7,000 more detailed interactions through voluntary diaries. The Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Congressional Budget Office, by contrast, measure actual, comprehensive data reported by the federal treasury. In addition, the tax data in the Consumer Expenditure Survey is estimated by BLS from the reported income totals rather than being reported directly by the household participating in the survey. This means that the survey data is less solid than the other measures, which count actual dollars received. And the Consumer Expenditure Survey offers an average, "typical" case, whereas the other two sources offer total amounts of income and taxes for the country as a whole. The big takeaway? There was an increase in taxes paid in the period Smith identified. But it isn't as big as 41 percent. Our ruling Smith wrote that "the average tax bill for Americans in 2016 was a 41 percent increase from 2013." Smith has accurately cited the results of the federal Consumer Expenditure Survey, even though he’s glossed over the simultaneous increases in income and the fact that increases for richer taxpayers drove that increase. However, the survey’s leadership acknowledged to PolitiFact that, for technical reasons, the 2013-to-2016 comparison is undercut by methodological differences. An alternative measurement using different federal data showed that taxes, after adjusting for income increases over the same period, rose by 3 percent. That’s an increase, but a more modest one.

pomt-09775	In a now-viral video, "impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey ... have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/25/michael-steele/gop-claims-video-shows-b-bernice-young-elementary-/	When we first saw a copy of the now-viral video of young school kids singing the praises of President Barack Obama on Sept. 24 ("Hooray, Mr. President, we honor your great plans/To make this country's economy No. 1 again!"), we looked at our watches to see how long it would take for Republican leaders to react. Turned out, not long. The following morning, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele sent out a blast e-mail with a link to the video and a plea for donations to the RNC to "fight this leftist propaganda and elect more Republicans this year and next." The issue also made the rounds on political radio and TV talk shows. Fox News' Sean Hannity and Kimberly Guilfoyle talked about whether Hannity's head would spontaneously combust or simply explode if his kid had been among those at the school. "That's not too creepy," Fox News host Glenn Beck said sarcastically on his Sept. 24 show after showing a clip of the video. "Did anybody in the room stop and think for a second, 'Wait a minute. I really wouldn't want my kids chanting a song about George W. Bush, so maybe I shouldn't do it with this one?'" By Friday, the number of people who had viewed the video neared half a million. In his e-mail, Steele said he was so stunned and outraged by the video, he felt the need to circulate it immediately. "In the video, impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than six or seven years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama,'" Steele wrote. "Friend, this is the type of propaganda you would see in Stalin's Russia or Kim Jong Il's North Korea. I never thought the day would come when I'd see it here in America." You can argue whether or not Steele laid the political rhetoric on a little too thick. The fact we wanted to check was the question that immediately popped into our head when we saw the video, "Did this really happen at a public school?" The short answer is yes. It happened at B. Bernice Young Elementary School in Burlington Township, N.J. That's a public school in the Burlington Township School District. In the video, about 18 second-graders are in an auditorium singing two songs about Obama. Here are some lyrics to the first song: "Mm, mmm, mmm! Barack Hussein Obama He said that all must lend a hand To make this country strong again Mmm, mmm, mm! Barack Hussein Obama He said we must be fair today Equal work means equal pay Mmm, mmm, mmm!" The second song is set to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic . "Hello, Mr. President we honor you today! For all your great accomplishments, we all doth say "hooray!" Hooray, Mr. President! You're number one! The first black American to lead this great nation! Hooray, Mr. President we honor your great plans To make this country's economy No. 1 again!" According to school district officials, the video was shot in February 2009 and was part of a program to recognize famous and accomplished African-Americans during Black History Month. "There was no intention to indoctrinate children," District Superintendent Christopher Manno said in a released statement. "There was no political agenda underlying the activity." The New Jersey Department of Education also responded via prepared statement. "The commissioner has directed the superintendent to conduct a thorough review of what happened to ensure students can celebrate the achievements of African-Americans during Black History Month without inappropriate partisan politics in the classroom, as well as ensuring the privacy of children is not violated," said Beth Auerswald, a spokeswoman for the district. "In addition, it is our understanding the teacher in question retired at the end of the last school year." It's unclear who wrote the lyrics or shot the video. In a note to parents and the media on Sept. 24, Superintendent Manno said "the recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized." Fox News reported that the video was originally posted on the Internet by Charisse Carney-Nunes, author of the children's book I Am Barack Obama. We sent an e-mail to the address on Carney-Nunes' Web site and received a response that, "At this time, Charisse has no comment for press." On Friday, Fox News caught up with a few parents in the drop-off line at B. Bernice Young Elementary School. Opinions varied about the appropriateness of the songs. Next stop Stalinist Russia? We'll leave that to parents, school officials and political pundits to argue about. We were checking Steele's comment that "impressionable youngsters at a public school in New Jersey, most of whom are no more than 6 or 7 years old, have been instructed to sing the praises of 'Barack Hussein Obama.'" Yes, they were second-graders, which makes them 7 or 8 years old, and therefore, "impressionable." And the video shows the teacher directing them to sing. Most importantly, this was at a public school. So we find Steele's claim to be True.	None	Michael Steele	None	None	None	2009-09-25T17:24:22	2009-09-25	['New_Jersey']
pomt-03886	Says Gov. Rick Scott cut more government jobs than were created in the private sector in Florida in 2012.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-rick-scott-cut-more-jobs-cre/	On the eve of Gov. Rick Scott’s third State of the State address, Florida Democrats released a lengthy memo detailing setbacks for job creation under his reign. "After cutting more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012, failing to keep his promise to create 700,000 new jobs and a disastrous election year where the Florida GOP ‘got their teeth kicked in,’ Gov. Rick Scott is running away from everything he campaigned on to get re-elected," wrote Scott Arceneaux, the party’s executive director, in the March 4 memo. His memo served up plenty of talking points for Democratic lawmakers at a press conference berating Scott’s policies later that day. "Scott cut more jobs than he created in 2012, and the jobs he created aren’t high-quality, high-paying positions of the future," said Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando. PolitiFact Florida is monitoring the central promise of Scott’s 2010 campaign -- creating 700,000 jobs over seven years -- on the Scott-O-Meter, where it is rated Stalled.The state has experienced positive job growth since Scott took office in January 2011, but not at the rate that he would need to meet his pledge. With that in mind, the Democrats’ claim that Scott cut "more jobs than he created" sounded like it needed another look. We should note first that it's not right to give Scott credit (or blame) for all job growth (or losses) that happens while he is governor. Economic experts have told us that governors usually have little influence on short-term economic performance in their states. Often, national trends and general economic circumstances overwhelm the actions of a single governor. On the other hand, public officials do have control over the size of the state workforce, and Scott made no secret of his desire to shrink the state payroll during his campaign. He said he would cut state jobs by 5 percent, a pledge we rated Promise Kept on the Scott-O-Meter. But did he weed out state worker jobs at such a rate that it overtook private sector growth? Put simply, no. In his memo, Arceneaux zeroed in on private vs. state government jobs in 2012. "Since the beginning of 2012, Florida has added 7,800 private-sector jobs, but has cut 9,600 public sector jobs," he states in the memo, which offers an August 2012 report from the state’s Department of Economic Opportunity as back-up. We noticed one problem right away. Arceneaux claims to make an overarching point about job losses exceeding gains for all of 2012. But the supporting evidence deals with federal labor data available through mid-August, accounting for just half of the year’s jobs picture. We asked Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad to explain. He sent us a 2012 news story from the Orlando Sentinel, which quoted Rollins College economics professor William Seyfried as saying Florida added about 7,800 private-sector jobs while cutting about 9,600 government positions -- this is key --so far that year. Conrad said this was the most recent report the party had. We found data for Florida jobs for all of 2012 from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yes, 2012 was not kind to the state’s job market for the first half, Seyfried told us by phone. But federal data show it picked up after August. From December 2011 to December 2012, Florida lost 10,600 total government jobs. On the other hand, the state saw an increase of 65,600 private-sector jobs. Put them together and you get an overall nonfarm jobs total of 54,900 jobs -- a net gain, which belies Arceneaux’s point. "There’s no way one can conclude that Florida experienced a net loss of jobs in 2012," Seyfried said. Florida's 2012 economic performance mirrored the country's underwhelming job growth, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "They pick six months (of Florida jobs data) and they say nothing about the role the Democratic president has played in a slow national recovery," Snaith said. Arceneaux’s point is focused on the worst period of job growth the state experienced with Scott as governor. The state grew more than twice as many jobs in Scott’s first year in office (122,900 private-sector jobs - 7,200 government jobs = 115,700 total nonfarm jobs). And by the end of 2012, Scott’s job creation total continued to lag mightily behind his promise of 700,000 jobs but was up to 170,600. Our ruling Scott Arceneaux, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, tried to discredit Scott’s influence on Florida’s economy on the eve of his State of the State address. Putting the blame for job losses squarely on Scott’s shoulders, Arceneaux said Scott cut "more jobs than he created in Florida in 2012." This claim is a bad case of cherry-picking. The Democrats honed in on the state’s bleakest period of job growth. Not only that, they held it up as a whole year’s performance. Yeah, 2012 was sluggish for job growth, especially compared to 2011. But it was an increase nonetheless. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-03-05T16:32:57	2013-03-04	['None']
pomt-03728	"In 2012, 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards" and are "failing" the children they serve.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/14/robin-vos/wisconsin-assembly-speaker-robin-vos-says-1-4-scho/	Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) ignited fierce Democratic reaction when he contended that widespread failings by Wisconsin public schools were a rationale for endorsing Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to expand private-school choice. "In 2012, 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards," Vos said in an April 5, 2013, video news release. "Simply, those schools are failing the Wisconsin children they serve." Within hours, state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains) fired back: "Saying that one in four public schools is receiving a subpar score on the school report cards is a gross misrepresentation of the truth," Pope said in a press release. "If we are going to have an honest discussion about increasing the performance of all types of Wisconsin schools, we cannot continue to tolerate this type of intellectual dishonesty." Turn away, children, the grown-ups are fighting again. Isn’t it the parents and kids who are supposed to spar when the report cards come home? Let’s pull out those report cards and take a look. Did 25 percent of schools get a subpar -- below average -- score that indicates they are "failing" their students, as Vos claimed? The report cards, first produced in October 2012, were the product of a bipartisan task force. Three Republicans -- Walker and the two top legislative leaders -- plus State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers co-chaired a group that included teachers, school leaders, researchers, advocates, and legislators from both parties. The group voted against an A to F scale for the report cards and left the design of the rating scale to the Department of Public Instruction. Walker had advocated an A to F scale in the 2010 campaign, but nonetheless applauded the compromise package of accountability measures. Under the system, schools were evaluated on test scores and test-taking participation, graduation rates, attendance and graduation rates and closing performance gaps between various student groups. About 210 schools were not rated mainly because information was lacking or the schools were too new or small. Here is the scale, and how 1,908 public schools came out : Significantly Exceeds Expectations: 66 schools (3.5 percent). Based on combined score of 83 -100. Exceeds Expectations: 643 schools (33.7 percent). Scores of 73 - 82.9. Meets Expectations: 926 schools (48.5 percent). Scores of 63 - 72.9. Meets Few Expectations: 197 schools (10.3 percent). Scores of 53 - 62.9. Fails to Meet Expectations: 76 schools (4.0 percent). Scores of 0 - 52.9. An Oct. 22, 2012, Associated Press story on the cards described the results this way: "Most Wisconsin schools meet or exceed expectations as defined on new, more stringent report cards ... More than 85 percent of schools meet or exceed expectations." The Journal Sentinel said that of schools rated, 86 percent met or exceeded the state's expectations for performance, noting: "About 14% of the schools rated...fell below the state's expectations for performance." So the report card says one in 10 schools are meeting "few" expectations, and one in 25 are simply failing to meet expectations -- for a combined total of 14 percent or one in seven below the "meets expectations" level. With that statistical backdrop, how does Vos come up with 25 percent (his one in four) that are "subpar" and "failing" in their mission? When asked about the claim, Vos aide Kit Beyer told us her boss was choosing to view the scores in the report card as a parent would -- as an A-to-F proposition. That is, Vos takes the total score for a school and compares it to the traditional letter-grade scale. In his view, a score of 66 percent or below is barely passing on the traditional report card, and therefore the 23 percent of schools that scored at or below that level are "subpar" and "failing" students. Vos rounded 23 percent to "one in four." Beyer acknowledged that the state report card "uses a different grading scale" than the traditional report card, but said Vos "believes the grading scale used on these report cards make it seem like more schools are doing okay." But there’s a major problem with Vos’ approach. In his statement, Vos specifically cited "the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards." And the department has noted the scale is not constructed as a traditional A-to-F scale. The only similarity is it has five categories. In a November 2012 item, PolitiFact Wisconsin noted the department’s warning on this was explicit. "It’s important to note that the 0 to 100 accountability index score is not a "percent correct" measurement, so the scores are not the same as grades," the state Department of Public Instruction warned when the grades came out. That was one reason we rated it a Compromise on the Walk-O-Meter. Department of Public Instruction spokesman John Johnson reiterated that the state’s card was not set up to correspond with a traditional letter-grade scale. "It make senses to avoid conflating these two different types of measures and these different ways of understanding results," he said. A task force member, Miles Turner, executive director of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators, said that trying to convert the report card scores to letter grades was "like using a thermometer to weigh something. The tool doesn’t measure that." Of note: Walker’s choice expansion (which Vos supports) would be based on 2013 report cards as written, not as Vos re-envisions them. Walker has proposed that districts with at least two schools in the bottom two categories in the report card are "underperforming" and should be opened to choice competition. Those are the categories that contain 14 percent of schools. Walker has sometimes used the term "D" and "F" schools to describe some schools in the report card. But -- unlike Vos -- Walker’s "D" and "F" schools are the bottom two categories that contain 14 percent of the state’s public schools. He sticks to the report card’s numerical system. Our rating Advocating expansion of school choice into more cities, Vos said: "In 2012, 1 in 4 Wisconsin schools had a subpar score on the Department of Public Instruction’s recent report cards" and are "failing" the children they serve Vos is entitled to his viewpoints on how many schools are substandard and on how the report card was set up. But he clearly references the department’s report cards -- and then wrongly quotes them as saying they show one in four public schools are not only "subpar" but "failing" their students. The report card does not make either one of those claims, doesn’t use that language and, it’s architects say, can’t be converted to grades. In fact, the report card says about one in seven schools are not meeting expectations. Vos is way off base in the way he tries to turn up the heat on public schools to push choice. That lands him on the fiery red end of the Truth-O-Meter. Pants on Fire.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2013-04-14T09:00:00	2013-04-05	['Wisconsin']
pomt-14511	With Obamacare, "You have no options .. you can't get competitive bidding."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/21/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-obamacare-has-no-options-compet/	Donald Trump vows he’ll do away with Obamacare. He calls it a "disaster" and says "it’s going to be repealed. It’s going to be replaced." But beyond that, it can be hard to tell what Trump would actually do. "We're going to have great plans, they're going to be a lot less expensive than Obamacare," Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press. "They're going to be private. And there are going to be lots of ... We're going to have a lot of different options. Right now, you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controls (President Barack) Obama, because they gave him a lot of money. That's why you have lines around the states. And you can't get competitive bidding." Trump was referring to the Republican idea of allowing insurance companies to sell in multiple states in one fell swoop, rather than through the state-by-state permitting process that happens today. Trump also believes in health savings accounts and some sort of program for the very poor. When NBC host Chuck Todd asked him about his view on mandates, Trump said no one would be forced to buy health insurance, unlike the law says today. But we were struck by his statement that "right now, you have no options." We reached out to the Trump campaign to learn what he specifically meant and did not hear back. Trump’s comments seemed misleading because a major part of the health care law is set up to encourage competition and give people options. Does the law achieve that? The short answer is, for most people it does. However, in more rural counties, residents might have to choose between only one or perhaps two insurance companies. Those people have few options. The exchanges The new health care law sets up exchanges or marketplaces, primarily online but also accessible through various government offices, where people can pick from roughly comparable insurance plans for which the main difference is price. The law puts each plan into one of four tiers -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum. The more generous, and costly, the plan, the higher the tier. The government’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that for 2016, about two-thirds of the counties have three or more insurers offering plans at the silver level. (This only has to do with plans on the exchanges, and primarily the exchange run by Washington. Employer-provided insurance is altogether separate.) A more detailed analysis for 2016 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data, found wide variation across the country. In Indiana, for example, residents in every county have at least four carriers to choose from. In contrast, in Oklahoma, no county has more than two companies competing with each other. Out of about 2,600 counties in the Kaiser study, 10 percent, or about 260, have just one insurance company offering any policies. As the table above shows, while people in most counties can choose from among three or more insurers, the change from 2015 to 2016 is toward less competition, not more. "There are a lot of things to criticize about the Affordable Care Act -- too rigid and regulated in terms of the benefits that must be offered, etc. -- but most exchanges have several options available and some have many options," said Gail Wilensky, who headed the Medicare program during the George H.W. Bush administration and now is a health care analyst with Project Hope. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 9 out of 10 returning customers using the national exchange, healthcare.gov, were able to choose from among at least three companies. The Kaiser Family Foundation noted that the lack of competition is greatest in rural communities. The higher the percentage of rural residents, the lower the number of insurers. "There are fewer potential enrollees to attract insurers and also fewer health care providers with whom they can contract," the report said. Robert Laszewski, a private analyst with Health Policy and Strategy Associates, offered a different interpretation of Trump’s words. Laszewski said Trump could have meant that for lower-middle income people, none of the plans are actually affordable. "These policies have come to be very expensive both in terms of premiums and deductibles," Laszewski said. "In that sense the choices are very limited." It is also worth noting that because rural counties have fewer people, the fraction of the population that faces no real choice is less than than the fraction of counties where that is a problem. Most Americans live in urban areas where insurance competition is more robust. Our ruling Trump said that under Obamacare, "you have no options," for health insurance plans. That is true in about 10 percent of the counties where individuals buy their coverage on the government’s insurance exchange. In another 30 percent of counties, people have only two companies to choose between. But the people living in about 60 percent of the rest of the counties have at least three insurance providers to compare. There’s an element of truth in Trump’s words, but his statement leaves out a lot of information that would leave a different impression. We rate this assertion Mostly False.

pomt-08157	Says he got twice as much money from the sale of County Grounds land than Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker was willing to accept.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/03/lee-holloway/lee-holloway-says-he-got-more-twice-much-money-cou/	In his first interview since Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker was elected governor, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway didn’t mince many words. With Walker soon to depart, giving Holloway a chance to serve as interim county executive, the chairman held forth on a variety of topics -- describing the ideal person as having the qualities of, well, Lee Holloway. Here’s a sample of an exchange between Holloway and the weekly Shepherd Express newspaper, which published the account in its Nov. 17, 2010 edition. Shepherd: Regarding the candidates for county executive, what sort of person would be the best for the job? What type of person does the county need? Holloway: I think it needs a person like Lee Holloway, to be honest with you. I’m sincere about that. I think I’ve got all of the skills and the ability. And the big initiatives all came from me, for a long time: the health (insurance) initiatives, which saved $100 million for the county; the pension obligation bonds — he (Scott Walker) couldn’t get the votes; the sales tax. I tried to save Midwest Express, and did everything I could. He couldn’t get the votes for that. I created the GAMP program, which lasted for 16 to 18 years, and it became a national model. The UWM (expansion), that’s my deal. He was talking about $6 million; I came up with $13 million. Those are a lot of big projects. He’ll come up and try to get publicity and say, ‘Me and Chairman Holloway…’ And he doesn’t veto my stuff. " That’s a lot of boasting from the effusive chairman, who has not ruled out appointing himself interim executive. We decided to take a closer look at the comment about the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee project, which relates to land the UWM Foundation purchased to construct its Innovation Park campus on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa. The foundation’s first payment of $5 million is due Dec. 15, 2010. So, did Holloway really drive a harder bargain than Walker, getting $7 million more for the county and its taxpayers? The project has been under discussion for several years, and has also included land division, a development plan, rezoning and creation of a tax incremental financing district from the city of Wauwatosa. In the case of the land deal, the county and UWM Foundation have an agreement for purchase of the 88-acre tract, located east of U.S. Highway 45 and north of W. Watertown Plank Road for $13.55 million. When talks began, each side came to the table with its own outside appraisal of the land’s value. UWM’s was for about $8 million; the county’s came in at $13 million Holloway was involved in crafting the county’s response for the next level of negotiations, moving UWM closer to -- and possibly above -- the county figure, according county and UWM Foundation staff involved in the talks. Holloway pushed for the county to use a formula that took into account the future value of the parcel, once it was fully developed, said Craig Dillman, the county’s manager of real estate services. The formula, called a floor to area ratio, is commonly used in real estate development. Holloway argued the development could be more dense than the UWM projections. "That’s how the higher value came to be achieved," Dillman said. The two sides eventually agreed not only on a price of $13.55 million -- but also on a formula that calls for future payments to the county if UWM’s development exceeds projections. What did others say about Holloway’s role? UWM Foundation President David Gilbert said he didn’t know the extent of Holloway’s involvement in the county side of the talks. He said Holloway was one of several players. "The main person we negotiated with was Craig Dillman," Gilbert said. Walker Chief of Staff Tom Nardelli said Holloway was trying to take credit for something that was a group effort on the county’s part. "Holloway always believed he could get more" for the land, Nardelli said. "If Scott said five, he’d say go to six." In his claim, Holloway argues the county -- as in Walker -- was ready to settle for $6 million. But no one we talked with recalls that figure ever coming up -- after all, UWM’s appraisal was for $8.5 million. And no one associated that figure with Walker, who Holloway claims was ready to accept it. Indeed, Walker was not at the table himself -- Dillman was there. We asked Holloway for an interview several times. He didn’t respond. County Board spokesman Harold Mester said Holloway recalls that the $6 million figure was "discussed behind the scenes" by UWM and county negotiators, before the first offer was presented by UWM. "The County Executive was ready to sell that land at a lower price," Mester said. "The chairman said ‘Wait a minute. This is one of the most valuable land parcels we have, at the crossroads of the state of Wisconsin.’ The chairman thought there was a lot more value there." Said Mester: "The chairman takes credit for getting more money for the taxpayers and that’s what’s important." Nardelli responded: "That was all being negotiated. Scott never wanted less. It’s assinine to suggest that." Let’s score this one out. Holloway bragged he got $7 million more for taxpayers than Walker was willing to accept from the UWM Foundation. From all accounts, Holloway was involved in the talks, and pushed for the formula that was ultimately used and the final price tag was about $5 million more than UWM’s initial appraisal. So some him credit for the higher price. But there’s no concrete evidence that Walker was willing to simply accept the UWM appraisal -- and certainly none that he wanted to go $2.5 million lower. That wouldn’t be much negotiating at all. We rate Holloway’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Lee Holloway	None	None	None	2010-12-03T09:00:00	2010-11-17	['Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin']
pomt-08902	"Tim Pawlenty has cut education funding in Minnesota. Classrooms are overcrowded. Districts have gone to four-day school weeks."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/mark-dayton/mark-dayton-says-gov-tim-pawlenty-cut-education-sp/	Minnesota governor and potential Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty's decision not to run for re-election this fall sparked a contentious gubernatorial battle in the North Star State. With the Aug. 10 primaries nearing, the candidates took their attacks to the airwaves. Still facing opponents in his own party primary, Democratic-Farmer-Labor frontrunner Mark Dayton started swinging at Republicans in a television ad criticizing Pawlenty's education policies. Behind sunny images of children in classrooms and on school buses, smiling or talking with Dayton, a voice intones, "Tim Pawlenty has cut education funding in Minnesota. Classrooms are overcrowded. Districts have gone to four-day school weeks." A quick study of a Department of Education survey showed that Minnesota's elementary and secondary classrooms are more crowded than classrooms in at least two-thirds of other states. The state's average class size is also significantly larger than the national average. It was also easy to verify Dayton’s claim that school districts have gone to four-day weeks. At least 10 districts have had four-day schedules for at least a year, and another two are considering such a switch. Most superintendents cite a tighter state budget as the catalyst for the new schedule. In the ad’s most provocative claim, Dayton asserted that "Pawlenty cut funding by $1,300 a student." The state’s Price of Government report shows that the state budgeted just under $6.1 billion for schools in fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2011, the state has allocated more than $6.9 billion -- an apparent increase of almost a billion dollars. The Pawlenty administration's strict insistence on budget cuts makes that increase particularly noteworthy. But don’t close those schoolbooks just yet. Dayton’s campaign staff said his $1,300 figure came from research by Jeff Van Wychen, of the progressive think tank Minnesota 2020. We took a look at his calculations for ourselves. When education expenditures are adjusted for inflation, as Van Wychen and experts say they should be, the dollars schools received in 2011 are worth less than the amount received in 2003. Adjusted for inflation, Minnesota's 2003 school funding amounts to about $8 billion -- over $1 billion more than the $6.9 billion allocated for fiscal year 2011. Divided by Minnesota Department of Education attendance figures, per-student funding fell $1,300 -- from $9,700 to $8,400 between 2003 and 2011. An important caveat: Van Wychen's calculations use a figure called a "price deflator for state and local government purchases" to adjust for inflation. He argues that it is superior to the Consumer Price Index, a more commonly used adjustment index, because the CPI takes into account many goods that governments never buy, and Minnesota State Economist Thomas Stinson agrees. The price deflator for state and local purchases that he uses is legislatively codified as the appropriate measure of inflation for education funding in Minnesota, according to Dayton's office. So Dayton’s $1,300 figure is correct, when inflation is taken into account. But Dayton’s claim that Pawlenty cut education funding is misleading. In non-inflation-adjusted dollars, education funding increased -- though perhaps not quickly enough to keep up with the cost of education in Minnesota. While the schools' actual purchasing power decreased over those seven years, their budgets were not cut. "You get into a lot of semantic games when you’re talking about [budget] cuts and cuts in real spending power. While [Pawlenty's budget] is not a cut in spending, it is a cut in the level of service available," said Stinson. In fact, in 2009 Pawlenty used stimulus funds to reverse initial budget cuts to K-12 education, and he unexpectedly promised to preserve education when he cut spending in nearly every other area in 2010. All in all, the research backing Dayton up is solid -- although some might argue with the methodology. For those who believe that failure to keep up with inflation is a budget cut, Dayton's arguments are persuasive. But his allegation that Pawlenty cut education funding is complicated by the fact that actual dollars went up while Pawlenty was in office. We’ll rate this one Half True.

pomt-03348	Food stamp spending "doubled under President Bush, doubled again under President Obama."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/19/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-says-food-stamp-spending-doubled-unde/	Food stamp spending doubled under President Barack Obama — after doubling under his Republican predecessor, says Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. That’s one reason he’s disappointed that House lawmakers missed a chance to push for more than $20 billion in savings over 10 years when they stripped nutrition programs from the farm bill. Now they may be stuck with current law or the Senate bill, he said, which aims to trim about $4 billion. "I would argue what we missed, as Republicans, was the chance for real reform," he said in an MSNBC interview July 16, 2013. "We could have gotten some reductions. It's a program that's doubled under President (George W.) Bush, doubled again under President Obama. So, you know, program this big, there's some things you can do differently and still help people that need it." We wondered: Did such spending double under Bush, then double again? SNAP growth We’ll start by noting that food stamps have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008. It’s the federal government’s largest food program, eclipsing other big farm-bill food spending for school lunches and breakfasts and for Women, Infants and Children. It helps low-income people buy groceries, usually with benefit cards that work like debit cards. The 2007-09 recession drove the number of folks on food stamps to a record high under Obama. In an average month in 2011, one in seven U.S. residents got help. A Washington Post reporter this year documented one Rhode Island town’s reliance on its monthly SNAP infusion. We asked Cole for his evidence that spending doubled under Bush before doubling under Obama. The congressman provided numbers from the agency that administers the program, the U.S. Agriculture Department. He compared total costs of the program from the start of Bush’s term in 2000 to the end of his second term in 2008, then growth from 2008 to the most recent fiscal year available, 2012. Costs had more than doubled under Bush, from $17 billion to $38 billion, then doubled again under Obama, to $78 billion. Cole didn’t adjust for inflation, but he should have: A more accurate inflation-adjusted measure even more closely matches his claim. Total spending on SNAP in 2012 dollars doubled under Bush, from $20 billion to $40 billion, and very nearly doubled under Obama, $40 billion to $78 billion. Why? The story since 2007 is still fresh: joblessness driven by the recession made more people eligible for help, and also drove more folks who were already eligible for help to ask for it, perhaps because their other support networks were tapped out. The stimulus bill also included a boost in benefits, which temporarily increased costs. That expires in November. The recession also partly explains the rise in benefits before Bush left office in 2008. But it was the presidency of Bill Clinton and the 1996 welfare reform that set the stage for rising benefits under Bush. Under Clinton, spending had fallen nearly 40 percent, partly because of new limits in the law. By the late 1990s, lawmakers were already starting to roll back some restrictions, according to the Congressional Budget Office. "The increases were largely a rebound from the deep cuts the program sustained in the 1996 welfare law and strengthening the program’s ability to support working families," said Dottie Rosenbaum, who worked in the Congressional Budget Office at the time. She’s now a senior policy analyst with the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Ron Haskins, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Bush on welfare policy at the time of the 2002 farm bill, said the goal then was to expand food programs for low-income working families. The bill made it easier for states to administer the programs and to get more eligible people signed up. "If they're willing to work for 9 or 10 bucks an hour, and get our kids out of poverty, then we ought to help them," he said. He said he’s concerned by the increase in spending on food stamps, and has testified before Congress on ways to reduce it, including requiring more evidence for families to claim deductions that help them qualify for benefits. Rosenbaum argues no change is required. Spending will come down on its own as the economy recovers. About 65 percent of the growth in spending from 2007 to 2011 was driven by an increase in the number of people eligible for food stamps in the poor economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office. About 20 percent of growth came from the temporarily higher benefits under the stimulus bill. In other words, the economy by itself will bring food stamp spending down. "The more recent growth is driven primarily by the recession and is evidence that SNAP is doing precisely what it is designed to do: quickly help more low-income families during economic downturns as poverty rises, unemployment mounts, and more people need assistance," she said. Our ruling Cole said food stamp spending "doubled under President Bush, doubled again under President Obama." Agriculture Department numbers back his claim. Whether that’s evidence the program requires reform depends on your perspective on government assistance. Even with no change in the law, spending will fall as the economy recovers. Cole got his history right. We rate his claim True.	None	Tom Cole	None	None	None	2013-07-19T11:46:09	2013-07-16	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-03739	"The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before. We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/11/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-corzine-other-administration/	New Jersey’s fiscal history is not going to repeat itself, if Chris Christie has anything to say about it. In particular, that means no more raiding the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund to plug budget holes – a practice he alleges occurred during the Corzine and other administrations. "The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before," Christie said on the March 25 ‘Ask the Governor’ radio program on NJ 101.5-FM. "We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it." There’s a degree of accuracy to what the governor said but for this fact check, it’s equally important to look at what he didn’t say. First, some background on the state’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Payroll taxes paid by employees and employers comprise the fund. That money is used to build up reserves in good economic times so unemployment benefits can be paid during economic downturns. The fund pays unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey. But that’s not what happened, especially after both parties spent years diverting fund money to cover charity care payments to hospitals, ultimately reaching $4.6 billion by 2005. Then the recession hit and unemployment claims started pouring in around 2008. The fund was near empty by March 2009 and New Jersey had to borrow more than $1 billion from the federal government to cover expenses. That loan is on track to be repaid by March 2014, said Frank W. Haines III, assistant legislative budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. About a year ago, state Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) claimed an "unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton" was largely responsible for the frequent fund diversions, but PolitiFact New Jersey ruled that claim Mostly False. While both political parties were responsible for diversions, the OLS told us that about 67 percent of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds resulted from legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature between 1992 and 1997. So where does Corzine come in? Despite Christie’s claim, Corzine was the first governor in years to stop diverting money from the fund. But he authorized a $260 million payment into the fund so claims could be paid, as well as borrowing from the federal government. Money from the fund has not been diverted since fiscal year 2006, which was actually calendar year 2005, Haines explained. The governor at that time was Richard Codey, not Corzine. Codey served 10 months as interim governor after Democrat Jim McGreevey resigned. Corzine became governor in January 2006. So Christie is wrong to pin diversions on Corzine, but Corzine still bears some blame, said Michael Drewniak, a Christie spokesman. "The Governor has said many times that both parties were guilty of raiding the UI fund; Governor Corzine’s borrowing extended and compounded the problem," Drewniak said in an e-mail, noting that Christie was speaking colloquially when he used the word ‘stealing.’ "There’s been other equal opportunity failures too, pension underfunding comes immediately to mind. The Governor has always said there’s plenty of blame to go around for prior fiscal mismanagement, but he also always emphasizes the need for bipartisanship to fix all those things that set us back." Drewniak also noted that Christie said of the fund’s diversions, "We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it." That’s probably because the governor supported a ballot question giving taxpayers the say-so for future diversions. Taxpayers approved the measure in 2010. As a result, state law forbids the diversions Christie claims he "won’t permit." Our ruling Christie said, "The people who were running the budget, in the Corzine years, decided to steal from the unemployment trust fund. … As did other Governors before. We simply don’t do that, haven’t done it, and won’t permit it." The governor’s claim contains an element of truth, that other administrations have diverted money from the fund, but his hasn’t. The reason? State law now forbids such diversions – something he didn’t say. Although Christie was speaking colloquially about ‘stealing’ from the fund, he was wrong when he pegged diversions to the Corzine administration. The last time such a diversion occurred was when Codey was interim governor. We rate Christie’s statement Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-03820	Says Houston is "home to more doctors, more nurses, more researchers than any other place in the world."	false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-houston-home-most-doctors-nurses-a/	Protesters interrupted Gov. Rick Perry at a Washington, D.C. event by calling for the Republican to support Medicaid’s expansion in Texas as encouraged under Obamacare. According to video snippets of the Feb. 22, 2013, event posted on YouTube, Perry said at one point the protesters hailed from Alabama. After a protester replied that she was from Houston, another woman rose, saying: "Excuse me, Mr. Perry, I’m from Houston, Texas, as well," before suggesting some Houston women lack health insurance. "You know one of the interesting things," Perry replied, "Houston, Texas, is home to more doctors, more nurses, more researchers than any other place in the world--and I'm really proud of what we've done." Is Houston first on the planet all those ways? To our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said by email the governor was referring to the sprawling Texas Medical Center in Houston, and not to an across-the-board tally of doctors, nurses and researchers in the Bayou City. "It is the largest medical complex in world," Havens wrote. Perry did not single out the center in his February remark, though in July 2010, he told a radio host: "When you think about the medical center in Houston, there are more doctors, nurses, researchers go to work there than any other place in the world, every day." His comment was recapped in a July 29, 2010, blog post by the liberal-leaning Think Progress. In contrast, the medical center has not aired such a precise global claim, though its "Facts and Figures" web page refers to the center as "the largest medical complex in the world" employing 92,500 people in 54 entities including government agencies and non-profit health-related institutions on an annual total budget of $14 billion. Center spokeswomen told us by phone and email that they had no precise counts, or planet-wide comparisons, of its physicians, nurses and researchers, though spokeswoman Lisa Mayes said incomplete results from a 2011 survey indicate that more than 21,773 physicians, nurses and researchers worked at the center that year. Center official Laura Jordan said final results, being compiled, will break out the number of physicians, nurses and researchers. Another spokeswoman, Bobbi Gruner, said she doesn’t believe any other medical complex "remotely compares in the entire world." In hosting delegations from more than 100 countries and 50 of the largest U.S. cities, Gruner emailed, "we have found that none have medical assets as concentrated as is the case with the Texas Medical Center. If you look at size alone," she said, "the Texas Medical Center is the 9th largest downtown area in the U.S. If you look at patient visits, the Texas Medical Center had 7.1 million," according to the center’s 2010 survey. In contrast, Gruner noted, Johns Hopkins Medicine, headquartered in Baltimore, says it has more than 2.8 million "outpatient encounters" a year, while the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic reports more than 1.1 million clinic patients a year. Granted, the Houston center is huge. Still, that alone doesn’t make Houston home to the world’s most doctors, nurses and researchers. We did not fare well scouring for independent confirmation of Perry’s statement. Spokespeople for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics pointed out that its counts of health care professionals are based on the nation’s metropolitan statistical areas, which can fold in more than one city or county. For that reason, we were ready to set them aside. But the Greater Houston Partnership, which promotes the Houston-area economy, answered our inquiry by citing the bureau’s analysis. Spokesman Erik Noriega sent a chart drawing on the bureau’s work suggesting the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metro area has the fourth-most individuals (129,930) employed as "healthcare practitioners and technical occupations," a grouping that he said folds in surgeons, doctors, nurses, therapists, medical/clinical technologists and healthcare technicians. The New York (265,020), Los Angeles (206,300) and Chicago (188,340) areas have more workers in the fields, according to the estimates. Separately, U.S. Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein guided us to a table in its "County and City Data Book: 2007" stating the number of physicians by county for each state in 2004 as well as the ratio of physicians to every 100,000 county residents--a reasonable way of adjusting for population differences. In 2004, the table indicates, Harris County had 11,419 physicians, the fourth-highest total nationally behind California’s Los Angeles County (30,102 physicians); Illinois’s Cook County, home to Chicago (21,189); and New York County (19,849). Separately, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Medical Society, Jennifer Snyder, pointed out that according to the Texas Medical Board,, Harris County had 11,821 physicians as of September 2012. Harris County’s 2004 ratio of 314 physicians per 100,000 residents was lower than the ratios in 10 other populous counties, including Bexar County in Texas, home to San Antonio (375). Indeed, eight other Texas counties had more physicians per 100,000 residents than Harris County, according to the bureau’s table. Next, the Texas Department of State Health Services provided August 2011 counts of physicians and nurses for five big Texas cities. According to the information emailed by spokeswoman Christine Mann, Houston then had 6,946 physicians, topping Dallas (4,304), San Antonio (3,485), Austin (2,678) and Fort Worth (1,729). Mann said nearly 22,000 vocational and registered nurses practiced in Houston at that time, more than in San Antonio (13,491); Dallas (13,100); Fort Worth (7,385); and Austin (7,180). We adjusted these totals for each city’s population, as estimated by the census bureau for 2011. By this approach, Dallas had the lowest, or best, ratios of 284 and 93 residents per doctor and nurse, respectively. Austin narrowly bested Houston with 306 local residents per doctor, compared to Houston’s 308, while Houston had the second-lowest ratio of residents per nurse, 98. Our attempts to obtain comparative counts of physicians and nurses spanning the globe came up empty. We did not endeavor to compare the number of researchers in Houston against those in other cities. Our ruling Perry said Houston is "home to more doctors, more nurses, more researchers than any other place in the world." Perry did not provide nor did we find evidence proving this claim, and there are signs that it’s not supported, including the census table indicating that Harris County ranked fourth nationally in total physicians in 2004 and trailed even more counties, including more than half a dozen in Texas, in physicians per 100,000 residents. Also, while Houston had the most doctors and nurses among five populous Texas cities in 2011, Dallas had greater concentrations of physicians and nurses. Finally, there is not yet any confirmation that the Texas Medical Center employs more doctors, nurses and researchers than any other place. That could be. But mights aren’t facts and regardless, Perry specified Houston in his recent statement, not the center. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-03060	Ken Cuccinelli "tried to shut down" state government.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-tried-shut-down-va-gover/	Which gubernatorial candidate is most likely to shut down Virginia’s government? Republican Ken Cuccinelli and Democrat Terry McAuliffe pointed fingers at each other during a Sept. 25 debate. Cuccinelli noted that McAuliffe has repeatedly said that, if elected, he would not a sign a budget that failed to expand the state’s Medicaid program as allowed under Obamacare. Cuccinelli said McAuliffe’s vow is tantamount threatening a state government shutdown -- a statement we’ll look at in the coming days. McAuliffe threw the dart back at Cuccinelli. "The only one on this stage that almost had (a shut down) effected was Ken Cuccinelli, when he almost derailed the Virginia budget when he was trying to defund Planned Parenthood," McAuliffe said. "So he’s the only one on the stage that actually tried to shut down our government." When asked for more information, McAuliffe’s campaign said Cuccinelli tried to padlock state government on Feb. 27, 2008. The General Assembly, deliberating a two-year state budget to go into effect at midyear, faced a procedural deadline that day. The House and the Senate were scheduled to advance competing versions of the budget, which would be ironed out in the coming days by negotiators from each chamber. Cuccinelli, then a state senator, threw a crimp into the proceedings by offering an amendment that would have stripped Planned Parenthood of all state funding -- roughly $250,000 at the time. Democrats, who held a 21-19 majority in the Senate, traditionally had been supportive of Planned Parenthood, while Republicans had been critical of the women’s health group, which provides abortion services. But one of the Democrats -- Sen. Charles Colgan of Prince William County -- was firmly opposed to abortions and planned to vote for Cuccinelli’s amendment. And there was no doubt that Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, would cast a tie-breaking vote to defund Planned Parenthood. Democrats spent much of the afternoon in caucus trying to pressure Colgan to change his vote. They failed, and Bolling pushed the amendment through. Cuccinelli’s victory was short-lived, however. The Planned Parenthood amendment was not part of the final budget approved by the General Assembly two weeks later. McAuliffe’s campaign says an Associated Press story from that day justifies the claim that Cuccinelli "tried to shut down" state government through his amendment. The article said the budget "was almost killed Wednesday in a partisan Senate duel." The story added, however, that the amendment was one of several issues that strained relations that day and kept the Senate in session almost eight hours before it narrowly approved its version of the budget. Even if the Senate had failed to pass its spending plan, the article noted, the state’s complicated budget process would have remained alive. McAuliffe’s campaign also backed the statement by pointing to a 2008 blog from the conservative Family Foundation that said Cuccinelli’s amendment "shut down the Senate for over four hours while Republicans and Democrats fought within their own caucuses." It should be noted that none of the news stories written that day characterized Cuccinelli’s amendment as an attempt to shut down state government or quoted him making such a claim. The General Assembly that year passed a $77 billion biennial budget on March 13. That was five days past its original deadline, which is not an unusual delay. Then-Gov. Tim Kaine signed the budget on May 9 -- 52 days before it went into effect. Our ruling McAuliffe said Cuccinelli "tried to shut down" state government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. Cuccinelli in 2008 offered a budget amendment that would have ended funding for Planned Parenthood, and debate over the measure tied up the Senate for about four hours. McAuliffe offers no credible evidence that Cuccinelli’s intent was to force state government to close. The Senate, later that same day, approved a budget bill. The final version of the state budget was signed by the governor more than seven weeks before it took effect. McAuliffe has invented a crisis to blame on Cuccinelli.

pomt-00463	Says Texas charter schools "get 100% state $/pupil funding while district schools (95% students) get about 1/3 funding from state w/ rest coming from local prop taxes (which is why those taxes are so high). Districts getting less b/c scarce $ going to charters."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/15/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-charter-schools-draw-more-studen/	A Democratic legislator declared that state aid fully fuels Texas charter schools while schools serving the vast bulk of students field less money. State Rep. Donna Howard of Austin said in her July 18, 2018 tweet: "Here's the thing. In Tx, charters get 100% state $/pupil funding while district schools (95% students) get about 1/3 funding from state w/ rest coming from local prop taxes (which is why those taxes are so high). Districts getting less b/c scarce $ going to charters." Howard was reacting to a national Associated Press news story on billionaires championing charter schools. Since 2006, the story says, philanthropists and their private foundations and charities--topped by the Walton Family Foundation, run by heirs to the Walmart fortune--gave almost half a billion dollars to 52 state-level charter support organizations to sustain, defend and expand the charter schools movement. Texas charter schools--public schools with charters run most often by private nonprofit entities--have boomed since the 1995 Legislature authorized them by law. Such schools must meet state-set academic accountability standards, but they’re exempted from other laws affecting districts such as teacher certification and elementary school class-size limits. To our inquiry, Bruce Marchand of the Texas Charter Schools Association called Howard’s jam-packed claim factually "squishy solid." The squishy part, Marchand said by email, "is the implication that ‘100% funded charters’ have something to do with high property taxes and that districts get less money because that money is going to charters." Districts get less, Marchand said, because state dollars follow students based on where they’re enrolled. Let’s break down Howard’s tweet by its factual elements. Howard said charter schools get all their funding from the state: Charter schools get nearly all their funding from state aid, Marchand agreed by phone, drawing 3 percent from grants and federal sources. That heavy state reliance is logical, Marchand and others said, because unlike districts, charter schools lack the authority to levy property taxes. According to a December 2017 Texas Education Agency document summarizing charter school funding, state aid to charter schools escalated from nearly $417 million for 2005-06 to about $2 billion in 2015-16. Howard said school districts serve 95 percent of students: Charter schools serve a growing handful of pupils--5.5 percent of Texas public school students in 2017, according to figures we fielded by email from the TEA’s DeEtta Culbertson. That year, she said, 705 charter campuses enrolled 296,323 students--a doubling since 2011, according to an August 2018 agency presentation noted by Marchand. (The state caps the number of state-issued charters, but a charter-holder may open more than one school.) An implication: Districts in 2017 served 94.5 percent of public school students. Howard said districts get one-third of their aid from the state: Earlier this year, we reviewed Legislative Budget Board figures to conclude that in the 1980s, lawmakers voted for the state to cover 70 percent of the Foundation School Program, which is the state’s primary way of funding schools. State aid, we found, ended up covering a little more than half of related state-local costs. State aid covered 44 percent of such costs in 2016; it’s expected to cover 38 percent of such costs in 2019. That’s more than a third. When we sought Howard’s factual backup, Jacob Cottingham in her office responded with materials including a January 2018 LBB chart delivering percentages like what we previously reported. Cottingham also emailed us a spreadsheet isolating state aid going to districts alone. According to the sheet, which Cottingham said he built based on LBB data, in 2016, more than $17.8 billion in state aid sent to districts accounted for 39 percent of state spending on public education. The sheet says that in 2019, more than $15.7 billion in state funds projected to go to districts will account for 32 percent of state school aid. Howard said the state’s one-third share of what schools spend is why school property taxes are "so high": To the contrary, we asked Howard, isn’t it changes in the value of local property tax bases that drive how much state aid a district is entitled to receive? Howard replied with a statement noting that a district’s per-pupil tax wealth is key to how much state aid flows. "When students leave a district for a charter (or private school or drop out), the (district’s) property wealth per student increases as there are fewer students, and the state's required minimum share to the district is decreased," Howard said. The TEA’s Culbertson separately responded by email: "One of the primary drivers of the Texas school finance system is student attendance. If a student leaves a school district for any reason, including moving out of state, enrolling in another school district, public charter school, or private school (including home school), the original school district would no longer incur the costs of educating that student, and the original school district’s total funding entitlement would be reduced." Howard said districts get less money because dollars go to charter schools: Cottingham told us Howard reached that conclusion by reviewing changes in per-student state spending on charter schools and districts. Cottingham emailed us an LBB chart showing Foundation School Program state aid per student enrolled in districts compared with charter schools from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2016 plus estimated and projected aid for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019. The chart shows charter schools consistently getting thousands of dollars more per student in "average daily attendance:" SOURCE: Chart, "Foundation School Program State Aid and Average Daily Attendance for School Districts and Charter Schools, Fiscal Years 2010-19," Legislative Budget Board, 2018 (confirmed by email, R.J. DeSilva, communications officer, Legislative Budget Board, July 31, 2018) According to the chart, charter schools in 2016 fielded $8,956 in state aid per ADA and school districts on average drew $3,800--meaning charter schools got 136 percent of what districts drew. By our calculations, the chart shows charter schools getting 149 percent of what districts would have gotten in 2017 and 167 percent of what districts would get in 2018 and 190 percent of what districts would get in 2019. Cottingham told us the fact that state aid to districts goes up or down based on the value of local tax bases helps explain why districts are projected to get increasingly less in state aid than charter schools. Charter schools, he said, can count by law on getting each year’s full average adjusted state-aid allotment in contrast to districts whose allocations are affected by how much they’re expected to reap in property taxes. By phone, Amanda Brownson of the Texas Association of School Business Officials offered a similar analysis. Another facet noted by Cottingham: The state ponies up the full per-student "entitlement cost" of each student--costing the state more than each per-student payment sent to districts. Of late, the August 2018 TEA presentation says, charter schools draw an adjusted state allotment of $6,540--equivalent, the agency says, to what a small district receives. Meantime, the presentation says, more than 95 percent of students enrolled in districts are in districts getting less than $6,540 in state allotments. We also heard back from Greg Worthington, a University of Texas doctoral student. By email, Worthington said legislation revising the school finance system that passed into law in a summer 2017 special session would result in numerous districts losing chunks of per-student aid as charter schools draw more. Asked how funding of charter schools results in less money for districts, Worthington offered a detailed reply centered on reductions in aid to districts caused by students transferring to charter schools. This shouldn’t surprise, Worthington indicated, in that the concept of school choice promulgated by the late economist Milton Friedman relies on schools competing for funding tied to enrollment. Friedman said government might be responsible for funding schools, Worthington wrote, but he maintained it isn’t supposed to administer education. School choice policies embraced by many ruling Republicans "ultimately work to replace the public school system with a market-based education system," Worthington said. Our ruling Howard said Texas charter schools get all their per-student aid from the state while school districts, which serve 95 percent of students, get a third of their funding that way with the rest drawn from property taxes. Also, Howard said, districts get less because scarce dollars go to charter schools. Howard’s points about student enrollment and state funding going to charter schools and school districts hold up. It’s also true that a student who leaves a district school to attend a charter school costs the district state aid while that student brings the charter school thousands of dollars more in per-pupil state aid than what the district would get. This dense tweet lacks the clarification that upticks or slides in local property values greatly affect whether a district faces ups or downs in state aid. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02392	"Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion" in tax relief.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/12/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-has-generated-2-billion-t/	Gov. Scott Walker likes to say he "loves" taxpayers. In early March 2014, he counted the ways and declared he’s given Wisconsin taxpayers 2 billion reasons to love him back. "The hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin know how to spend their money better than politicians in Madison do, so I thank members of the Senate for helping us return the state’s surplus to the people who earned it," Walker said in a statement for reporters after his latest tax-cut plan won approval in the Senate. He added this: "Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is signed into law, we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin and more than $135 million for worker training programs." That $2 billion number is likely to be repeated quite a bit during Walker’s re-election bid this year. So we decided to check it out. Is Walker right? It’s clear from the statement that Walker is talking -- at the very least -- about the effect of tax changes enacted during his time in office, including in the four years covered by two budgets he’s signed. The second budget runs through June 2015, six months after Walker’s term expires. The four-year time frame means Walker is lumping into his claim the future effect of some of the tax cuts. But he made it obvious that he was talking about a tally of tax relief that will come come as a result of the actions of this term. The tax-relief number There’s more than one way to get to a bottom line, but we found that Walker’s claim is within $100 million -- high or low -- depending on various factors. Walker’s office sent us a tally of more than 65 tax changes -- mostly cuts, and a few increases -- enacted by legislators and Walker from 2011 to present, including measures from the two budgets. The state budget office calculated the tax relief total at $1.98 billion. Due to some methodology differences, the state Department of Revenue put the total at slightly over $2 billion, according to the spreadsheet provided by Walker’s office. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s director, Bob Lang, and the agency’s tax policy supervisor, Rob Reinhardt, reviewed the list at our request. They put the total at closer to $1.9 billion. "It’s right around $2 billion," Lang told us. So the figure holds up. The tax relief total, we should note, is not a hard number. It can’t be, because it includes estimates of how much tax relief will flow over the course of four-plus years from various measures. And it includes various projections. But that is a routine practice in Madison math and a reasonable way to make a tax-relief claim. Where it came from Most of that total came from moves that drew big headlines, including two separate cuts in income tax rates, multiple property tax relief measures, and phasing out the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Others measured were more narrowly tailored or were overshadowed by other events. They included business tax credits for job creation, various tax cuts for business and a host of technical or small-bore changes including several new sales tax exemptions. Remember the sales tax exemption approved for manufactured homes? Or the one on the sale of oil and fat converted to motor fuel? Or the exemption for printers? We didn’t think so. The income tax cuts alone account for about $750 million in estimated relief, and property tax relief another $500 million. The Walker figures do not include changes in withholding rates that will make sure tax cuts show up in paychecks rather than requiring people to seek refunds to see the benefit. How relieving is all this tax relief? State and local taxes totaled $27.4 billion in 2013. A year’s worth of the four-year relief Walker is talking is about $500 million. So, the relief amounts to about 2 percent of total taxes, says Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Individual results would vary, of course. Finally, Walker administration officials argued that Walker would have been justified in using $2.5 billion as his tax-relief figure. He kept in place and funded several phased-in tax-cut measures put in place during his predecessor Jim Doyle’s last term, spokesman Tom Evenson noted. We’ll confine our ruling here, though, to the $2 billion claim. Our rating Walker declared that once his latest tax-cut plan is signed, "we will have delivered $2 billion in much-needed tax relief for the people of Wisconsin." Some of this is best guesswork, but estimates from multiple sources -- including the nonpartisan office used by the Legislature -- confirm the figure is right around that number. We rate Walker’s statement True. Note: This item was changed after publication. It originally said the Fiscal Bureau's estimate included the effect of changes to the Earned Income and Homestead tax credits.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-03-12T05:00:00	2014-03-04	['None']
pomt-00809	In the United States, we’ve had "12 years in a row of wages declining."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/31/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-says-us-has-seen-falling-wages-12-s/	Assuming she runs, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has assembled a formidable lead in the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. But there’s still a chance she’ll get some competition before the primaries and caucuses start next year. One of those potential candidates is Martin O’Malley, who served two terms as governor of Maryland. O’Malley, like Clinton, hasn’t officially announced a bid yet, but he recently traveled to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary, and he sat for an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. During the interview, O’Malley decried the long-term economic fraying of the American dream, saying the United States has had "12 years in a row of wages declining." A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. We turned to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, zeroing in on the annual averages for median, inflation-adjusted, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers. That sounds like a mouthful -- but when we ran it by two economists, Tara Sinclair of George Washington University and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, both said it was the same metric they would have used. Here’s a summary of the data between 2002 and 2014: Year Median, inflation-adjusted, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers (annual average) Change from previous year 2002 $ 338 -- 2003 337 $ -1 2004 338 +1 2005 333 -5 2006 333 0 2007 335 +2 2008 335 0 2009 345 +10 2010 342 -3 2011 336 -6 2012 335 -1 2013 333 -2 2014 334 +1 Whole period (2002-2014) -- -4 Here’s where O’Malley has a point: Wages were indeed lower in 2014 than they were 12 years earlier. But here’s where his phrasing is misleading: It’s not accurate to say the United States has had "12 years in a row of wages declining." This makes it sound like wages dropped, in lockstep, in each of those 12 years. That’s not the case -- as the chart above shows, wages fell in six of the 12 years, rose in four years, and remained steady in two years. Indeed, over the 12-year period in question, weekly earnings remained in a fairly narrow band -- sometimes rising, sometimes falling, but only deviating by $4 a week over 12 years, a decline of just over 1 percent from where they started in 2002. That’s more accurately described as a sideways trend line than as a steady decline. "Gov. O’Malley misspoke or simply was in error," Burtless said. O’Malley’s office did not dispute the data we found. Spokeswoman Lis Smith said O’Malley has previously used a different formulation -- that "over the last 12 years, wages have been going down, not up." He used that phrasing in Iowa recently, for instance. And that wording would have been more accurate than what he said on This Week. Our ruling O’Malley said that in the United States, we’ve had "12 years in a row of wages declining." He has a point that, using the most appropriate measure of compensation, weekly wages adjusted for inflation are lower now than they were 12 years ago. But they have not fallen consistently and inexorably, as the phrasing of his claim on This Week suggests. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10087	"The race will tighten, just because that's what happens at the end of campaigns. They always have."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/01/barack-obama/elections-tighten-almost-every-time/	(Published Oct. 22, 2008) In a recent interview on the Today show, Sen. Barack Obama predicted his lead in the polls would shrink, because that's what happens toward the end of presidential campaigns. So let's start with some context from Obama's exchange with Matt Lauer: "Do you see a path to victory for John McCain?" Lauer asked. "There's no doubt," Obama replied. "I mean, I – we think that the race will tighten, just because that's what happens at the end of campaigns. They always have. They even – when there are substantial leads. And in each of these battleground states, you've got a lot of close races. One of the messages that I've had to my team is that we don't let up. We do not let up." The interview was taped Oct. 19, 2008, which was 16 days before the election. We looked at every election since 1944 to see if poll averages in early November were tighter than they had been at any time in the prior few weeks, a loose time frame we decided was an appropriate interpretation of Obama's somewhat vague claim that races get tighter at the "end of campaigns." Fortunately, a pair of political scientists, Christopher Wlezien from Temple University and Robert Erikson from Columbia University, had done the hard part. They compiled averages of the incumbent-party candidate's standing – in a hypothetical match-up of the two major-party candidates – in all major polls in the run-up to the past 16 elections, broken down by day. They've used the data in several published papers, and several other political scientists told us it was the best available on the subject. Because these numbers reflect an average of several polls, even small changes in the average reflect more significant changes in the underlying polls. Their spreadsheet enabled us to see, for instance, that in 1972, Richard Nixon was polling at 67.8 percent 17 days before the election. Just prior to Election Day, however, he was polling at 63.6 percent. So yes, that election did tighten at the end. (Nixon won with 60.7 percent of the vote, by the way.) Some tightened far less. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was leading Walter Mondale with more than 61 percent in the average of all polls taken 11, 12 and 13 days before the election. Just prior to Election Day, his lead had shrunk to 60.2 percent. (Reagan won with 58.8 percent.) So that race tightened less – but still, it tightened. (Slight changes in polling averages are less significant the further back in time you go, because there were fewer polls, but we gave Obama the benefit of the doubt if the polling averages reflected even a minor tightening.) Not every election got closer, though. In 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower never topped a 59 percent average in polls until about the last week before the election. He peaked in early November at 59.4 percent. The 1960 election didn't get any tighter at the end either. But every other one did. That is, out of the past 16 elections, 14 tightened at least somewhat in the last few weeks. A commonly cited explanation for this, Wlezien said, is that voters who are undecided toward the end of a campaign are not likely to feel strongly about either candidate, and thus are likely to split 50-50 between them. That pushes the race in the direction of a tie. While we were at it, we looked in more detail at the elections since 1980, to see how the final results compared to the last few polls. Six of those seven elections have been tighter than the polls in the final few days indicated they would be. That said, the candidate who was ahead in most polls two to three weeks before the election ended up winning every time. (Gore briefly polled better than Bush in 2000, but that was for just one out of the last 21 days. Similarly, Carter polled better than Reagan in 1980, but for only three out of the last 21 days.) But we're not in the prediction business, we're in the fact business. And the fact is, 14 out of the last 16 elections have tightened in the final few weeks of the campaign. So Obama's claim that elections tighten at the end is Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-12-01T00:00:00	2008-10-19	['None']
pomt-10201	"I have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/16/john-mccain/mccains-record-on-pork-good-not-perfect/	Sen. John McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster. The GOP presidential nominee regularly castigates colleagues when they insert language in spending bills forcing taxpayers everywhere to pay for projects only of interest to a select few. But we sure wish that McCain would stop claiming, as he has repeatedly throughout the campaign, that he has never sought any pork for his own state. The latest instance is in a speech he made in Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 16, 2008. He said: "I have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona. Sen. Obama has asked for $932-million dollars in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he's been in Congress." We examined the claim he's making about Barack Obama's record in another item here. In this one, we'll look at what McCain is boasting about himself. It echoes a point McCain made in a mailer being distributed in Florida in which McCain claims to have "never sought a single dollar" in pork barrel funding. It's just not true. As PolitiFact writer John Frank pointed out earlier this year, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late Supreme Court chief justice William Rehnquist. In 2003, Frank noted, McCain won authorization to buy property to create a buffer zone around Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, and in 1992, McCain asked the Environmental Protection Agency to provide $5-million toward a wastewater project in Nogales, Ariz. While McCain would surely say these projects don't meet the definition of pork barrel spending, watchdogs disagree. "If it doesn't meet the technical term of earmark, it would probably meet the public idea of one," Pete Sepp, a vice president at the conservative, anti-pork National Taxpayers Union, told the New York Times in reference to the Rehnquist center request. By most senators' standards, McCain's pork barrel requests are minuscule, but they do exist. And given the absolutism in McCain's claim, we rule his statement False.

pomt-11442	Says China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-china-singapore-have-death-penal/	President Donald Trump floated the idea of imposing the death penalty on drug dealers in the United States during his Pennsylvania rally, saying China and Singapore do it and they don’t have a drug problem. "The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness," Trump said March 10 while stumping for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone. "When you catch a drug dealer … you got to put him away for a long time." Trump shared conversations he had with leaders of China and Singapore. "When I was in China and other places, by the way, I said, Mr. President, do you have a drug problem? ‘No, no, no, we do not.’ I said, Huh. Big country, 1.4 billion people, right. Not much of a drug problem. I said what do you attribute that to? ‘Well, the death penalty.’" On Singapore, "I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? ‘No. We don't have a problem, President.’ I said, really why? ‘We have a zero tolerance.’ And he is not playing games … So what do you mean no problem? ‘We have a zero tolerance policy.’ What does that mean? ‘That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty.’ " PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed. (We will set aside for now whether these countries have "no" drug problems as a result, as Trump claimed the leaders said.) We found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic, smuggle or transport certain drugs. The White House did not comment on the record, but in the context of Trump’s speech, it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about "drug dealers" — not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets. Nonetheless, China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices, and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States. China’s laws Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties. The law mentions certain amounts of opium, heroin, methylaniline and "other narcotic drugs of large quantities." Human rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown. That information is kept as a state secret. Amnesty International estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year. Given data limitations, it's difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders. Singapore's law Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances. The law said the word "traffic" means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute. Individuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking, unless proven otherwise. Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances. A March 2010 study on executions, deterrence and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are "no decent indicators" available regarding drug use over time in Singapore, and if the data exists, "they are a government secret." Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking "as a most serious crime," and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore. Singapore had eight executions for drugs from 2015 to 2017, according to a March 2018 report from Harm Reduction International. American application Drug policy and law experts said attempts at similar laws in the United States would face constitutional obstacles. They pointed to a high bar for the death penalty established in the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy vs. Louisiana, which addressed whether states violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by imposing the death sentence for the crime of child rape. The court’s opinion said "the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken." However, the court said its concern was limited to crimes against individual persons and did not address offenses against the State, such as treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity. Congress in 1994 enacted a law allowing the imposition of the death penalty for drug kingpins even if no death occurred. "If the death penalty is unconstitutional to impose against a child rapist, it is hard to imagine a court upholding its imposition against a person for selling drugs," said Alex Kreit, a law professor and co-director of the Center for Criminal Law and Policy at Thomas Jefferson School of Law. Experts also questioned how effective the death penalty would be as a deterrent for drug offenders. "The likelihood of getting caught, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to death — especially at the federal level with only three executions since 1964 — is tiny," said Matthew Robinson, a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University. Our ruling Trump said China and Singapore impose the death penalty on drug dealers. Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions can receive a death sentence. Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act also calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances.

pomt-06539	Says Barack Obama is a "hypocrite" for criticizing President George W. Bush’s "drone attack program," then using it aggressively as president.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/05/john-fleming/should-obama-apologize-policy-shift-drone-strikes-/	During an Oct. 3, 2011, appearance on the Fox Business Network, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said he agreed with comments critical of President Barack Obama that former Vice President Dick Cheney had offered one day earlier during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Cheney had argued that Obama had criticized aspects of the Bush-Cheney approach to countering terrorism, yet once in office chose to follow many of his predecessors’ policies. "If you've got the president of the United States out there saying we overreacted to 9/11 on our watch, that's not good," Cheney said. Host Candy Crowley then asked Cheney, "You'd like an apology, it sounds like?" Cheney responded, "Well, I would. I think that would be, not for me, but I think for the Bush administration. …" Fleming, in his Fox Business Network interview, echoed Cheney’s line of argument. During the interview, host Eric Bolling asked Fleming, "Does the president owe an apology to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney?" Fleming answered, "Absolutely, Eric. I agree with the former Vice President. President Obama is more and more beginning to look like the hypocrite-in-chief when it comes to the war on terrorism. All sorts of things that he criticized the president for, he's actually continued and even extended. This drone attack program, he's got it at the highest level ever." The final part of Fleming’s comment is what caught our eye -- that Obama had essentially flip-flopped on the use of drones to attack terrorist targets. The issue was particularly timely because just days earlier, Obama had announced the killing by drone of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born extremist Muslim cleric linked to several terrorist plots against Americans. He had been considered one of the nation’s top terrorist targets. Many human-rights advocates have expressed feelings about drone strikes that range from unease to outright opposition. So we decided to check whether Obama had expressed opposition to using drones to assassinate terrorist targets prior to becoming president. (We did not receive a reply from Fleming’s office for this story.) First, some background on drones, recapping what we first published in a pair of analyses in 2010. Drones are remote-controlled, pilotless planes that can conduct surveillance and, if specially equipped, fire weapons on targets of interest, sometimes killing individuals. Because using drones does not put U.S. troops at direct risk, they have become increasingly in demand as a tool for combating terrorists. Drones were initially used during the George W. Bush administration, but their use has increased under Obama. They have been used with regularity on the battlefields of Iraq, Afghanistan and in tribal areas of Pakistan by uniformed military forces, and have also reportedly been used by the CIA. Since 2011 is not yet over, it’s not possible to know whether this year will set a record for drone attacks, as Fleming suggested. However, it’s clear that the Obama Administration has used them aggressively and far more than Bush did. According to statistics compiled by the centrist New America Foundation, the U.S. made nine drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and 2007, 33 in 2008, 53 in 2009 -- Obama’s first year in office -- and 118 in 2010. Through Oct. 2, 2011, the foundation recorded 60 strikes, which would not be a record-setting pace. However, in general, Fleming is correct that their use has increased under Obama. Cheney has a point that the Obama administration is now carrying out some of the policies it once opposed. Obama has backed off plans to close Guantanamo (we rated this a Promise Broken) and to enact an alternative to military tribunals (also a Promise Broken). But did Obama -- as Fleming suggests -- do a 180 on drone attacks? We see no evidence of it. A White House spokesman told us that candidate Obama hadn’t criticized drone attacks. None of the 500-plus campaign promises we have been tracking dealt with drones. In Google and Nexis searches, we found no criticism of drone attacks by Obama or his campaign aides. F. Whitten Peters -- a Washington attorney who, as a supporter unaffiliated with the campaign, co-authored an Oct. 20, 2008, op-ed praising Obama’s military and counter-terrorism agenda -- said he didn’t recall hearing any criticism from the campaign about the drone program. And a foreign policy scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation said he didn’t remember any either. "I do not recall offhand any Obama criticisms of drones," said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at Heritage. "He did regularly criticize the Bush Administration's broader counter-terrorism policies as lawless," even though he continued many of these policies. Bromund added that Obama’s disinclination to curb drone attacks "has been widely criticized on the left," so much so that the administration had to assign Harold Koh, the State Department's legal adviser, to defend it publicly in a March 25, 2010, address to the American Society of International Law. Koh, the former dean of Yale Law School, came into office as a hero of liberal human-rights activists, but his high-profile justification for drone strikes has driven a wedge between him and many of his old allies. Justifications such as Koh’s "are on weak ground," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a University of Notre Dame law professor. "International law does not support attacking on a state’s territory where the state is not responsible for a significant armed attack on the defender." In the meantime, we found two pieces of evidence that suggested that candidate Obama was comfortable with targeting terrorists for assassination and with drones. In a foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in August 2007, Obama said he understood that then-Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf "has his own challenges. But let me make this clear: There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won’t act, we will." This stance became controversial, earning criticism from his primary rival (and future Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton, as well as Obama’s eventual general-election opponent, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Meanwhile, in a policy paper called "A 21st Century Military for America," the Obama campaign promised to "preserve our unparalleled airpower capabilities to deter and defeat any conventional competitors, swiftly respond to crises across the globe, and support our ground forces. … We need greater investment in advanced technology ranging from the revolutionary, like unmanned aerial vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities, to systems like the C-17 cargo and KC-X air refueling aircraft — which may not be glamorous to politicians, but are the backbone of our future ability to extend global power." Neither of these two pieces of evidence proves that candidate Obama supported a policy of assassination-by-drone. The Wilson Center speech doesn’t cite drone attacks by name, and the position paper doesn’t specifically say that the drones it supports would be used to target terrorists. But along with the lack of any other evidence to the contrary, we think it’s fair to say that Obama did not change his position on drones between the time he was a candidate and the time he entered the Oval Office. Our ruling Fleming -- and Cheney -- have a point that Obama has flip-flopped on some positions concerning counter-terrorism, notably his decision not to close Guantanamo. But Fleming was wrong when he cited the "drone attack program" as evidence that Obama was a hypocrite. We find no evidence to support the claim that candidate Obama opposed drone strikes on terrorist targets and no hypocrisy when he increased the frequency of those strikes well beyond what Bush, his predecessor, did. We rate Fleming’s statement False.	None	John Fleming	None	None	None	2011-10-05T16:01:52	2011-10-03	['None']
pomt-09348	The proposed education changes "will not cut one teacher's pay."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/07/florida-chamber-commerce/florida-chamber-says-education-proposals-wont-cut-/	As the debate over proposed education reforms continues to ratchet up in Tallahassee, groups on both sides are taking to the airwaves. Groups supporting and opposing SB 6 and HB 7189, the Senate and House education bills, recently launched television spots to bolster their arguments. The Florida Chamber of Commerce, a main proponent of Republican-led legislation, is running 30-second advertisement that blames "Tallahassee union lobbyists" for misleading citizens about the education proposals. "Tallahassee union lobbyists have been paid a fortune to bash anyone in their way, now backing a shadow group against rewarding our best teachers," the ad begins, with images of men in dark suits and sunglasses talking in the background. "Fact is these reforms will not cut one teacher's pay or cut one retirement benefit." In this item, we're going to put the claim about teacher pay to the Truth-O-Meter. SB 6 and HB 7189 are identical education proposals being considered in the Legislature that would radically alter how teachers are evaluated and compensated. Under the plan -- which was first pushed by Senate Republicans -- teacher pay increases would be tied to student performance on end-of-course exams. Gone would be the standard calculations for years of service. Teachers are dug in against the proposal, saying that the changes would punish good teachers, take decisions out of the hands of school districts and require local schools to either further cut budgets or raise taxes. There has been much disagreement about what the education reforms would do to teachers and classrooms, and both sides are now touting myth vs. fact bulletins to help get out their message. Here's the myth vs. fact statements from the chamber. Here's an eerily similar myth vs. fact sheet from House Republicans (and by eerily similar, we mean pretty much identical). And here's the other side from the Florida Education Association. We've seen claims on the Internet and heard about talk among teachers that SB 6 and HB 7189 could mean a pay cut for educators. To examine that claim, let's compare the current system to the one legislators are considering. The current pay system Florida's 67 school districts set their own teacher pay scales. In most every case, they are based on two factors --- level of degree and years of experience. In Orange County, for example, a teacher with 10 years experience and a bacherlor's degree earns $41,720. In Pinellas, that same teacher earns $40,083. If the same teacher has a Master's degree, they earn $44,325 in Orange and $43,010 in Pinellas. Teachers can get paid extra for coaching sports or advising a club. The state also has bonuses available to high performing teachers. As a teacher gains experience or gets an advanced degree, their salary goes up. The proposed pay system Under the new system, teachers would no longer be slotted into a pay scale based on experience or degree. So those salary scales in Orange and Pinellas would disappear. For existing teachers, salaries would be frozen where they are. New teachers would start at one salary (regardless of education), and teachers transferring from another state would start at another salary (regardless of years of service). The exact salaries would be set by individual school districts. Starting in 2015, teacher raises would depend on their annual evaluations, and half of those evaluations would be calculated using student performance statistics. Are there pay cuts in the bill? We examined the bill and analyses of it prepared for state legislators to see if there is any pay cut. We found there were no such cuts mandated or suggested in the bill. The only thing that came close was how the bill would affect a teacher's potential earnings. Their ultimate salary in the future could vary depending on how they rank in the proposed new system. For example, while a teacher would expect to see small salary increases based on years of service under the current system, their salary could remain the same for several years under the reform plan. But it could also mean they would receive bigger raises faster. The performance pay raises are just that -- raises -- not bonuses, and stay a part of the a teacher's base compensation. It's also worth noting that starting salaries for new teachers could be cut, since that's a detail to be worked out by local school districts. But that wouldn't affect educators currently teaching in Florida's schools. None of this means, however, that pay cuts aren't possible. It just says that they aren't directly spelled out in the bills. School district administrators fear that the cost of implementing the reforms -- no one knows the final price tag -- will force districts to either raise taxes or slash budgets (we previously ruled that the bill represents an unfunded mandate for school districts). And if budgets have to be cut, salaries and benefits are an obvious target --- they make up 80 to 85 percent of a district's budget. Pinellas School board member Carol Cook said that the financial mandate imposed by SB 6/HB 7189 on top of other budget pressures could force Pinellas to reconsider small raisies it agreed to give teachers in 2010-11. "I’d like to turn over every stone before we do that. But there aren’t many stones left to turn over,” Cook told the St. Petersburg Times. Duval County superintendent Ed Pratt-Dannals told PolitiFact Florida that his district could face at least $42 million in unfunded mandates if the education reforms pass. He also notes that Duval County -- and all districts across Florida -- will lose millions of dollars in federal stimulus funding "with no legislative plan for replacement." While it's impossible to predict the future, we have to at least consider those claims in analyzing the Florida Chamber of Commerce ad. To recap: In its attempt to promote SB 6 and HB 7189, the Florida Chamber of Commerce notes that the education reforms tying teacher pay increases to student performance will not "cut one teacher's pay." The chamber is right that there's nothing in the education bills that cuts teachers' pay. But teacher salaries could fluctuate in the new performance pay system when compared with the system currently in place. And there is a fear among school district administrators that the cost to implement the SB 6/HB 7189 changes might result in less money to be directed to teacher salaries. As such, we rate the Florida Chamber of Commerce statement Mostly True.	None	Florida Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2010-04-07T16:32:01	2010-04-02	['None']
pomt-00724	"Hillary Clinton’s State Department sent three comedians to India on the ‘Make Chai, Not War’ tour."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/apr/24/rand-paul/did-state-department-really-send-three-comedians-i/	When Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took to the stage in New Hampshire to woo voters at a Republican presidential summit, he took aim at Democrat Hillary Clinton. The pair have both formally declared their intentions to run for the country’s highest office. Paul went after Clinton’s time as Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013, criticizing several purchases and investments the department made during her tenure. "Hillary Clinton’s State Department sent three comedians to India on the ‘Make Chai, Not War,’ " he quipped, garnering laughter from the audience. It’s not the first time he’s dropped that line, and it grabbed our attention. The U.S. State Department pointed to a press conference in December 2011, when a spokeswoman answered questions about the comedy tour. The press conference drew some laughter from reporters, as noted in the transcript. The department sent three Indian-American comedians, who were part of a show called "Make Chai, not War" on the seven-city tour through India as part of a "regular global cultural exchange program," former state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters during the 2011 daily press briefing. While the title of the show was intentionally a joke, the purpose of the tour was more serious. The trip was intended to stem religious prejudice and encourage tolerance. The trio of comics traveled India from Jan. 4 to Jan. 17, 2012. In addition to comedy shows, Nuland said, they held audience discussions focused on issues of religious tolerance, ran workshops and did interviews with the press. The full tour cost about $100,000, and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi sponsored it with a $88,000 grant, Nuland said. "The reason we decided to support this tour is because among the things that they are known for is their talk about religious tolerance, about the importance of breaking down prejudices, and about the positive experiences they had growing up as Indian Americans in the United States," Nuland said at the press conference according to the transcript. But the state department can’t claim credit for the tour’s catchy title. One of the three comics, Rajiv Satyal, launched the Make Chai, Not War show in 2007 to create a platform for other Indian-American comedians, according to a National Public Radio story published before the group embarked to India. The show’s Indian tour came about after U.S. Embassy cultural attache Michael Macy saw one of the comics, Azhar Usman, perform in London, according to NPR. When Macy switched to a post in New Delhi, he brought the comic to India for a solo tour, which paved the way to the "Make Chai, Not War" India tour, according to NPR. Stand-up comedy is an American art form, that is "all about celebration of free speech," Usman said Thursday. "Comedy has a very unique ability to allow people to have very difficult conversations that society may otherwise ignore," he said. "To me it was a huge win." Dating back to the 1940s, Secretaries of State have signed off on cultural exchange programs around the world. The current state department budget contains about about $100 million for Citizen Exchange Program, which includes cultural exchanges like the one to India. It’s not the first time Paul has invoked the "Make Chai Not War" tour to make a point. He brought it up while grilling Clinton at a 2013 U.S. Senate hearing about attacks on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. "I can understand that maybe you’re not aware that your department spent $100,000 on three comedians who went to India on a promotional tour called "Make Chai Not War," Paul said, according to a Wall Street Journal transcript of the exchange. Paul mentioned it again during a later hearing with Clinton’s replacement, former Mass. Senator John Kerry, according to the Washington Post. For the record, Paul’s claim didn’t cite money or motive. Our ruling Paul said "Hillary Clinton’s State Department sent three comedians to India on the ‘Make Chai Not War tour." The State Department, while under the leadership of Clinton, did send three Indian-American comics to India in early 2012 as part of a regular cultural exchange program intended to stem religious prejudices and encourage tolerance. The State Department didn’t come up with the name, but the show was indeed called "Make Chai Not War." We rate this claim True.

pomt-11966	Says "the Kardashians donate whopping sum to Las Vegas mass shooting victims"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/03/houstonchronicle-tvcom/its-fake-news-kardashians-donated-1-million-las-ve/	It’s not true that the Kardashian family has donated $1 million to Las Vegas shooting victims, despite a post on HoustonChornicle-tv.com claiming it to be a fact. An undated post on HoustonChronicle-tv.com claims the reality TV family "will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims." Fifty-nine people were killed and more than 500 injured during an Oct. 1 concert on the Las Vegas Strip after a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, across from the concert venue. HoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed (and minimally altered) a statement to the Kardashians that was actually said in August by the chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Co. after committing to give $1 million to the American Red Cross to support Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts. "Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic storm," Disney’s Robert A. Iger said in his statement. "It’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because it isn’t over yet. But we know thousands of people have lost everything and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need." Below in bold is how HoustonChronicle-tv.com modified the quote. HoustonChronicle-tv.com claimed Kim Kardashian said: "Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting." It adds that the family said: "It’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting their lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need." The post also claims Khloé Kardashian tweeted, "Las Vegas we are praying for you," immediately after announcing the family’s donation. Khloé Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted condolences after the Las Vegas shooting and said "My prayers are with you!" but she did not write the specific words claimed by HoustonChronicle-tv.com. Kim Kardashian on Oct. 2 tweeted: "Woke up to the most devastating news about Las Vegas. I’m praying for everyone in Las Vegas!" She also tweeted and retweeted about gun control and violence and about the need for blood donations in Las Vegas. Kim Kardashian on Aug. 29 tweeted that her mom, sisters and her would be donating $500,000 to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army USA to help with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. But there have been no official reports or tweets from her or her family about donations after the Las Vegas shooting. HoustonChronicle-tv.com also claimed the Kardashians would be hosting a "Day of Giving" on Oct. 7 "to benefit those impacted by the shooting." That also mimic's Disney’s August press release after Hurricane Harvey, which said that on Aug. 31 it would "host a ‘Day of Giving’ to benefit those impacted by the hurricane." PolitiFact has labeled HoustonChronicle-tv.com as an imposter site. The website is not affiliated with the actual Houston Chronicle newspaper, whose true website is chron.com, and it is not the website for a TV news station.

pomt-07350	Wrote that in 2006, Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t think capturing Osama bin Laden "makes us any safer," but in 2011 called his killing "historic."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/09/blog-posting/bloggers-say-nancy-pelosi-2006-said-getting-bin-la/	After the killing of Osama bin Laden in a special forces attack on May 1, 2011, it didn’t take long for conservative bloggers to offer up a 2006 quote from House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that expressed skepticism about the importance of eliminating the terrorist who masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. On May 2, 2011, the conservative PowerLine blog posted a quote it said came from Pelosi in 2006. Others followed, including Michelle Malkin’s blog, Fox Nation and Commentary magazine. Here’s the PowerLine version: "(E)ven if (Osama bin Laden) is caught tomorrow, it is five years too late. He has done more damage the longer he has been out there. But, in fact, the damage that he has done is done. And even to capture him now I don’t think makes us any safer." The blog paired that with a statement that Pelosi -- the former House speaker and now the House minority leader -- released shortly after President Barack Obama announced bin Laden’s death to the nation on May 1: "The death of Osama bin Laden marks the most significant development in our fight against al-Qaida. I salute President Obama, his national security team, Director Panetta, our men and women in the intelligence community and military, and other nations who supported this effort for their leadership in achieving this major accomplishment. … (T)he death of Osama bin Laden is historic." PowerLine went on to argue that her seemingly different sentiments may have been colored by the fact that the White House in 2006 was occupied by a Republican (George W. Bush) and in 2011 by a Democrat (Obama). "It is unfortunate that many public figures are unable to view events otherwise than through a partisan prism," PowerLine argued. "Osama bin Laden's operational significance had undoubtedly dwindled over the years, and al-Qaida, after nine years of relentless attacks, is a shadow of its former self. But bin Laden's death is obviously an important and helpful milestone in the long war against radical Islam. …" Several readers asked us whether Pelosi had really said that capturing Osama bin Laden does not make "us any safer". So we decided to look into it. Pelosi did indeed say those words in a Sept. 7, 2006, press conference. In her opening remarks -- made just days before the fifth anniversary of the attacks -- she criticized the Bush administration and the then-Republican Congress for not enacting all the recommendations of the 9/11 commission. Here’s a transcript of the full exchange that bloggers would eventually pick up on. Reporter: "Madam Leader, you mentioned Osama bin Laden, but that is a name we haven't heard in months, and now suddenly every time you turn around it is Osama bin Laden, Osama bin Laden. Now, not to throw you a real softball here, but what do you make of the idea that that is all in fact what we are hearing now? Do you think it is designed specifically to whip up fervor, fear, prior to the midterm elections?" Pelosi: "You know, I'm never one to question the motivation of people. I just want to question their effectiveness. Five years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden, who was going to be taken 'dead or alive'... you know what the president said at the time, and I wish that he had been... five years later he is still on the loose. The president said, 'You can run but you can't hide, Osama bin Laden.’ Apparently he could. And even if he is caught tomorrow, it is five years too late. He has done more damage the longer he has been out there. But, in fact, the damage that he has done is done. And even to capture him now I don't think makes us any safer." We think the bloggers are accurate in reporting Pelosi’s 2006 quote. She did indeed say that taking out bin Laden wouldn’t make the U.S. any safer, though we should also note that, from the context, it’s clear that she thought bin Laden should be pursued regardless. The bloggers’ reporting of the second Pelosi quote -- the one from after bin Laden’s killing -- is incomplete, however. The final sentence of Pelosi’s statement reads, "Though the death of Osama bin Laden is historic, it does not diminish our relentless pursuit of terrorists who threaten our country" (emphasis added). In other words, the full text of what Pelosi said on May 1 communicates a more nuanced view, and one that’s less in conflict with her 2006 statement. As it happens, Pelosi doubled down on this more nuanced view during her weekly news conference on May 5, 2011. Osama bin Laden, she told reporters, "is a person, he is a symbol. It is a historic event. ‘Hail to the Chief.’ (Obama) did a fabulous job. But it isn't an end to the threat to our national security... ." Ultimately, we think the bloggers overstated the degree to which Pelosi’s 2006 and 2011 comments were contradictory. They are correct that Pelosi in 2006 said she didn’t think capturing Osama Bin Laden "makes us any safer" and then five years later celebrated his killing as "historic." But, because they left out the rest of her sentence referring to the threat that remains after bin Laden's death, we rate their claim Half True.

pomt-03575	"Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/17/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-more-half-virginias-teachers-are-50/	Virginia’s public school teaching corps is getting gray, says Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee for governor. "Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old," McAuliffe said during an April 27 speech at the opening of his Fairfax County campaign office. McAuliffe, who has been endorsed by the Virginia Education Association, said the statistics mean "we’ve got to build a pipeline of new teachers." To compete for the best teachers, McAuliffe said Virginia needs to substantially improve their pay and protect their retirement benefits. We wondered whether more than half of Virginia’s public school teachers really are older than 50. So we took a look and found that McAuliffe’s had merged figures from two databases that measure different things. Let’s consider McAuliffe’s numbers as a fraction. The numerator, or number on top, is 53,000. The denominator, or number on the bottom, is 98,000. First, let’s look at the numerator. Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the campaign got the number of 53,000 teachers older than 50 from the Virginia Retirement System, which manages the public school pensions of all full-time instructors. But there’s a problem with this number. VRS spokeswoman Jeanne Chenault told us that tally represents not just teachers over 50, but all of the full-time "professional or clerical employees" of school divisions across the state who have crossed that age threshold -- including administrators, counselors and secretaries. The VRS does not have age data for just teachers. Chenault said school employment numbers fluctuate and that the most current data, from June 2012, show 56,328 full time workers were 50 or older. Now, let’s look at the denominator. Schwerin sent us a slide from a state Department of Education presentation that said during 2010-11 school year, Virginia schools had an instructional staff of about 98,792. But this is the wrong figure to use. The correct denominator is 147,216 --which is the number of all full time public school employees at the end of last June. So, if McAuliffe is to rely on VRS information, the most he can say is that at the end of last school year, 56,328 of the 147,216 full time public school employees -- or 38.3 percent -- were 50 or older. That’s a far cry from McAuliffe’s claim that more than half of the teachers had crossed 50. We can drill to a more accurate estimate of the number of teachers who have lived a half century. Virginia’s Department of Education kept age data on the instructional staff at public schools -- teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- through the 2010-11 school year. It no longer keeps those records. The same DOE slide presentation cited by McAuliffe’s campaign that shows the instructional staff at 98,792 at the end of the 2011 school year also says, on a different slide, that 33,462 of them were 50 or older. That breaks down to 33.9 percent. The state government’s workforce, by comparison, is older. VRS data from last year -- which does not include state troopers and other law enforcement officers, judges and college faculty -- shows that of 76,274 state bureaucrats, 37,290 were 50 or older. That’s 48.9 percent. Let’s also consider the national workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was an average of 133.6 million full and part-time workers in the U.S. last year who were at least 20. Of them, 48.3 million were at least 50. That’s 36.2 percent. We should note that there has been some aging in nation’s teaching corps, as pointed out in a 2010 reportby the National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future. It said many Baby Boomers chose classroom careers in the 1960’s and ‘70’s, making the average age of teachers 36, "one of the youngest teaching forces in history." But by 2004, those Baby Boomers, who were still the majority, had aged and the national average was pushed to 42.5, "older than it had been in more than half a century." The average retirement age for teachers is 59, the report said. "We can expect to lose as many as a million and a half veteran teachers to retirement during the next eight years," the report said. The turnover of teachers is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. "Policymakers want to keep great teachers in the classroom for as long as they can and encourage new, young talent into the profession," Emily Workman, an associate policy analyst for the Education Commission of the States, wrote to us in an email. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old." But he is mixing statistics that don’t don’t go together and his eye-popping claim that more than half of Virginia’s teachers have lived more than half a century doesn’t hold up. Virginia does not keep data that is solely focused on the age of teachers. The best statistics available show that the state’s instructional staff -- including teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- was 98,792 during the 2010-11 school year and, of them, 33,462 were 50 or older. That’s 33.9 percent. The teaching corps is not moving toward retirement with anything close to the speed that McAuliffe described. We rate his statement False.

pomt-07586	Ending federal funding for National Public Radio would jeopardize 9,000 jobs.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/26/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-ending-federal-funding-npr-woul/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran took to the House floor March 17 to defend National Public Radio. The Northern Virginia Democrat’s speech came before the House voted to approve a bill that would strip federal funding from NPR and bar local stations from using their own federal money to buy NPR programs. "Most people like their local NPR station; I like mine," Moran said. "...But the funding restrictions put forward in this legislation strike at the heart of these great stations. It will cripple their ability to produce local programming. Eliminating funding for NPR would do little to rein in our national debt. It will not create jobs. In fact, 9,000 would be in jeopardy if this passes." We wondered if 9,000 jobs would really be put at risk by the bill. First, a word on how funding works for NPR and local affiliates. NPR is an independent media company funded by a variety of sources. Independently owned, non-profit stations around the nation pay a membership fee to join the NPR network and then purchase programs produced by NPR, such as Morning Edition or All Things Considered. Stations also produce their own programs and buy shows from other sources, such as Public Radio International, which produces This American Life, or American Public Media, which produces Marketplace. NPR says 34 percent of its funding comes from station programming fees and another 22 percent from sponsorships. The company receives about 2 percent of its money from the U.S. government, via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and grants awarded by other federal departments. Local public radio stations, such as Richmond’s WCVE, are endowed by a variety of sources, including funds from the CPB. The radio station shares $1.12 million in federal money with public TV stations in Richmond and Charlottesville, an amount that makes up 14 percent of the budget for the TV and radio stations. Other funds come from the state government, private donations and corporate sponsorships. Stacey Karp, who works for the Association of Public Television Stations, said 21,000 people work in public TV or radio, with about 40 percent, or 8,400, working for NPR or local affiliates. The association and NPR have joined forces during the current debates over public media funding. So Moran is saying Lamborn’s bill puts every single public radio job at risk. The bill approved by the House -- and now before the Senate -- was introduced by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo. It would remove $5 million in direct federal funding from NPR. It would also forbid stations from using the federal money they get from CPB to buy NPR programming or pay their NPR membership dues. "It would require the stations to keep strict accounts and separate those funds," said Catherine Mortensen, a spokesperson for Lamborn. She said the money could be spent on maintenance, staff salaries and the production of local programming, as well as any other expenses not related directly to NPR programming. Local stations could still use their other funds, such as donations from individuals or corporations, to purchase NPR programs or pay membership fees. In the end, the only money actually lost would be the $5 million removed from NPR. According to the company’s audited financial statements, revenue for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2010 was $184.3 million, up from $148.7 million the prior year. So losing the $5 million would have cost NPR 2.7 percent of its 2010 revenue or 3.4 percent of its 2009 revenue. Neither of those percentages seem like they’d put NPR out of business. Under Lamborn’s bill the various member stations would not lose any CPB money; they would just be restricted in its use. So while some dollars might need to be redirected, overall funding for stations should remain unaffected. Moran could have easily attacked another GOP-sponsored bill that has a far greater potential to put public radio jobs at risk. The House’s proposed budget for the rest of fiscal 2011 eliminated all federal funding for the CPB. The corporation received $420 million in fiscal 2010 fiscal is slated to receive $430 million for this fiscal year. The House budget was rejected by the Senate, leading the two chambers and President Barack Obama to compromise on two "continuing resolutions" that will keep the federal government operating until April 8. But Moran was not referring to the House budget bill in his March 17 speech. He was clearly attacking H.R. 1076, Lamborn’s bill. Let’s review. Moran said H.R. 1076, which would strip NPR of federal funding and set certain rules on how public radio stations nationwide could spend federal money, would put 9,000 jobs at risk. He based this on information from NPR, and a spokeswoman for public TV and radio said 8,400 people work in public radio. But even if this House-approved bill gets past the Senate and is signed by the president, it would cost NPR a very small fraction of its total budget. And it would not cost local stations any money at all. With no dollars lost at local stations, we don’t see why this bill would cause layoffs. And with NPR’s revenues growing each year by amounts far exceeding the $5 million at stake, it would seem jobs should be safe at the parent company. If you take $5 million and divide by the 8,400 jobs supposedly at risk, you get a salary per person of $595. We’re certain NPR pays better than that. Moran suggested this bill could put every public radio job in America at risk. We rate his claim False.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2011-03-26T07:00:00	2011-03-17	['None']
pomt-12689	"In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/14/donald-trump/trump-says-after-executive-orders-illegal-immigrat/	Illegal immigration from the U.S.-Mexico border dropped significantly during his first full month in office, President Donald Trump said in his first Cabinet meeting. "In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent," Trump said March 13. The Department of Homeland Security recently said there had been a 40 percent drop from January to February 2017 in illegal crossings at the southwest border. How much is Trump to credit for this decline and is it unprecedented? Experts say Trump’s hard-line immigration rhetoric likely played an important role, but other factors are also worth considering. The decline is a significant drop compared with recent years. Southwest border illegal crossings On March 8, DHS Secretary John Kelly described an "unprecedented" decline in illegal southwest border crossings from January to February. Total apprehensions at the southwest border dropped about 44 percent from January (42,504) to February (23,589). Total apprehensions include: - U.S. border patrol apprehensions between ports of entry, and - Inadmissibility determined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations at ports of entry. Specifically, the subset of apprehensions by border patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border decreased about 40 percent, from 31,578 in January to 18,762 in February. CBP historically sees a 10 to 20 percent increase in apprehensions from January to February, Kelly’s statement said. Monthly southwest border apprehension data for fiscal years 2012 to 2016 is available here and shows an uptick in apprehensions from January to February. But apprehensions may increase in coming months, according to DHS. "We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May," Kelly said. "However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact." Trump immigration orders, implementation memos Trump touted declines in illegal immigration along the southern border in the first full month of his administration and referenced directives he signed late January. Among things covered in Trump’s immigration orders and Kelly’s implementation memos: a directive to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall; authorization to hire 15,000 additional employees for immigration enforcement at the border and interior of the country; a stop to the practice of "catch and release," or releasing immigrants caught illegally crossing the border. (Here’s a full recap.) Experts say Trump’s tough-on-immigration rhetoric played an important part in the reduction of illegal border crossings. But they also caution that one month’s worth of data is not enough to make a complete assessment and that other factors should also be considered. "I do think that the election of President Trump is probably the most important factor driving these changes. But it is still very early to have firm conclusions," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. It’s likely that his rhetoric so far has had a stronger effect than his policies, as on-the-ground changes and implementation takes longer, Wilson said. "The Trump administration’s rhetoric and executive orders have created uncertainty for potential migrants and in immigrant communities, and new fears that immigration enforcement will intensify both at the border and in the U.S. interior," said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank researching migration trends and policies. February 2017’s apprehension numbers represent a five-year low, Hipsman said. And the country hasn't seen a 40 percent decline in apprehensions in the last five years. But monthly apprehensions in fiscal year 2011 "were regularly on par with this February’s figures," she said. "The factors driving today’s border crossers — who are now majority Central American — are unchanged," Hipsman noted. "Violence and insecurity still grip the region, poverty has not improved, and there are still tens of thousands of families living apart with some members in the U.S. and in others in Central America with desires to reunify." And while apprehension data is generally used to measure illegal border crossings, past administrations have used both high and low apprehension numbers as an indicator of strong border enforcement, said Donald Kerwin, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank studying international migration and member of a global network of migrant shelters and service centers. "That metric can cut both ways," Kerwin said. Our ruling Trump said, "In the first full month of my administration, following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent." The numbers check out. February apprehensions declined 40 percent. Calling the decline unprecedented is a bit of a stretch, however. And experts warn that one month’s data is not enough to indicate a trend toward lower illegal immigration and that other factors, aside from Trump’s rhetoric and executive orders, should be considered in analyzing apprehension declines. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-09213	On the National Animal Identification System.	half flip	/texas/statements/2010/may/19/todd-staples/staples-voted-once-bill-authorized-another-agency-/	At a Tea Party rally in El Paso on April 15, Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, beefed about the government poking where it doesn't belong. "America's farmers and ranchers have seen firsthand just how quickly a big, intrusive government really can be," said Staples, a Republican who seeks re-election. "And it starts with overzealous environmental lawyers abusing the Endangered Species Act and depriving people of the use of their own property. It includes bureaucrats who try to mandate that you put a $5 microchip in the ear of a $70 goat. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?" Crowd members laughed, but Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee for ag commissioner, later accused Staples of misleading voters about his record on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The federal program aimed to prevent outbreaks of animal disease by tracking individual livestock, or in the case of pigs and poultry, groups of animals, using a radio frequency ear tag with an electronic identification number (as opposed to a microchip inserted into the animal's ear). President George W. Bush's administration started developing the program in 2004 after the discovery in Washington state of a cow infected with mad cow disease — a degenerative brain disorder that can lead to animal deaths and contaminate the food supply. Three cases of infected cows have been identified in the United States, including one in Texas in June 2005. When the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced its timeline for the program in April 2005, livestock owners would have been required to register their "premises" and animals by January 2008 and required to report their animals' movements around the state by 2009. The USDA later changed its mind about that, but in the meantime Texas had taken steps to address the issue of animal ID. Enter Gilbert, who now seeks to remind voters of that history. In a May 13 press release, Gilbert said that no matter what Staples says lately, the record shows he previously supported the NAIS. "He was for it, he voted for it, and he did nothing whatsoever to stop it when he was on the front lines in the (Texas) Senate," Gilbert said. Did Staples flip-flop on the cow chip? Gilbert's campaign pointed to February 2005 legislation revising the state's agriculture code by allowing the Texas Animal Health Commission to develop an animal identification program. To wit: "In order to provide for disease control and enhance the ability to trace disease-infected animals or animals that have been exposed to disease, the commission may develop and implement an animal identification program that is consistent with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Animal Identification System." Minutes of two House hearings show representatives from the Texas Farm Bureau, Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association and the Texas Cattle Feeders Association endorsed the proposal, which sailed through committee and cleared the House with only one vote recorded in opposition. Prior to the Senate vote, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, of which Staples was a member, also heard public testimony. A Burnet rancher was the only witness recorded against the bill, according to a list of people who testified at the hearing. Committee members unanimously advanced the bill to the Senate, though Staples was absent from the hearing and action. Next, it was placed on the Senate's Local and Uncontested Calendar, an indication it had drawn no senatorial objections. Like other proposals on that calendar, it passed with all senators, including Staples, marked as voting "aye." The bill authorized the commission to require livestock owners to pay a fee to register their "premises" with an official ID number by a commission-set deadline. The commission could also tell owners to tag their livestock individually. Finally, the commission was permitted to levy fines for failure to comply. Does that mean, as Gilbert implies, that Texas lawmakers passed a bill that created a mandatory animal ID program? Not exactly. In 2005, responding to the witness who testified against the proposal, Sen. Mike Jackson, R-Pasadena, who carried the measure in the upper chamber, said: "You are aware that this is a permissive bill that says the department may develop a program? It does not say that they shall do it, and the reason that it says that is because the federal government is going to come down here and tell us what to do in another year or two years... that's kind of the premise on why this thing is done." Bill Powers, the commission's governmental relations coordinator, also testified, saying: "What this legislation does is gives the animal health commission the authority to set up and develop a premises and animal identification program so when the federal program becomes mandatory, we're ready to go." In 2006, commission members were poised to vote on the first phase of the program, which required livestock owners to register their premises. They backed off, however, in the face of protests by farmers and ranchers, who said it was an unfair tax. A second phase — never implemented — was to require tagging of individual animals. Meanwhile, the USDA was having problems with the federal animal ID program. In November 2006, the USDA backpedaled on its initiative, making it voluntary only. Farmers and ranchers still objected and this February, the Obama administration scrapped the animal ID program in favor of a new one that would only tag livestock being moved between states. Under the Texas law, the commission could still mandate that livestock owners identify and track their animals. Yet Gene Snelson, the commission's general counsel, told us that it won't act until the USDA defines its new program. And where does that leave Staples, who voted for the law? We sought to interview Staples; he wasn't available. Earlier, Cody McGregor, Staples' campaign manager, said: "Commissioner Staples has stated his opposition to mandatory animal identification as recently as 2009 when he authored a letter to the USDA outlining the burden it would place on the agriculture community and Texas taxpayers." Staples' May 20, 2009, letter to Tom Vilsack, the U.S. secretary of agriculture, states: "I support the voluntary structure of animal identification... mandating animal identification for every animal owner in the United States would certainly have unintended consequences." We found earlier instances of Staples objecting to a mandatory program — all from late 2006, when he was making his first race for ag commissioner. A sample: On Oct. 26, 2006, the ag weekly Country World quoted Staples saying, "I oppose mandatory NAIS, and instead support a true voluntary program that allows for rapid trace back for animal diseases to ensure we maintain an open market for Texas animal products here and abroad." Our judgment? As a senator, Staples voted for a proposal authorizing the state to develop an animal ID program in conjunction with a federal effort that seemed headed toward mandating tags. Significantly, the new law didn't require anyone to tag animals, though it empowered the animal health commission to issue a mandate. But save Staples' 2005 vote, which was in step with nearly every other legislator, he appears to have consistently opposed mandatory identification and tracking — which surely counts for something. Yet Staples' Senate vote counts as well. On the Flip-O-Meter, the contrast between his legislative action and his statements as a candidate and commissioner is a Half Flip.

pomt-12589	"It is unusual" for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/06/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-its-unusual-white-house-officials-susan/	Some Republicans have latched onto allegations about former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to bolster their narrative that President Barack Obama’s administration misused intelligence for political purposes. A few media sources, most prominently Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake, have said Rice repeatedly asked to learn the names of unidentified American citizens who appeared in intelligence reports in connection to the Donald Trump campaign and transition. These reports are based on anonymous sources, and Rice has neither confirmed nor denied them. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Congress should investigate because if the story is true, it’s strange that someone in Rice’s White House position would request for names to be unmasked. "You're right that it's not necessarily illegal," Cotton said in an April 4 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. "It is unusual, though. The White House doesn't conduct criminal investigations. The White House doesn't conduct counterintelligence investigations. The White House is a consumer of intelligence. Normally, those kind of unmasking requests would be done by the agencies responsible for those activities." However, experts in intelligence collection and classified information told us it’s normal for someone in such a high-up national security role to make unmasking requests, and it would be hard, though not impossible, to abuse the practice for political purposes. "It’s not unusual at all," said Joshua Rovner, chair of international politics and national security at Southern Methodist University and author of Fixing the Facts: National Security and the Politics of Intelligence. What ‘unmasking’ is and how it works We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence. The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally "mask" the American’s name, replacing it with something like "U.S. Person." The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the "U.S. Person’s" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports. "The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties," said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy. For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said. Unmasking for political purposes? Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them. But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester. The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group. "It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents," she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse. Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines, compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer. These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said. Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate. But "I have not seen anything in the public record that indicates there is any kind of problem here," she said. Our ruling Cotton said, "It is unusual" for a White House official like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to make unmasking requests. As the president’s top consultant on issues of national security, Rice and other national security advisers consume a large amount of intelligence. There are numerous legitimate reasons why Rice might ask an intelligence agency to reveal the identity of an unnamed person in an intelligence report. It might not be an everyday occurrence, but it is not so "unusual" as to raise suspicion, as Cotton said. We rate Cotton’s claim False.

pomt-11356	"From 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/04/alex-mooney/how-far-has-us-manufacturing-employment-fallen/	There’s no question that manufacturing employment in the United States has fallen in recent decades. But did a Republican congressman from West Virginia get it right when he cited a statistic on that point in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed? U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney wrote March 25 that "from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years." Mooney was broadly accurate when looking at raw employment totals. But the point does not hold up when you factor in population growth — a more telling statistic. (Mooney’s staff did not respond to inquiries for this article.) First, let’s look at the raw numbers. The number of U.S. manufacturing employees bounced around in a fairly narrow range between 1970 and 2000, before plunging between 2000 and 2010. (Left out by Mooney: National manufacturing employment has risen modestly but consistently since 2010.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So that’s in line with what Mooney wrote. But if you adjust for the surge in U.S. population between 1970 and today, the pattern looks different. Rather than "holding steady for 30 years," the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing actually fell consistently between 1970 and 2000. The rate of decline accelerated a bit between 2000 and 2010, but not by much. And the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing has stabilized, and actually increased slightly, since 2010. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed that the pattern depends heavily on which measure you use. "Measured as a percentage of total employment, manufacturing employment has been falling pretty steadily since World War II," he said. "The growth in manufacturing labor productivity, the growth of imported manufactured products as a share of the manufactured goods we consume, and the shift in consumers’ taste away from manufactured goods toward services -- especially health care services -- has meant that we do not need as many U.S. manufacturing employees to produce all the manufactured goods we consume in a given year." We were curious how the pattern looked for West Virginia. It turns out that manufacturing jobs in West Virginia did remain pretty constant prior to 2000 before falling off a cliff. Manufacturing jobs as a percentage of West Virginia’s population held steady between 1990 and 2000, then dropped significantly between 2000 and 2010. As with the other measures, manufacturing employment as a percentage of the state’s population has remained strikingly stable since 2010. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Mooney wrote that "from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years." Mooney’s statistic is accurate in raw numbers. The one caveat is if you measure manufacturing employment as a percentage of the population — which accounts for significant population growth over that period — you can see a steady decline going back decades. Manufacturing’s footprint in the labor market shrank consistently, and by more than half, during the period he cited. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03760	Preventive care coverage under the Affordable Care Act has already "helped Granite Staters save money and live healthier lives."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/apr/05/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-dems-say-obamacare-already-helping-people-save-/	Federal health care reform won’t start in earnest until this autumn, but on the third anniversary of the law that gave us Obamacare, the New Hampshire Democratic Party wanted to make sure that the public knew about all the benefits the law already has produced. In an interestingly worded press release, NHDP Communications Director Harrell Kirstein tallied the gains since 2010. Kirstein began his release by stating "Health care reform has helped Granite Staters save money and live healthier lives." His list of evidence began with a bullet point declaring the Affordable Care Act "Expanded preventative care coverage with no cost-sharing for 365,000 Granite Staters with private health insurance in 2012, including 253,000 women. While more than 160,000 New Hampshire citizen[s] on traditional Medicare also accessed free preventative care services." The numbers Kirstein cites are based on an administration analysis that takes the national level findings of an independent group, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and applies them to various groups of insured people in New Hampshire. Now, Kirstein’s press release made two claims about preventive care; that it helped people save money, and be healthier. But when contacted, Kirstein backpedalled a bit and said his point about preventive care was only that it led to better health, not savings. "I listed a number of provisions that as a collective do help both save money and live healthier lives," Kirstein said. "I apologize if I gave the impression that every bullet point did both things." One of the principles of PolitiFact is words matter. Kirstein wrote about saving money, and his first example describes services that either have no cost-sharing or are free. Both refer to money, and we think it is fair to take the meaning of those words as written, not as explained after the fact. Allowing people to access preventive care with no deductible or co-pay, and therefore save money, is a tenet of the law. "The health care law requires many insurance plans to provide coverage without cost sharing to enrollees for a variety of preventive health services... for all children and adults. The law also makes proven preventive services free for most people on Medicare," according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. At the individual level, provisions within the Affordable Care Act do help some people save money out of their own pockets on preventive care. However, from a system-wide perspective, it’s not so cut and dry. As PolitiFact has noted before, there is a complicated relationship among preventive care, costs and health. The quick assumption that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure can be wrong. When President Obama said "preventive care saves money," PolitiFact ruled that statement False. Obama was speaking about the health care system as a whole, and there’s a lot of evidence that when millions of healthy people use preventive services, their health status remains the same, but all those doctor visits add up to higher costs. A 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that, in some cases, preventive care can save money and improve health. Counseling people to quit smoking, eat a better diet, and giving the most common vaccinations provide a win-win outcome of low cost and avoiding diseases that are expensive to treat. But the authors cautioned "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention, however, are overreaching. Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." "Although some preventive measures do save money, the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not." And whether preventive services lead to better health is also debatable. Preventive services absolutely can make a person healthier when a potential problem is diagnosed early and treated. However, preventive care on a system-wide level leads to batteries of tests and procedures that lead to positive outcomes for a few, but make little difference for many. A study by Danish researchers on the value of annual physicals found that they did little or nothing to reduce the risk of dying from cancer or heart disease. In addition, Ateev Mehrotra at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine estimated the yearly cost of routine physical exams at $8 billion. He said the limited benefits "underline the need to maintain other means of delivering preventive care beyond annual [physicals]." The key finding from all the studies is prevention makes sense when it is targeted. The right strategy picks out the people at risk and offers them the screening or prevention treatment they need. In general, that is the approach in Obamacare. The online journal Health Affairs notes that Section 2713 of the Affordable Care Act is "one of the most straightforward provisions" in the legislation. The law requires services that are backed up by evidence and have been rated by certain bodies, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. "Items and services are rated by the Preventive Services Task Force only with respect to individuals who fit into certain categories determined by age, gender, or medical conditions or risks," the author writes, "and the rule only requires that services be provided to individuals in those categories." Take something as common as cholesterol levels. Under the Task Force guidelines, not everyone would get tested for free; the federal recommendations specify men 35 and older, and women and men of any age with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Even the most targeted regime of preventive services comes with two caveats. By one estimate published in Health Affairs, if 90 percent of Americans took advantage of the most proven services, overall spending would decline by just 0.2 percent. The health benefits would be "huge", but the added doctor visits and tests would cause insurance premiums to rise, by as much at 1.5 percent. At the end of the day, the author writes," increased benefits will be accompanied by increased costs, but neither will be dramatic and an accurate understanding of which will be greater is simply not possible." Our ruling The New Hampshire Democratic Party claimed that health care reform helped people save money and lead healthier lives. Its list began with better access and use of preventive care. The statement brushes over the mixed outcomes of preventive services. They can lead to better health for some, but can also result in batteries of tests that have little health effect for many. Likewise, the Affordable Care Act requires many preventive procedures be offered at no cost to patients, which can save individuals some money, but on a system-wide basis many of those practices are wasteful and they always come at some cost.

pomt-03080	Under Cuccinelli’s tax cut plan, "school divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/27/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-tax-cuts-could-eliminate/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe is sounding alarms that Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s tax cut plan could force a massive layoff of teachers. "School divisions across Virginia could be forced to fire over 8,000 teachers to mask up the shortfall, "McAuliffe declared in a Sept. 12 posting on his website entitled "Virginia Schools in Danger." He has made similar comments on the campaign trail. We wondered if McAuliffe’s statement is accurate. There are slightly more than 100,000 public school teachers in Virginia. McAuliffe is saying his opponent is open to expelling 8 percent of them in favor of cut taxes. In May, Cuccinelli announced a plan to slice the top personal income tax bracket from 5.75 to 5 percent and the corporate income tax rate 6 percent to 4 percent. After they’re fully implemented over four years, the cuts would reduce general fund revenues by $1.4 billion annually. Cuccinelli said he would offset the loss by eliminating tax loopholes and exemptions and limiting the increase in new spending. McAuliffe’s math McAuliffe arrived at his layoff figure by extrapolating numbers in report critical of Cuccinelli’s tax plan by the Virginia Education Association, an organization representing more than 60,000 teachers. The group has endorsed McAuliffe for governor. During this budget year, which began July 1, the state will spend just under 30 percent of its general fund dollars on public schools. About $5.3 billion of the $17.6 billion fund has been appropriated for K-12 education. Cuccinelli’s $1.4 billion tax cut comes to just 8 percent of the current general fund. The VEA assumed that all major programs in the general fund -- mostly education, health and public safety -- would be cut by 8 percent to pay for Cuccinelli’s tax plan. That would come to about a $420 million reduction for education. The average salary and benefits total for a teacher is $64,635, the VEA said, so a $420 million loss would amount to losing support for about 6,530 teachers. McAuliffe posted these findings on Facebook. But McAuliffe’s campaign didn’t stop there. It ran its own numbers with an assumption that education would be cut more than other general fund programs. For example, Medicaid has been taking a growing share of the general fund budget -- 21 percent in fiscal year 2012. Because it’s an entitlement program, it would be very difficult to cut, the campaign says. McAuliffe’s advisers pointed to several other general fund programs that they said are locked in or difficult to cut, such as debt service and money for the judicial and legislative branches. When these programs are taken off the table, the campaign says education comprised 37.5 percent of the remaining general fund. So McAuliffe’s people concluded that Cuccinelli might have to rely on education to pay for 37.5 percent of his $1.4 billion tax cuts. That comes out to $525 million. And when they divided $525 million by the average salary and benefits cost for a teacher, they came up with 8,122 teachers who could be laid off. Problems with McAuliffe’s formula Cuccinelli says he is not contemplating cutting education and has denounced his opponent for making a "false and misleading" attack. Despite all the assumptions McAuliffe built into his estimate, he ignored Cuccinelli’s important pledge to offset the cost of the tax cut by eliminating some tax loopholes and cap the growth in state spending. McAuliffe’s campaign is cynical about the pledge, accurately noting that Cuccinelli has declined to identify a single loophole he’d be willing to close. Cuccinelli says he would appoint a commission to rank tax exemptions in order of their effectiveness and urge the General Assembly to repeal the worst ones. There may be plenty of slack in Virginia’s loopholes. A report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission valued the exemptions allowed in 2008 at $12.5 billion. That almost equals the $14.3 billion in general fund taxes the state collected that year. Most of the exemptions were approved for tax policy reasons, such as conforming certain Virginia tax laws to federal codes or weeding out inconsistencies that could lead to double taxation, according to the report. But JLARC also found that about $2.9 billion of the breaks were designed to promote public policies, such as helping the coal industry or encouraging land preservation. Many of these, JLARC said, could be easily eliminated or streamlined "without undermining principles of sound tax policy." McAuliffe’s estimate also ignores revenue offsets that would come from Cuccinelli’s policy of capping spending increases to the combined annual rises in Virginia’s rates of inflation and population growth. Last year, the general fund budget grew by 5.8 percent while the combined rates of inflation and population growth expanded by 3.3 percent. Had Cuccinelli’s cap been in effect, the state would have spent about about $415 million less. There’s one last important point that McAuliffe also ignored: Cuccinelli has promised he would abandon his tax cuts if he and the General Assembly cannot agree on a way offset their costs. "If I don’t succeed in reining in government growth and if I don’t succeed in getting the exemptions and loopholes identified to pay for the tax cuts, we don’t get the tax cuts," Cuccinelli said during a July 20 debate with McAuliffe. Our ruling McAuliffe says that under Cuccinelli’s tax cut plan, "school divisions across Virginia could be force to fire over 8,000 teachers." The claim is based on assumptions that ignore Cuccinelli’s promise to offset the $1.4 billion cost of his tax cut by closing tax loopholes and capping the increase of future spending. Cuccinelli has frustrated many by refusing to name any tax exemptions he would eliminate. But a state auditing commission has said the $12 billion or so in tax breaks given by the state each year is fertile ground to find savings. McAuliffe seeks cover for his statement by saying the layoffs "could" happen. That overlooks Cuccinelli’s pledge that he’ll abandon the tax cuts if the legislature is unwilling to pay for them by ending loopholes and limiting spending increases. So McAuliffe’s doomsday estimate only works by twisting Cuccinelli’s plan into an unrecognizable shape. We rate his statement False.

pomt-09237	The president can "authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen who fights for a foreign terrorist organization."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/11/joe-lieberman/lieberman-says-president-can-approve-killing-us-ci/	On May 6, 2010, Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., joined three fellow lawmakers -- two Republicans and one Democrat -- to propose the Terrorist Expatriation Act, which would allow the United States to revoke the citizenship of an American citizen who affiliates with an officially designated foreign terrorist organization. In comments at a news conference -- later aired on the May 9, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week -- Lieberman cited a paradox to make the case for the bill. He cited news reports that President Barack Obama had authorized the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born extremist Muslim cleric who is believed to be hiding in Yemen. U.S. intelligence sources have reportedly linked al-Awlaki to an al-Qaida affiliate and say he has recruited new terrorists. The paradox, Lieberman said, is that while it is legal for the U.S. to kill al-Awlaki, it is is not legal for the U.S. to impose a more limited sanction -- the removal of citizenship. "As many of you know, it has been reported that President Obama has signed an order authorizing the assassination of al-Awlaki," Lieberman said. "That has not been confirmed, but no one argues that a president doesn't have the right to issue such an order. If the president can authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen who fights for a foreign terrorist organization -- in this case al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- we can also have a law that allows the U.S. government to revoke al-Awlaki's citizenship." We won't delve into the question of whether passing Lieberman's bill is a good idea, since that's in the realm of opinion, but we did think it worthwhile to examine the factual premise of Lieberman's claim -- that the president can "authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen who fights for a foreign terrorist organization." We'll address the question on two levels. First, does the administration believe it has this power? And second, is the administration's legal justification for such targeting solid and widely recognized? The first question is relatively straightforward. Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair has testified to Congress that if intelligence officials believe there's a need to kill an American citizen operating with a terrorist organization, a process exists to authorize such an action. "We take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community," Blair told the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 3, 2010. "If ... we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that." Under questioning from the panel's ranking Republican, Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, Blair declined to discuss details about the process of approving the targeting of an American citizen. "Primarily it has to do with ... whether that American is involved in a group that is trying to attack us, whether that American is a threat to other Americans," Blair told the committee. News reports, citing unnamed administration officials, have offered conflicting details about what steps are taken during the approval process. (On This Week, Attorney General Eric Holder said, "Well, I'm not going to assume that what has been said there about ordering anybody's assassination is necessarily true.") Also unconfirmed, but widely suspected, is the specific targeting of al-Awlaki under these rules. On April 6, 2010, the New York Times, citing "intelligence and counterterrorism officials," reported that he had been, but no administration official has publicly confirmed that. Still, despite uncertainty about the details, Blair's comments have widely been understood as confirmation that the Obama administration stands ready to kill terrorist-affiliated U.S. citizens overseas. The answer to the second question -- whether the White House's position is legally supportable -- is more in dispute. On the one hand, legal experts told us it's permissible to kill someone engaged in battle against the United States, even if that person is an American citizen. Such killings have occurred in contexts as varied as the Civil War and the Cold War, based on powers vested in Article II of the Constitution (which makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces) and upheld by the 1866 Supreme Court decision Ex Parte Milligan (which confirms that "command of the forces and the conduct of campaigns" rests with the president). International law does pose some limits; the 1907 Hague Convention, for instance, prohibits combat tactics that cause "unnecessary suffering." And in the 1970s, President Gerald Ford issued an executive order banning the CIA from any involvement in assassinations. But targeted killings of the kind Lieberman is referring to are considered exempt from that executive order, and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush signed what's known as an "intelligence finding" that enabled the CIA to pursue terrorists around the world. Congress gave its consent as well. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress passed an "Authorization to Use Military Force," a measure short of a formal declaration of war but carrying essentially the same authority. In it, Congress explicitly gave the president the power to "use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." Meanwhile, in 2006, Bush reportedly expanded the 2001 "finding" beyond al-Qaida and Afghanistan. Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said that "since terrorists qualify as combatants, the president can use deadly force, if necessary, to stop a terrorist. The ability to use force against such combatant is not affected by his or her citizenship. In World War II, if an American citizen chose to fight for Germany or Japan, he or she would still have been a legitimate target as an enemy combatant." At the same time, however, the post-Sept. 11 world has added some complications. One is that it's often not easy to determine whether an individual has taken up the fight against the United States, since there is no regularized, uniformed army to join. It's hard to determine "whether we are really in a war with al-Qaida in the legal sense," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. "Our government assumes so, but not all countries buy that argument, because it's neither a war between states nor a typical civil war." Another problem is one of geography. In past wars, the battle lines were fairly straightforward. But when facing terrorist attacks, virtually anyplace can become a battlefield. "It's pretty clear that if you have an American citizen on a traditional battlefield shooting Howitzers at American forces, you can take the guy out," said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. "On the other hand, you have the 1957 Supreme Court decision Reid vs. Covert, which ruled that American citizens take their constitutional rights wherever they go. So in the case of someone like al-Awlaki, do you consider Pakistan to be part of the battlefield? If you do, it looks like a pretty comfortable call. If you don't, you could object that you're depriving a citizen of their life without due process." Some scholars argue that the kinds of attacks discussed by Lieberman are clearly illegal because of their location away from a battlefield. "The fighting or hostilities of an armed conflict occurs within limited zones, referred to as combat or conflict zones," University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell said during congressional testimony in April. "It is only in such zones that killing enemy combatants or those taking a direct part in hostilities is permissible. Because armed conflict requires a certain intensity of fighting, the isolated terrorist attack, regardless of how serious the consequences, is not an armed conflict." Others express a more nuanced view. In the same hearing as the one where O'Connell testified, William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor, told lawmakers that while the current legal framework is imperfect and merits updating to keep up with the changing nature of terrorism-related combat, it does provide justification for the sorts of killings Lieberman is referring to. "The president’s intelligence finding does not make any exception for Americans," Banks testified, adding that "the defensive use of force — targeted at a known al-Qaida leader, for example — also has firm legal roots in customary international law." To recap, the Obama administration has not only claimed the authority to target and kill U.S. citizens linked to terrorist groups but may in fact be using that power already to target al-Awlaki. Many of our experts see ample justification for such actions in both domestic and international law, and both for political reasons and practical legal reasons (including finding someone with standing to file a court challenge) the president is unlikely to be curbed by the courts anytime soon. Still, even those who see strong arguments for this presidential prerogative acknowledge that a number of legal uncertainties could limit or undermine those powers in the future if court challenges were to be raised. So Lieberman is probably overstating his case when he says that "no one argues that a president doesn't have the right to issue such an order," but we still find his statement Mostly True.

pomt-10452	The Rev. Wright compared "the United States Marine Corps with Roman legionnaires who were responsible for the death of our Savior."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/30/john-mccain/wrights-culture-of-war-comparison/	After avoiding the controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his volatile sermons, Sen. John McCain decided April 27 to speak up. In a news conference in Coral Gables, Fla., McCain said: "I saw yesterday some additional comments that have been revealed by Pastor Wright, one of them comparing the United States Marine Corps with Roman legionnaires who were responsible for the death of our Savior. I mean being involved in that — it's beyond belief." McCain's account of Wright's statements was widely reported in the media, but was it accurate? It was a long sermon Wright gave on April 13, 2003, one made famous for his saying "God damn America." For us, the relevant part, on which McCain based his statement, was this: "These people had ... an occupying army living in their country. Jesus ... calls them their enemies." "Their enemies had all the political power," Wright said. "Remember, they had to send Jesus to a court presided over by the enemy. A provisional governor appointed by the enemies ran the civic and the political affairs of their capital. He had backing him up an occupying army with superior soldiers. They were commandos trained in urban combat and trained to kill on command. "Remember, it was soldiers of the 3rd Marine Regiment of Rome who had fun with Jesus, who was mistreated as a prisoner of war, an enemy of the occupying army stationed in Jerusalem to ensure the mopping up action of Operation Israeli Freedom. These people were blinded by the culture of war." It should be noted that there was no 3rd Marine Regiment of the Roman army. The 3rd Marine Regiment is an infantry regiment of the United States Marine Corps. One could argue Wright was simply putting a modern analogy on a biblical account — that he was saying it was the Roman version of our 3rd Marine Regiment. One could also argue that the Rev. Wright, a former Marine, was subtly drawing parallels between those Roman soldiers and the modern American military. Parsing the words of a preacher is tricky business. Bill J. Leonard, dean of the Divinity School and professor of church history at Wake Forest University, said the sermon is an illustration of a rhetorical device — common to many African-American and Southern preachers, and used by Wright extensively — called a "Jeremiad." Webster's defines it as "a prolonged lamentation or complaint" or "a cautionary or angry harangue." Said Leonard: "If you start making it literal and pressing it on public issues, you are missing some of the point." Leonard believes Wright is making reference to Abu Ghraib, where some U.S. Army military police abused and humiliated Iraqi prisoners. The whole point of such a sermon is to be provocative, Leonard said. And good preachers hold their parishioners — and nations — accountable, he said. In a speech before the National Press Club on April 28, Wright said much of the criticism of his sermons amounted to an attack on the black church. "Black preaching is different from European and European-American preaching," Wright said. "It is not deficient; it is just different. It is not bombastic; it is not controversial; it's different." Since we're parsing Wright's words, let's parse McCain's too. He said Wright "compared" the Marines to Roman soldiers who persecuted Christ. One could certainly argue whether it is fair or appropriate to draw any parallels between U.S. soldiers and those Roman soldiers, or to what degree Wright was suggesting that they similar. McCain's recounting of Wright's statement seems an attempt to maximize the issue for sensational effect, but it certainly seems to us, based on Wright's interchanging modern language with the biblical tale, that he at least wanted his parishioners to consider a comparison of the two. We give it a Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-04-30T00:00:00	2008-04-27	['United_States_Marine_Corps']
pomt-13400	Says Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine "want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-say-hillary-clinton-wants-shut-/	The weekend before the first presidential debate, Donald Trump went to Roanoke, Va., to talk about energy. "Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy and on our miners. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work," Trump said. "Clinton and (vice presidential candidate Tim) Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. What they've done is incredible." Shale has become a dominant source of fossil fuels in the United States, thanks to a controversial process known as fracking. It wrings natural gas out of bedrock in a process that was once not considered profitable for extracting oil or natural gas. The process is efficient enough that the country's dependence on petroleum imports has declined precipitously. We wondered if the Clinton team wants to shut down fracking and the natural gas it produces. Trump's evidence Natural gas, composed mostly of methane, is extracted from shale rock by injecting it with pressurized water, sand and chemicals. Supporters note that burning it produces far less pollution than other types of fossil fuel. Critics say the process can cause earthquakes, water contamination and the unwanted release of methane, a gas renowned for trapping heat, which makes it a big player in climate change. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Jeff Wood sent us to a transcript of the March 6, 2016, Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., where Clinton and her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, were asked about fracking. Sanders said he opposed it unconditionally. Clinton, who had come under fire by Sanders for her support of the technology, was less absolute. "I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, number one," Clinton told the crowd. "I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — number three — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using." "So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place," she continued. "And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated. So first, we’ve got to regulate everything that is currently underway, and we have to have a system in place that prevents further fracking unless conditions like the ones that I just mentioned are met." When we looked at this issue previously, we found evidence that Clinton had been supportive of fracking as secretary of state. She promoted it for Latin America, China, India and the European Union. In a 2009 speech, Clinton said: "Now, I know that in some places it's controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources." She did, however, call for "smart regulations" on the practice. In an April debate against Sanders in Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton was asked about her past statements as secretary of state. Clinton characterized natural gas as a "bridge" between dirty fuels, such as coal, and clean renewable energy, and said she was promoting it to other countries as a way to get European countries away from Russian sources. "So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can," she said. Shut down fracking? Only a minority of states have banned fracking. Vermont was the first in 2012 and New York followed in 2014. Maryland has a moratorium on the practice through next year. Some municipalities have banned it as well. As for places with the unwanted release of methane — known as "fugitive emissions" — a 2015 study found that would apply to roughly one in 25 facilities. On the issue of water pollution, fracking critic Robert Howarth of Cornell University has estimated that 4 percent of production wells pollute water. And a 2015 EPA study said there were 151 cases of fracking spills in 11 states between 2006 and 2012.. When it comes to disclosing the chemicals used in the process, the impact of Clinton's rules would not be large. According to the American Chemical Society, 26 of the 28 states where fracking is done already have some disclosure rules, although those rules may not provide complete disclosure because they often drilling companies to protect what are regarded as trade secrets. It seems likely that if Clinton's ideas were put in place, drillers in the remaining two states could simply disclose the ingredients of their fracking solution the way drillers in other states have. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Trump's allegation, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to her campaign website and this statement: "Switching to natural gas has avoided thousands of premature deaths and more than 100,000 asthma attacks by improving air quality, while creating good paying jobs and careers and helping reduce U.S. carbon pollution to its lowest level in 20 years," Clinton is quoted as saying. "With strong safeguards in place, natural gas can play an important role in our transition to a clean energy economy . . . As President, I will ensure natural gas production is safe and responsible in those communities that choose to pursue it." The Clinton campaign said she and Kaine agree on fracking and natural gas. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton and Kaine "want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas." Trump's campaign points to Clinton's statements that she wants to put restrictions on the fracking process used to extract natural gas from shale, and she wants to move the world away from petroleum sources as quickly as possible. But a review of Clinton's statements also make clear that she supports natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil. Her restrictions would not shut down fracking or natural gas production. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/17249e35-e2f6-4360-87a7-f75aadf95c06	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-25T20:09:10	2016-09-24	['None']
pomt-08224	"Nobody has played clips over and over ... of President Obama (saying), 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun.' "	true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/17/joyce-kaufman/radio-host-joyce-kaufman-said-obama-tote-gun/	All that talk about complicated matters such as Social Security and deficits and tax brackets can get a little wonky in the midst of campaigns and the post-election season. So it's not that unusual for a candidate, a politician -- or a talk show host -- to hammer home a point with a touch of violent rhetoric. And when a political figure mixes talk about elections or policy with words about war, battles or weapons, it certainly draws attention -- and sometimes controversy. We'll walk you through such a controversy that involves three political figures -- a Democratic president, a conservative South Florida talk show host, and a fiery talking newly elected Republican congressman -- and a slew of words that relate to violence (bullets, guns, knives). And we'll mix in a popular movie. Joyce Kaufman, a South Florida conservative radio talk show host on WFTL-850 AM, garnered national attention after newly elected U.S. Rep. Allen West hired her as his chief of staff a week after the Nov. 2, 2010, election. West is the Republican who ousted U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, the two-term Democrat who represents Congressional District 22, which spans parts of coastal and suburban Broward and Palm Beach counties. On Nov. 9, the day after West announced he had hired Kaufman, MSNBC liberal commentator Rachel Maddow's 9 p.m. show had a piece that included a clip of Kaufman at a July 3, 2010, rally in Broward County in which she said: "I don’t care how this gets painted by the mainstream media, I don’t care if this shows up on YouTube, because I am convinced that the most important thing the Founding Fathers did to ensure me my First Amendment rights was they gave me a Second Amendment. And if ballots don’t work, bullets will." The Second Amendment, remember, is the right to keep and bear arms. Early in the morning Nov. 10, someone sent an e-mail to Kaufman that stated: "I'm planning something big around the government building here in Broward County, maybe a post office, maybe even a school. ..." The threat led to a lockdown of Broward schools Nov. 10 and an FBI investigation that remains open. By Nov. 11, Kaufman announced that she was stepping down from her chief of staff post because she didn't want to tarnish West. She took to the airwaves to discuss her decision, her vows to take out other Democrats in Congress, and to bash the media. On her radio show Nov. 12, Kaufman suggested she isn't the only political player to use rhetoric that some could interpret as inciting violence. "Nobody has played clips over and over again on the FOX (News network), which is supposed to be fair and balanced, of President (Barack) Obama said, 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun,' " Kaufman said. "I've never heard that clip played. We all know it was said. Did the cow play that? No. Of course not. Because we knew what he meant. These are metaphors, these are ways of stating in large terms simple facts. President Obama was saying if they try to fight us and pick at us with amendments we will come at them with legislation. And that's what he did. I knew that’s what he meant." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to check Kaufman's claim that Obama said "If they bring a knife to the fight, we'll bring a gun." We'll also explain the cow reference. A simple Google search of the words "Barack Obama", "knife" and "gun" turned up several hits. A June 14, 2008, article from Politico stated that Republicans were pouncing on this comment from Obama reported by the press pool: " 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,' Obama said in Philadelphia last night. 'Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I’ve seen Eagles fans.' " We found the same quote June 14, 2008, in the Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire blog. Obama was quoting from the 1987 movie The Untouchables about gangster Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro) and the efforts of government agent Eliot Ness (played by Kevin Costner) to bring down Capone during Prohibition in Chicago. The trailer on YouTube contains the quote that Obama borrowed -- muttered by actor Sean Connery playing cop Jimmy Malone -- in a sinister voice: "You want to get Capone? Here is how you get him. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That is the Chicago way." We also found a June 23, 2008, article in the Chicago Tribune, which stated that Obama meant the line delivered at the Philadelphia fundraiser as a joke. We obtained Kaufman's quotes about Obama by listening to her noon-3 p.m. Nov. 12 show. Typically PolitiFact Florida provides links to a transcript of the show itself so that readers can see or hear the quotes directly from the source. But Steve Lapa, the station's vice president and general manager, said that WFTL does not provide a transcript or archive her show. In a telephone interview Nov. 15, we read Kaufman's quotes back to her to verify that we're quoting her accurately. "I don't know,'' she said. "I'm taking your word for it. It sounds plausible." But Kaufman had a couple of tweaks: She said she thought Obama made the remarks during his 2008 campaign -- which he did. "I'm not so sure he was talking about legislation and amendments in straight-forward terms,'' she said. "He was talking about the arena of ideas." Kaufman said her point was that Obama was using a metaphor, and the media treated his statement about a gun differently than her remark about bullets. "Nobody thought he was going to bring a gun,'' she said. "My goal certainly wasn't to incite violence. .... I was encouraging people to go out and use their vote." Here is a longer video of Kaufman's now-famous ballots and bullets speech on the Post on Politics, a blog of the Palm Beach Post. OK, now about that cow reference. Speaking of the Obama quote, Kaufman said: "Did the cow play that? No. Of course not." Kaufman told us that her reference to "the cow" was about Maddow -- the MSNBC commentator who played the clip of Kaufman. "I endearingly call her Rachel Mad-cow," Kaufman said. For this Truth-O-Meter, our goal was to evaluate whether Obama said "if they bring a knife to the fight we'll bring a gun," as Kaufman claimed. We found several news articles quoting Obama as saying exactly that and he's never denied it (though the Chicago Tribune said it was meant as a joke). We rate this claim True.

pomt-04310	Says Barack Obama "sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China" at the cost of American jobs.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/30/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-obama-chrysler-sold-italians-china-ame/	With Ohio’s 18 electoral votes very much in play, the Mitt Romney campaign aims to blunt one of Barack Obama’s key advantages in that state -- his rescue of the auto industry. The carmakers account for about one out of eight jobs there, and many Ohio assembly line workers are backing Obama for a second term. The Romney campaign has produced a controversial ad that argues Romney would be better for the auto industry than Obama. In the ad, an announcer says, "Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job." Images of cars being crushed accompany those words. The not-so-subtle message is that American workers have suffered from the Chrysler deal. In this fact check, we examine whether the sale of Chrysler came at the cost of American jobs. How Fiat got Chrysler By early 2008, it was clear that GM and Chrysler were teetering. Both firms had huge debts and high costs. The recession had slowed car sales to a trickle. Chrysler’s owner, Cerberus Capital Management, was hunting for a buyer and had been talking to Italian carmaker Fiat. In late 2008, President George W. Bush approved billion dollar loans to the companies to keep them afloat. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took the oath of office, Fiat announced it was interested in buying Chrysler. Obama created an auto task force and in March, the task force told Chrysler to cut a deal with Fiat or be cut off from further government loans. In early April, Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and at the same time, announced an alliance with Fiat. By the end of April, the terms of the deal were complete and by June, it was finalized. Cerberus Capital had lost its stake, and Fiat held 20 percent of the new Chrysler and had full operational control. Steve Rattner, chair of the president’s auto task force, said Fiat was essential to Chrysler’s survival. "If we had been unable to strike this arrangement with Fiat, I believe that we would have allowed Chrysler to liquidate. So it was a great outcome for all concerned," Rattner said. Aaron Bragman, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive, a financial research group, said the government couldn’t sell Chrysler because it never owned it. In fact, the auto industry and Chrysler were in such bad shape, this wasn’t a sale at all in the conventional sense. "Fiat paid nothing for Chrysler," Bragman said, but "they poured MASSIVE resources into the company, such as design help, executive staff and personnel, joint development, engine technology, all sorts of non-cash things that helped Chrysler recover considerably." Chrysler is now profitable. Laid-off union workers have been rehired, and the company is adding new personnel. Fiat, Jeeps, and China When Fiat got Chrysler, it got Jeep. Right before the ad came out, Romney told a crowd in Defiance, Ohio, that plans were afoot to shift the Jeep jobs in Ohio to China. "I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state Jeep — now owned by the Italians — is thinking of moving all production to China," Romney said. Romney had been working off an article from Bloomberg News about Fiat’s discussions to start making Jeeps again in China. The old Chrysler had assembly plants in China, but they had been idle since 2009. Romney’s words drew an immediate and firm denial from Chrysler headquarters. "Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China," the statement said. "A careful and unbiased reading of the Bloomberg take would have saved unnecessary fantasies and extravagant comments." Bragman, the auto analyst, said Romney’s notion that expansion in China comes at a cost to American workers runs counter to the facts. Chrysler’s Toledo plant is running at full capacity, and its Detroit plant is at three shifts. Chrysler is building cars in the United States for sale here. The production of cars in China is a sign of Chrysler's growing strength in overseas markets. It would like to build Jeeps in China to sell in China. It is not outsourcing American auto jobs. "I'm astonished that more people aren't thrilled by the fact that an American company on the brink of literal oblivion has come back strong enough to now once again be making and selling its products in the hottest auto market in the world," Bragman said. "It is a phenomenal success story, quite frankly, and one that has sadly been bizarrely twisted out of shape for political expediency." Our ruling The Romney campaign ad says Obama "sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China" at the cost of American jobs. The ad leaves the clear impression that Jeeps built in China come at the expense of American workers. The ad miscasts the government’s role in Fiat’s acquisition of Chrysler, and it misrepresents the outcome. Chrysler’s owners had been trying to sell to Italy-based Fiat before Obama took office. The ad ignores the return of American jobs to Chrysler Jeep plants in the United States, and it presents the manufacture of Jeeps in China as a threat, rather than an opportunity to sell cars made in China to Chinese consumers. It strings together facts in a way that presents an wholly inaccurate picture. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-04907	"The president’s health care law raids Medicare by more than $500 billion and creates a Medicare rationing board — a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats — to slow the growth of Medicare spending."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/03/scott-garrett/scott-garrett-claims-affordable-care-act-raidts-me/	For U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett, there is one way forward on health care: Congress must fully repeal the federal law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court this summer. But to support that position the Republican congressman relies on some questionable facts. "Even without the weight of this act, Medicare and Medicaid are already on the path to bankruptcy. With the Health Care Act, the situation is even worse. The president’s health care law raids Medicare by more than $500 billion and creates a Medicare rationing board — a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats — to slow the growth of Medicare spending," Garrett wrote in a July 29 opinion column published on NorthJersey.com. Here, we’ll assess Garrett’s claims about the law’s impact on Medicare funding and spending. In June, PolitiFact New Jersey gave Republican U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan a Mostly False for saying there are "$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation." Garrett repeats that misleading talking point about the law, formally named the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but often called ObamaCare. Medicare spending will continue to increase, just at a slower pace. Because of changes in the law, growth in Medicare spending over 10 years will be more than $500 billion less than had been projected, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That reduction -- the biggest portion of which comes from cutting annual increases in Medicare payments to medical providers -- will help offset other costs in the law. Still, over the same decade, Medicare spending will increase. Garrett also said in his column that the health care law creates a "Medicare rationing board" of "15 unelected bureaucrats" to "slow the growth of Medicare spending." Though there is some truth to that statement, it needs significant clarification. Specifically, the board is restricted from making any recommendations to ration care. The health care law creates an Independent Payment Advisory Board with 15 members, who are appointed and must have expertise in health care.. The board -- a controversial provision of the law -- was formed in response to national criticism that legislators have been unable to rein in Medicare costs. The group will offer recommendations to prevent Medicare spending from surpassing certain levels. If Congress fails to act on the board’s proposals, its changes are automatically implemented. But the law forbids the board from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," including raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increasing deductibles. The board also can’t change Medicare eligibility requirements, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. But it can decrease government payments to health care providers for services and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending. As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, some may argue that since the board can reduce the money doctors receive for giving certain treatments to Medicare patients, its decisions could result in an indirect form of rationing. But the law clearly forbids the board from directly rationing care. Our ruling Garrett said that the "president’s health care law raids Medicare by more than $500 billion and creates a Medicare rationing board — a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats — to slow the growth of Medicare spending." The national health care law does not cut funding for Medicare, though it does decrease projections for future spending growth. Spending on the program will continue to grow, but at a slower pace. The law does create a 15-member board to prevent Medicare spending from exceeding certain growth targets, but the board is specifically forbidden from proposing any plans to ration care.

pomt-15156	"In 1940, only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/	Curt Schilling, the baseball pitcher and ESPN commentator, normally tweets about baseball, the Bible and members of the armed services. But on Aug. 25, he lobbed a different message into the twittersphere. Schilling passed along a graphic to his 133,000 followers that had a photo of Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute. The image had two lines. "It’s said that only 5-10% of Muslims are extremists. "In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. How’d that go?" Schilling quickly found himself suspended from commentary duties by ESPN. He retracted the tweet and wrote, "I understand and accept my suspension. 100% my fault. Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part." Still, many readers asked us to assess his claim. The point of the graphic is opaque, and its logic faces some logical stumbling blocks. Muslim extremists are non-state actors, while German Nazis were fighting for the German nation. And as Vox pointed out, Muslim extremists primarily kill other Muslims, while Germans signed on to subjugate or kill non-Germans, Jews, gays, and political opponents of any stripe. These are not insignificant differences. Regarding extremist Muslims, we’ve examined before the challenge of identifying, much less counting them. If counting armed jihadists is your standard, then a 2014 estimate done for the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, the follow-on group to the 9-11 Commission, suggests there are about 100,000. Out of a worldwide Muslim population of about 945 million, that’s about a hundredth of a percent. But beyond actual fighters, the definition can rest in the eye of the beholder. The kind of numbers thrown around in the tweet would include Muslims who might endorse some fundamentalist principles but not all. You won’t find reliable numbers because the definition is vague and the data are too limited. That loose standard for Muslim extremists stands in sharp contrast to the numbers behind the claim about Germans, our focus in this fact-check. The statistic that in 1940, only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis seems to rely on a very narrow definition of who was a Nazi. If it has any accuracy, it counts only Germans who formally joined the party, which excludes a much larger number who were supporters. In his book The Nazi Party 1919-1945: A complete history, Dietrich Orlow wrote that early in the war, membership in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (the full name of the Nazi party) surged to about 6.5 million. Georg Fertig is a professor of economic history and specialist in historical demography at Halle University in Germany. Fertig told us the 6.5 million figure is based on sound sources. Fertig and a large team of economic and social historians recently collected historical data on Germany going back to 1834. It shows that in 1940, there were about 69.8 million Germans. That would mean party members represented about 9 percent of the total. That’s not too much different from Schilling’s figure. But party membership was for adults, not children. In 1939, Germany had about 52 million people over 15. In that light, formal Nazi party members represented about 12 percent of the relevant population. However, the wrinkles don’t stop there. By 1940, Germany had annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, so defining the German population base gets dicey. If party membership was the be-all and end-all of defining Nazi supporters, the claim would be in fine shape. But the reality is far from that simple. For starters, in the last totally free elections in Germany in 1932, the Nazi party beat out every other party, winning about 33 percent of the vote and taking control of the parliament, or Reichstag. That election put Hitler on his path to running the country. (In presidential elections earlier in the year, Hitler did not do as well.) Fertig said the Reichstag vote is an inexact yardstick for German support, although it captures some level of popular sympathy for the Nazi agenda. After 1933, Germany was a totalitarian state, and voting was either coerced or nonexistent. Thomas Kuehne is a professor of history and director of Holocaust and genocide graduate studies at Clark University. Kuehne told PunditFact that it is difficult to define with certainty who was a Nazi. Formal membership in the party was just one measure. Kuehne said the general consensus among historians is that the regime’s popularity peaked around 1940 thanks to the rapid German victories known as Blitzkrieg. He sees the winning percentage of 33 percent in 1932 as a useful benchmark. "There is no reason to assume that this share decreased before, say, late 1944," Kuehne said. "The 7 percent figure is totally misleading." But even with that, both experts cautioned that it is notoriously difficult to put hard numbers to the question of which Germans would call themselves a Nazi. Our ruling Schilling tweeted that in 1940 only 7 percent of Germans were Nazis. That figure is too low. It might be close for the more limited fraction of Nazi supporters who formally joined the party, but it ignores the Nazis’ electoral domination in 1932 and the popularity that came after the first military victories in 1939. The vote results and the assessment of the experts we reached point to a much larger figure in the range of 35 percent. That’s five times larger than the figure in the tweet. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Curt Schilling	None	None	None	2015-08-28T14:28:57	2015-08-25	['Nazism']
pomt-13664	"Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014 ... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity."	true	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/04/richard-durbin/40-percent-drug-overdose-deaths-involve-heroin/	U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has been one of the most vocal members in Congress in the fight against the growing heroin and opioid epidemic in Illinois and across the country. Durbin has introduced a handful of measures to expand and improve access to treatment programs for heroin addiction, as well as legislation that would curtail the amount of prescription opioid medication on the market. In a July 20 press release discussing new initiatives to combat heroin and prescription opioid addiction, Durbin highlighted some startling statistics to hammer home just how big a problem opioid abuse has become in Illinois: "Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity." Those are some pretty shocking numbers and there are a lot of them, so we wanted to take a closer look. Drug overdose deaths in Illinois Durbin’s press secretary John Normoyle said in an email the senator was using overdose statistics provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that the figures cited came from a provisional report for 2014 and the number of drug overdose deaths were not revised to reflect the most recent count. Data on drug overdose deaths is readily available on the CDC website, which shows there were a total of 1,705 drug overdose deaths in 2014, compared to 1,288 in 2010 -- a 32.4 percent increase over that four-year period. However, the Illinois Department of Public Health, which reports preliminary and final drug overdose deaths to the CDC, puts the 2010 total at 1,284 and 1,700 in 2014 -- a slight discrepancy but not unusual when reporting overdose deaths as they often get revised. For that reason, Divya Little, a public information officer at IDPH, said the state’s finalized data is more accurate, though the difference is negligible with regard to some of the other statistics presented in Durbin’s claim. Of the roughly 1,700 drug overdose deaths, 711 were heroin-related, accounting for nearly 42 percent of all drug overdose deaths in 2014. While the percentage of drug overdose deaths associated with heroin would be a little more than 1 percentage point higher using the provisional 1,652 figure, Normoyle said the 40 percent statistic was pulled from a Reboot Illinois article that uses final data for 2014. It’s important to note that prior to 2013, counties did not specifically test for heroin in overdose deaths, so tracking deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined, according to IDPH. Durbin’s use of outdated numbers from the CDC neither misleads nor drastically alters the claim. If anything, it helps Durbin in making his point that heroin and prescription opioid abuse and addiction continues to get worse. Dwindling state-funded treatment capacity A report published in August 2015 by the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy at Roosevelt University, or ICDP, shows state-funded treatment capacity in Illinois fell by 52 percent from 2007-2012, the largest decrease in the nation. Durbin, who used statistics from this study, is correct when he says Illinois led the nation in the decline for state-funded treatment capacity. In 2007, Illinois ranked 28th in state-funded treatment capacity before dropping to No. 44, or third worst in 2012, behind Tennessee and Texas, respectively, according to the report. Kathie Kane-Willis, co-founder and director of the ICDP, told Politifact Illinois the state’s budget woes are making the situation much worse, and Illinois already was in "pretty dire straits" long before the political tug-of-war between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled Legislature ensued. Illinois hasn’t had an actual budget for more than a year and the majority of the state’s social service providers that offer drug treatment programs haven’t been funded or received payment since July 1, 2015, leading many to cut programs, turn away people seeking help or shut down entirely. Although a six-month stopgap budget was passed on June 30 that appropriates $667 million for human services, including nonprofits and other social service providers, that only amounts to 65 percent of the cost of those services since last July. "When you look at Illinois, we have a crumbling treatment infrastructure," Kane-Willis said. "We do not have the capacity to treat the people who need it." Kane-Willis, a former heroin user, said that in light of these fiscal issues, Illinois probably now is second-worst in the U.S. when it comes to treatment capacity as Tennessee has improved and expanded treatment programs and capacity since the study was released. Treating those in need Durbin notes that as the state's treatment capacity shrinks, the vast majority of Illinoisans who are in need of treatment do not receive it. A report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, "Behavioral Health Barometer: Illinois, 2014," found "individuals aged 12 or older with illicit drug dependence or abuse, about 32,000 individuals (12.7 percent ) per year in 2009–2013 received treatment for their illicit drug use within the year prior to being surveyed." Our ruling Durbin said, "Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014 ... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity." The drug overdose figure Durbin uses came from provisional data provided to the senator by the CDC. In 2014, drug overdose deaths totaled 1,705, or 1,700 if using statistics from IDPH, which tend to be more accurate. As for the other figures, the percent increase from 2010 is slightly more than 32 percent, and drug overdose deaths in 2014 that were associated with heroin is about 42 percent. But as IDPH notes, tracking overdose deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined as counties’ coroners did not specifically test for heroin prior to 2013. We don’t see these discrepancies as an attempt to mislead in making his case for heroin and prescription opioid addiction treatment legislation he is advocating. If anything, it underscores the growing epidemic that’s not only gripping Illinois, but the rest of the country.

pomt-05851	"You can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/13/jack-lew/white-house-chief-staff-jack-lew-says-budget-requi/	With President Barack Obama a day away from offering his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, Jack Lew -- now the White House Chief of Staff and previously director of the Office of Management and Budget -- defended the Democratic-controlled Senate against Republican criticism about not planning to pass a budget. On the Feb. 12, 2012, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley, the host said to Lew, "I want to read for our viewers something (from) Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the U.S. Senate, who said, we do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year. It's done. We don't need to do it, talking about last year's two-year agreement and saying that, you know, … it's already done." Lew responded, "Well, let's be clear. What Sen. Reid is talking about is a fairly narrow point. In order for the Senate to do its annual work on appropriation bills, they need to pass a certain piece of legislation which sets a limit. They did that last year. That's what he's talking about. He's not saying that they shouldn't pass a budget. But we also need to be honest. You can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes, and you can't get 60 votes without bipartisan support. So unless Republicans are willing to work with Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reid is not going to be able to get a budget passed. And I think he was reflecting the reality that that could be a challenge." Critics of the Obama administration and a flurry of news outlets jumped on that comment as factually incorrect. So we decided to take a look for ourselves. The annual congressional budget resolution plays a very specific -- and for outsiders, arcane -- role in the process of spending the federal government’s money. It’s not a piece of legislation that actually spends money -- in fact, as a resolution, it doesn’t even have the force of law and does not go to the president to be signed -- but rather helps provide a general spending blueprint and helps define benchmarks in the budget process. "The budget resolution was designed to provide a framework to make budget decisions, leaving specific program determinations to the Appropriations Committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction," the Congressional Research Service writes. The process of writing a budget resolution begins following the submission of the president’s budget in January or February. We’ll skip a few interim steps (including floor consideration in the House) but when the budget resolution is ready to hit the floor in the Senate, its consideration is governed by section 305(b)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the law that enshrined the current federal budget process. Most business in the Senate is subject to filibustering -- that is, actions, or even just threats, to talk a bill to death. Filibusters can be overcome by what’s known as a "cloture" vote that shuts off debate and moves a measure toward final consideration. For the Senate to agree to cloture requires 60 votes -- a high threshold that many Senate majorities are unable to muster on controversial votes (and, increasingly, even on relatively uncontroversial votes). However, the filibuster cannot be used to block a budget resolution. That’s because the Budget Act sets out a specific amount of time for debate in the Senate -- 50 hours. If a specific amount of debate time is enshrined in the controlling statute, the filibuster is moot. So a simple majority -- not 60 votes -- is all that’s required to pass a budget resolution. Indeed, passing a budget resolution by at least 60 votes has become increasingly rare in recent years, according to CRS data. Since 1994, the Senate vote has exceeded that vote threshold just three times, either in the initial vote or on a subsequent vote in which lawmakers consider an identical House-Senate version of the resolution. More common in recent years are votes where 51 was enough to prevail. In 2009, the Senate even passed the final budget resolution by a 48-45 margin. "The budget resolution vote is always a partisan affair, and rarely does it gain any minority party support," said Steve Ellis, a vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense. So Lew is clearly wrong to say that "you can't pass a budget in the Senate of the United States without 60 votes." As a longtime senior official at OMB and other federal agencies, he should have known better. The White House, for its part, has said that Lew was referring to the general gridlock in Congress and not to the specific budget resolution. Some federal budget experts think the White House has a point, despite being wrong on the vote threshold for the budget resolution. A budget resolution is just a blueprint; being able to implement many of its provisions would likely require 60 votes eventually,said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues. "Lew is absolutely on the mark on the bigger picture," Meyers said. Still, Lew was precise in his wording, and on that claim, he was wrong. Our ruling On the specific question he was asked -- about the congressional budget resolution -- Lew said you need 60 votes to pass it. That’s flatly wrong. On the larger question of putting together what we think most people would call the "federal budget," a majority party may be able to get its budget resolution passed, but that’s not the same thing as actually enacting spending bills to implement it. In all likelihood, these bills would require 60 votes in the Senate. Still, Lew's specific claim was False.	None	Jack Lew	None	None	None	2012-02-13T13:52:36	2012-02-12	['United_States']
pomt-11033	"Clinton campaign official arrested by FBI on child rape/trafficking charges"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/02/blog-posting/websites-wrongly-claim-man-arrested-child-sex-char/	A new outrage is bubbling on social media, this time over the arrest of a 22-year-old man on charges of attempting to sexually exploit a child, enticing a child to engage in sexual activity and possessing child pornography. The charges have made news for several outlets — including the Washington Post — because the perpetrator was a well-known activist working to prevent sexual violence. Before his arrest, Joel Davis was the founding executive director of the international organization Youth to End Sexual Violence and a member of the International Campaign to Stop Rape & Gender Violence in Conflict, an international group of human rights experts. But some conservative websites have tried to attach another, unsubstantiated label to Davis, writing that he worked as a "campaign official" for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. We found no evidence to support this claim. "Clinton campaign official arrested by FBI on child rape/trafficking charges," said a June 27, 2018, headline from Puppet String News, an "alternative news" source, according to its about page. The Puppet String News report cited an article from blog site True Pundit, which in turn linked to a story from Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper. Several other blog sites with histories of peddling falsehoods online published similar articles. Both Puppet String News and True Pundit said Davis worked for Clinton’s election campaign. "Child trafficking is now exposed as officially embedded within the Clinton campaign, as Clinton for 2016 campaign staffer Joel Davis has been arrested for raping children and trying to meet up with children as young as two," the Puppet String news story said. "The Clinton campaign literally just had a top staffer arrested on child rape/trafficking charges by the FBI … you can only bet it goes all the way to Hillary Clinton and obvious top aides." The Daily Mail story — the likely source for both inaccurate reports — made no such claim, but did include a photo from Davis’ Facebook page that showed the university student wearing a Clinton campaign pin and standing in front of multiple Clinton campaign posters. The three others in the photo can be seen holding clipboards and folders, but Davis’s hands are empty, save for a cup of coffee. A caption attributed to the photo by the Daily Mail said, "He's with her: Davis posted this picture after Hillary Clinton's election defeat, suggesting he had campaigned for the 2016 loser." Davis was allegedly committing the same crimes he was outwardly fighting, according to a Justice Department press release. Davis texted undercover FBI agents sexually explicit photos and videos of children and said he wanted to have sex with children of any age, according to the federal criminal complaint. And, Davis was a Clinton supporter to some degree. In what he called "the only post about #election2016 I'm going to write," Davis wrote in a Nov. 9, 2016, Facebook post that "felt betrayed" by the election result because he had been living "inside a liberal bubble." But Davis never indicated that he had worked for Clinton, and even if he had, campaigning for Clinton is not the same as being a "campaign official" or a "top staffer." We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any credible reports connecting Davis to Clinton. We also checked Davis’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and found no mention of the campaign. Seemingly, the only evidence to support the claim that Davis worked for the Clinton campaign is a photo showing him and three others with Clinton campaign pins and posters. (Puppet String News did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger.) That does not make him a top Clinton aide, staffer or official. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05973	"We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,"	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/24/robert-hagan/bob-hagan-says-youngstown-never-had-earthquake-unt/	When a 4.0 earthquake likely caused by fracking waste injected into a fault line occurred in Youngstown on New Year's Eve, one of the residents whose home was shaken by the quake was state Rep. Robert Hagan. The veteran Democratic lawmaker from Youngstown has a well-earned reputation for being outspoken so it's no surprise that Hagan has taken the lead in calling for a moratorium on injecting waste deep into the ground and asking pointed questions about the incident.. At a Jan. 10 statehouse protest to support the moratorium on waste disposal wells, Hagan told the crowd that the earthquake had raised a number of questions including why Gov. John Kasich's administration did not react more quickly to 10 smaller earthquakes which had struck the Youngstown area in the 10 months preceding the New Year’s Eve shake-up. The Democratic lawmaker even seemed to lay the blame for the quake at the feet of Kasich. "We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor," Hagan said. Hagan's claim shook up the sensors at the Politifact Ohio monitoring center. Was Youngstown really earthquake-free until John Kasich became the state's chief executive on Jan. 10, 2011? We contacted Hagan who said he consulted a map of earthquakes in Ohio produced by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources before he made his comment. "Sure, there's been some minor seismic activity, but earthquakes -- which is a 2.0 (on the Richter Scale) or better -- haven't happened until the past year," Hagan said. "That's what ODNR's own map shows." We checked with ODNR and the state's seismic monitoring system -- which has only been in place since about 1999 hasn't detected any earthquakes in the Youngstown area prior to March 2011. "We have not recorded a significantly felt seismic event in Youngstown since the networks were put in place about 1999," said Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokesman Carlo LoParo. Prior to the monitoring equipment being in place, ODNR’s record of historical earthquakes in Ohio relies on other monitoring systems such as those done by the U.S. Geological Survey and accounts from newspaper reports. And those don't show any earthquakes in Youngstown. However, LoParo said there have been other earthquakes nearby that were felt in Youngstown. "There have been some significant earthquakes in Ashtabula, Summit County and Mercer County, Pennsylvania that were felt across northeast Ohio and in Youngstown," LoParo said. Youngstown State professor Jeffrey Dick, the chair of the school’s Geological and Environmental Sciences Department, also confirmed that Youngstown itself has been a quiet zone seismically before the recent series of earthquakes thought to be linked to the injection well. "Earthquakes in this part of Ohio are pretty uncommon," he said. "The reason is that underneath the ground in this part of the state is what's known as the Grenville Province -- it's a body of rock that is sometimes known as the Precambrian basement rock of Ohio. And it doesn't have major structural features that would cause earthquakes." Dick said he wasn't aware of any earthquakes centered in Youngstown prior to the recent series linked to the injection well. He said most earthquakes in Ohio run along major fault lines, such as one running under eastern Lake Erie waters or another in western Ohio centered around Shelby County, not far from the Indiana border. Indeed, it looks like Hagan is right that earthquakes haven't come to Youngstown before March 2011 when Kasich was governor. But regardless of the timing of the quakes, Hagan makes a rhetorical stretch to imply that the earthquake happened because Kasich was governor. The injection wells are not something that Kasich is the first governor to allow -- they have been around for several decades. And Kasich did not weaken regulations on drilling regulations or do anything that could be construed as making it more likely the earthquake would happen. In fact, state regulators have said the company that owns the Youngstown well -- D&L Energy -- was not violating its permit by injecting too much waste or injecting it too quickly into the ground. So let’s drill down to the core here: Hagan spoke at a rally to support a moratorium banning the deep well injection of fracking waste after an 4.0 earthquake linked to the practice struck Youngstown on New Year's Eve. At the rally, Hagan linked the earthquakes to the Kasich administration saying, "We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was governor." ODNR officials as well as an expert on the Mahoning Valley's geology confirm that earthquakes have never occurred in Youngstown prior to a series that began in March 2011. But even though Hagan is right about the quakes only began when Kasich was governor, its hyperbole to suggest that Kasich is somehow directly responsible for the earthquakes. Earthquakes linked to injection wells are relatively rare occurrences, so it seems that the Kasich administration is probably more unlucky than anything to be in charge when it happened. We’ll give Hagan a point for his geologic accuracy, but he can’t shake the fact that Kasich isn’t the cause of the quakes. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-06977	Florida’s proposed Health Care Freedom Act "will allow Floridians to opt out of Obama’s govt. takeover of healthcare!"	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/13/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-says-florida-law-could-allow-stat/	One of Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos’ first acts in the 2011 legislative session was to sponsor and shepherd through a proposed constitutional amendment targeting the federal health care law. Sponsorship of the resolution is useful for Haridopolos -- a Republican from Merritt Island who is running for the U.S. Senate -- when talk turns to what Republicans derisively call "ObamaCare." He touted that work recently on Twitter, tweeting on June 29: "Proud to support this amendment that will allow Floridians to opt out of Obama’s govt. takeover of healthcare!" Whether or not the federal health care legislation is a "govt. takeover of healthcare!" is the subject of a previous fact-check that earned a Pants on Fire ruling and was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year in 2010. But we did wonder: If 60 percent of Florida voters support Haridopolos’ amendment when it appears on the ballot in November 2012 and the Health Care Freedom Act becomes part of Florida’s Constitution, what effect will it have on implementation of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the state? Would it really "allow Floridians to opt out" of it? To answer the question, we went to the American Legislative Exchange Council, which publishes "A Legislators Guide to Repealing ObamaCare." ALEC also crafted the model legislation that is the foundation of Haridopolos’ amendment. At least 42 states have passed or are considering similar laws, according to ALEC. But the organization says that the state laws and constitutional amendments have no immediate impact on implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. They only pave the way for a court battle, should the law ultimately be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. "Does it allow Floridians to opt out if it’s successful? Yes," said Christie Herrara, director of ALEC’s health task force. "A lawsuit would have to be filed." The "opt out," in that case, would come as the result of a legal challenge by states that would argue their constitutions prohibit the implementation of the federal health care law. But it’s a long shot any federal court would side with the states’ argument. "There is a whole body of case law that is very consistent," said Barry Richard, a Tallahassee-based constitutional law attorney who represented George W. Bush in the 2000 vote recount. "This is not a close call." Lawyers and legal scholars say the states’ challenge would be tossed aside because of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, and a paragraph known as the supremacy clause. Specifically, the clause states that the U.S. Constitution, and federal treaties and laws are the "supreme Law of the Land." It requires state judges to follow federal law in any conflict with state laws or constitutions. In this situation, the federal law requires that people have health insurance, a provision commonly called the "individual mandate." Haridopolos’ amendment to the Florida Constitution would prohibit laws that compel people to have health care coverage. "This is precisely what the supremacy clause was meant to deal with, when you have the federal government saying one thing and the state saying something else," said Mike Allen, a constitutional law professor at Stetson University in Gulfport. It would be impossible to comply with both laws at once, he said. And in such instances, he said, the federal law almost always wins. That’s necessary, says Steve Valdeck, a law professor at American University, to preserve the structure of the U.S. government. "I think we have settled the question that the Constitution makes the federal government supreme over the states. If one state could decide on its own they want to withdraw from a federal law, there’s nothing to stop other states from doing it," Valdeck said. "Pretty soon you’ve destroyed the central premise on which our country is founded, which is a central federal government." Now there is one scenario in which Haridopolos’ amendment could protect Floridians from an individual mandate. If the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately rules in favor of the 26 states suing to stop implementation of the individual mandate, Florida’s constitutional amendment would be moot as far as federal health care reform is concerned. But, the state constitutional amendment would prohibit future state Legislatures from enacting an individual mandate if they ever decide to put forward their own health care plan, as Massachusetts did. But Haridopolos didn’t mention protecting Floridians from a state law. He referred specifically to Obama and the federal law. Bottom line: All the state constitutional amendment guarantees is standing for a lawsuit against the federal government. Floridians could only "opt out" of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against the supremacy of the federal law. That’s a major, gigantic if. There’s at least a remote enough chance that the court would rule in favor of Florida in a lawsuit, so Haridopolos’ statement doesn’t warrant a Pants On Fire ruling. However, it’s clearly False.

pomt-05105	Says there are "$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed [health care law]."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/29/jon-runyan/jon-runyan-claims-barack-obamas-health-care-includ/	A discredited claim is making a comeback following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding most of the national health care reform law. U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said in a press release on Thursday that the law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, makes cuts to Medicare. "My constituents simply cannot afford the $500 billion in new tax increases and $500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation, nor can our economy sustain the job-killing mandates and regulations it imposes," Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, said in a press release. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, repeated the claim in his statement about the high court’s ruling, saying "Obamacare cuts Medicare - cuts Medicare by approximately $500 billion dollars." Both claims distort the truth, as our PolitiFact colleagues have found many times. The law aims to slow future growth in Medicare spending. It does not cut from the Medicare program. The health care law made several changes to Medicare, which provides health insurance for millions of seniors and people under 65 receiving Social Security disability payments. Some of the changes will increase Medicare spending to help cover prevention services and to fill the so-called doughnut hole, a gap in prescription drug coverage for some enrollees, according to a tutorial by Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project for the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that analyzes the health care system. Other changes aim to reduce growth in Medicare spending, by more than $500 billion over 10 years, though estimates of the future savings vary. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have both released reports since the health care law passed showing that the Affordable Care Act will reduce future spending growth on Medicare by more than $500 billion. The Affordable Care Act "contains numerous provisions that, on balance, will reduce federal spending on Medicare," the CBO said in a June 2012 report. The biggest portion of that savings, according to Neuman’s tutorial, will come from reducing annual increases in payments to medical providers. But the health care law does not cut $500 billion from Medicare. It just reduces future growth. With the law, Medicare spending will still increase. It’s important to note, as PolitiFact has found, that the savings from the reduction in Medicare spending will help offset spending on other provisions of the health care law, a point that Runyan noted in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey. "The CBO projects Medicare savings of approximately $500 Billion and instead of using that money to shore up the program, the savings are diverted from Medicare and used to fund other provisions of ObamaCare. Even worse, this piece of legislation is hitting individuals, working families and small businesses with a massive tax increase that will further cripple the economy and slow job creation," Runyan said. Our ruling Runyan, repeating a Republican talking point about Obama’s health care law, said there are "$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation." The legislation aims to slow projected spending on Medicare by more than $500 billion over a 10-year period, but it does not cut that money from the program. Medicare spending will increase over that time frame. Still, a sliver of truth exists in this claim, because the difference in the spending will help offset costs of other provisions in the law. We rate this claim Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Jon Runyan	None	None	None	2012-06-29T07:30:00	2012-06-28	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-00174	Says John Culberson got $680 million for a telescope in South America and voted against fixing dams and FEMA funding to prevent flooding.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/22/lizzie-pannill-fletcher/lizzie-fletcher-ad-misleads-attack-culberson-and-t/	Telescopes and natural disasters. That’s what is packed into one of the latest ads from Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, the Democratic hopeful looking to unseat U.S. Rep. John Culberson, the 18-year Republican incumbent in Texas’ 7th Congressional District. The district covers a portion of western Houston and backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by a margin of 1.4 points. Fletcher's ad "My House," released Oct. 12, hits Culberson with claims that he got "$680 million for a telescope in South America" while also "voting against funding to fix dams in Texas and against FEMA funding to prepare for floods." The ad shows residents holding up photos of their homes flooded out by storms that hit the area — Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, the Memorial Day Flood in 2015, and Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In our analysis, we found that Culberson was involved in the funding of an expensive telescope and did vote against bills that had components of fixing dams and funding for FEMA. However, the telescope money is a bit misconstrued, and his votes on dams and FEMA would have had little to no impact on Houston’s recovery. The telescope The telescope in question is called the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). According to Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, the LSST will be the ultimate survey telescope, mapping the sky every three days and logging anything that moves, changes or disappears. Construction began in 2014 and the National Science Foundation expects it to be completed by 2023. It’s a U.S.-backed project, but according to the NSF, Chile was selected for the telescope’s location because of "optimal sky transparency and image quality." The NSF expects to spend a total of $473 million on the telescope, given in increments by the appropriations committee over the project’s 9-year timeline. The U.S. Energy Department is putting up $168 million. There was also some private funding put toward the project raised by the LSST Corporation. The $680 million the ad talks about is the total cost of the telescope that was already approved by the U.S. House appropriations subpanel on commerce, justice and science, which Culberson chairs. The Fletcher campaign refers to a May 2018 Science Magazine article that discusses Culberson accelerating the telescope’s funding. To stay on pace with the timeline, NSF assumed that Congress would provide almost $49 million in 2019. Instead, Culberson decided to put $123 million into the 2019 bill – a $74 million jump. LSST directors, along with NSF officials, were baffled by the increase, according to the article, but Culberson said it was a move to get things up and running quickly. Whether speeding up the project was necessary or not, it doesn’t have much to do with flooding in Houston. That’s because the money funding the telescope cannot be moved or allocated to another budget, as the ad implies. There are 12 appropriations bills, and each bill is allotted a certain amount of money for one fiscal year. The NSF is funded in the CJS bill (commerce, justice, science). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which funds many flood-control infrastructure projects, is part of the Energy and Water bill. Congress is not permitted to move money between bills. The vote on fixing dams The ad highlights Culberson’s vote against H.R. 3324, known as the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2007. The bill, which ultimately passed the house, would authorize $201 million over five years for a FEMA grant program to fix publicly-owned deficient dams. The root of contention in the district are the 1940s-era Addicks and Barker dams, Houston’s primary defense against flooding and both aging structures that were deemed to be "high risk" as early as 2004. The dams were in the middle of repairs (from a 2015, $72 million effort to construct new outlet gates) when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, and forced officials to release water that flooded neighborhoods. But the 2007 bill that Culberson voted against would not have impacted either dam, as the program would have only rehabilitated non-federally owned dams. The Addicks and Barker dams are owned by the federal government and would not have benefited from the program. The vote related to FEMA and flood prevention According to Congressional Quarterly, which tracks how members of Congress vote, Culberson voted against a Patrick Murphy, D-Fla., motion in June 2013 that would have recommitted bill HR 2217, (the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2014), to the Appropriations Committee and "report it back immediately with an amendment that would increase by $25 million the total provided for FEMA activities including state and local programs, training, exercises and technical assistance." The funding would also be used for a pre-disaster mitigation grant program. The motion was rejected by a vote of 196-226. The Culberson campaign says this was a procedural vote on a bill that would have added money to first responder training, not funding to aid homeowners or make infrastructure more resilient. Culberson voted for the final version of the bill, which passed 245-182. In the final version, the bill directs FEMA to manage the funds made available to address any major disaster declared on or after Aug. 27, 2011, and to establish a pilot program for the relocation of state facilities. The bill included almost $158 million for training first responders on state and local levels and $6.2 billion for the FEMA disaster relief fund. In one of the bill’s approved amendments, funding for FEMA’s National Predisaster Mitigation Fund was increased by $7.65 million. Our ruling Fletcher’s ad, which shows victims of recent flooding, says that Culberson got $680 million for a telescope in South America but voted against measures to fix dams and help prevent flooding. That claim is misleading. Culberson chairs a committee that allocated money for space projects and more than doubled the amount that the telescope group requested for 2019. However, it was already within the $680 million total cost of the project, and the money could not be transferred to flood relief. Culberson did vote against two measures — one in 2007 and one in 2013 — that had to do with fixing dams and FEMA funding. But the earlier bill provided money to fix publicly-owned dams, excluding the federally-owned Addicks and Barker structures, the two dams that impacted Houston during Harvey and the Memorial Day flood. The 2013 motion would have added on an amendment to increase $25 million for FEMA programs. He voted against that motion, but voted for the final version of the bill, which included an additional $7.65 million to FEMA, besides money already in place for training first responders and the disaster relief fund. The ad gets some things right, but doesn’t provide context for the measures he voted against as well as the full story behind the telescope. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03792	Says Texas has "11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/27/scott-henson/scott-henson-says-texas-has-11-different-felonies-/	Scott Henson of Austin, who writes the Grits for Breakfast blog on criminal justice policy and politics, told the Austin Post, an online community newspaper, that Texas and the nation have "criminalized far too much of public life." "I think we have somewhere in the range of 2,500 or so felonies on the books in Texas," Henson said in an interview posted online Feb. 25, 2013. "There are 11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster." That cracked our interest, partly because the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation likewise said about a month earlier that Texas has 11 felonies (not a dozen, dang it) related to harvesting oysters. Felonies are considered the most serious criminal offenses. By email, the center’s Marc Levin, director of its Center for Effective Justice, pointed out a January 2012 publication, the "Current Offense Severity Rankings List," written by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. Henson told us by email that Levin was his source for the count when he initially wrote about the topic in 2007. He also said he would check his claim against the state’s "offense severity" list. Among the state-listed 2,324 felonies, Levin said, some are rather similar or are enhancements of lesser offenses, though the agency "presumably uses a consistent methodology to delineate each separate offense." He said the tally of oyster-related felonies aired by the foundation "allows for some that the parole board counts as separate offenses which some might consider to be essentially the same offense." We spotted 16 oyster-connected felonies on the list but pruned three that appeared to be duplicates. Also, as Levin noted, two felonies appeared distinct from others only because they take into consideration repeat offenses. Theft of oysters from a private bed is a felony, as is theft of oysters from a private bed and having two or more previous convictions. Similarly, harvesting oysters in a restricted area is a felony, as is oystering in a restricted area with a previous conviction. Adjusting for the seeming duplications and near-similar felonies knocked the oyster-tied felonies in state law to 11: theft of oysters placed on a private seabed; interfering with an oyster buoy or marker with two previous convictions; oystering in a restricted area as designated by the state; night dredging of oysters; night dredging in a restricted area with a previous conviction; night dredging in a polluted area; not having an oystering license; harvesting oysters for non-commercial purposes without a license; harvesting oysters without a commercial license; selling sport oysters; and violating oyster regulations. By telephone and email, a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department official confirmed the felonies, though Brandi Reeder, the agency’s fisheries law administrator, stressed that a person could be charged with each felony only if they have been convicted of similar misdemeanor violations in the previous five years--sometimes just once, in other cases two or more times, according to the relevant statutes. At our request, Reeder reviewed our identified 11 felonies, later saying by email that she would say there are seven distinct oyster-related offenses or crimes. Broadly, Reeder said, the oyster felonies are in place for a reason, to deter nefarious, potentially risky activities. "An oyster can kill you," Reeder said, referring to the possible presence of viruses, bacteria and parasites in raw shellfish. "That’s why we take it seriously." But Texans rarely face oyster felony charges, Reeder said, because nearly all offenders stop after being charged with a misdemeanor. Statewide in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012, according to the agency, no such felonies were charged. By telephone, neither Henson nor Levin expressed surprise that no oyster felonies were charged in a recent year or that no one can be charged with such a felony without a prior misdemeanor conviction. With a laugh, Henson said: "I guess the laws worked. They stamped out oyster crime in Texas." Henson and Levin each said, too, the oyster felonies demonstrate regulatory issues--such as having a license or fishing in restricted waters--being placed inappropriately into criminal statutes. Levin said there is an opportunity to shrink the number of state crimes starting from a Texas House proposal to create a commission that would recommend changes in advance of the 2015 legislative session. Our ruling Henson said there are 11 Texas felonies one can commit with an oyster. He could have said 16, according to the state’s breakdown of felony offenses, though Parks & Wildlife suggests such oyster-related crimes break down to seven distinct offenses. Significantly, too, these felony charges are rare. No one can even face one without having previously been convicted of at least one related misdemeanor. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-00890	"The labor participation rate is at an all-time low."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-has-it-wrong-meet-press-labor-parti/	A shrinking unemployment rate isn’t enough for Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to say the economy is bouncing back from the recession. On NBC’s Meet the Press March 8, host Chuck Todd noted that unemployment is at its lowest since May 2008. And in 2014, unemployment went down in every state — a first since 1984. Todd asked Graham if Republicans — who have criticized President Barack Obama’s economic policies — could admit that some progress has been made. "I think that we do have stagnant middle-class wage growth, and I think the labor participation rate is at an all-time low," Graham said. "So if your argument is that we’re on the road to recovery, we had a sound economy under President Obama, no I don’t agree with that at all." Pointing out that the labor participation rate has been on the decline is a typical retort among Republicans in response to arguments that the unemployment rate is shrinking. While low unemployment rate is generally a good thing, economists also say you want a high labor participation rate. That’s because the higher the rate, the more members of the working-age population that are actively seeking employment. But is today’s labor participation rate at an "all-time low"? Not so. As of February, the labor participation rate is 62.8 percent, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rates were consistently lower than what they are today from 1948 through 1978 — with the lowest point at 58.1 percent in December 1954. (Available data goes back to 1948.) Below is a graph showing the trend since 1950: In fairness to Graham, today’s labor participation rate is essentially the lowest it’s been since 1978. The rate increased steadily from the mid 1960s through the late 1990s, when it hit a peak of 67 percent. Since Obama has been in office, the rate has dropped 2.9 percentage points. Much of the increase in the labor participation rate in the second half of the 20th century largely has to do with a massive increase in the number of women seeking employment as a result of changes such as better access to contraceptives and anti-gender discrimination legislation, according to an economic report out of the White House, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. This major social difference in the country’s workforce makes it difficult to compare labor participation rates today to those 50 years ago. Another important reason for labor participation rate increase through the 1990s was the fact that baby boomers reached their "peak working years," according to the report. Factors contributing to current decline are up for debate. On the one hand, there’s concern that people are discouraged about their job prospects. The slow recovery from the recent recession may have prompted people to go back to school, stay at home with their kids or give up on a job search altogether. But absent the recession, labor participation would have dropped anyway, Brookings economist Gary Burtless told PolitiFact in 2013. Why? Because the baby boomers have started to retire. And as the population gets older, fewer people will be working overall, meaning the labor participation rate will continue to decline in the coming decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally the rate of female labor participation — which increased rapidly through the 1990s — has since plateaued and declined slightly. (The labor participation rate among men has decreased more.) The White House report found that half the decline in labor participation is a result of the aging population, while the other half is a combination of cyclical economic trends, the recession and existing trends such as the decline of female workers. The report also notes that while labor force participation among young adults has declined about 0.8 percentage points a year since 2007, school and college enrollment has increased. So the rate of young adults either working or in school has remained relatively unchanged. Our ruling Graham said, "The labor participation rate is at an all-time low." Graham’s office did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment. The rate was lower than it is today from 1948 to 1978. That said, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison and the labor participation is at about its lowest level in 37 years. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09192	Says the Arizona immigration law "expressly bans racial profiling."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/may/28/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-arizona-immigration-law-bans-racial-pr/	Simmering over the immigration bill Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law in April, Mexico President Felipe Calderon told a joint session of Congress May 20 that the tough law invites racial profiling. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has urged the federal government to increase border security, including sending unmanned aircrafts to survey the Texas-Mexico border, quickly took Calderon to task for lecturing Americans on their state laws. "I wish that the president of the United States, the president of Mexico, the attorney general, and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security would have done what anybody can do with Internet access, which is to download a copy of the Arizona bill and read it for themselves," Cornyn said on NBC's Meet the Press May 23. "It expressly bans racial profiling." Does it? Generally, the law makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. Right away, though, whether the law encouraged police officers to choose who to stop based on race proved a provocative question. The law's phrasing — saying officers "may not solely consider race" — prompted critics to condemn the law for effectively permitting officers to single out racial or ethnic characteristics to justify interrogations. On April 30, Brewer reacted by signing into law the removal of "solely" from the provision, which now says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." In a news release, Brewer said that with the change, it's "crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated in Arizona." Not necessarily, legal experts say, pointing out that what's permitted under the U.S. and Arizona constitutions — specifically, the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal document — has fed conflicting court rulings. The Fourth Amendment, which prohibits "unreasonable searches and seizures" was tested in a case in the 1970's concerning conditions the U.S. Border Patrol had to meet to ask motorists about their citizenship. A roving patrol unit had stopped a vehicle in California near the Mexican border and questioned its occupants about their immigration status. In 1975, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the questioning didn't violate the amendment. The court said that while "the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry ... because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer ... may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances." Any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause, the court said. In the opinion, Justice Lewis Powell wrote: "The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor," even though "standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens." In other words, racial factors can be used in profiling, the court held, just as long as they are not the only factors — language reflected in the Arizona law's original wording. However, Daniel Capra, a professor of law at Fordham University, pointed to a later case (United States v. Whren in 1996). Here, plainclothes policeman patrolling a "high-drug area" in Washington observed two black men driving a truck turn suddenly without signaling and speed off. The officers stopped the truck and saw plastic bags of cocaine. Facing federal drug charges, the men sought to suppress the evidence, arguing the stop wasn't justified by either reasonable suspicion or probable cause they were engaged in illegal drug activity. The Supreme Court found that because the men violated traffic laws, the stop didn't violate the Fourth Amendment, and also spoke to their claim that allowing police officers to investigate other legal violations after a routine traffic stop could lead to stopping cars based only on a driver's race. The court noted that the "Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race," citing the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants "equal protection of the laws." In 1997, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that under the Fourteenth Amendment, "citizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws at all times. If law enforcement adopts a policy, employs a practice, or in a given situation takes steps to initiate an investigation of a citizen based solely upon that citizen's race, without more, then a violation of the Equal Protection clause has occurred." Here, the defendant had argued that airport officers in Cincinnati seized his carry-on bag — which contained cocaine — solely because of his race. And in 2000, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — a federal court whose jurisdiction includes Arizona — ruled that stopping someone because of that person's Hispanic appearance is impermissible because "the majority of people who pass through the checkpoint in question (in El Centro, Calif.) are Hispanic." The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that its conclusion contradicted some language in the Brignoni-Ponce case. Yet, it said, in "suggesting that ethnic appearance could be relevant, the (Supreme) Court relied heavily on now-outdated demographic information." By 2000, the court said, there were so many more legal U.S. residents of Mexican ancestry, it was no longer reasonable to stop someone because they look Hispanic. Brewer said the latest changes to Arizona's immigration law "lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling." Checking her statement, PolitiFact.com spoke with legal experts who said that, at a minimum, conflicts among the various court decisions needs to be resolved. Besides, while the revised Arizona law bans unconstitutional racial profiling, it still permits profiling based on cues such as clothing or behavior. Experts told PolitiFact the law draws a hazy, perhaps unenforceable line between permitted profiling and illegal approaches. Another concern: Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in racial profiling, intentionally or unwittingly. "If Arizona state and local police considered 'Mexican appearance' as permitted by Brignoni-Ponce, some would say that is racial profiling," Johnson told us. PolitiFact concluded that the revised law has too much wiggle room to back up Brewer's statement that it lays "to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling." Of course, Cornyn didn't venture as far as Brewer. He simply said the law expressly bans such profiling, and it does — though the law also expressly leaves room for profiling that passes constitutional muster, a significant and legally squishy factor that Cornyn's statement doesn't acknowledge. Experts expect the profiling topic to be thrashed out for years to come. We rate Cornyn's statement as Half True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-05-28T22:31:22	2010-05-23	['Arizona']
pomt-07565	Says the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act adopted last year contains "a series of slush funds, set up to stay on the books automatically, with little or no oversight."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/31/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-labels-money-health-car/	Republicans and Democrats alike marked the recent anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s passage. The White House issued a report listing benefits the bill had brought to Ohioans, like free wellness visits, mammograms and colonoscopies for Medicare beneficiaries, while Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner issued statements that said it destroys jobs and should be repealed. "In the coming weeks, you’ll see more votes and more hearings in the House to take this law apart, step by step," Boehner promised in a press release and video disseminated to reporters on March 23 . "That includes repealing the law’s mandatory spending slush funds." Boehner expounded more on the health care "slush fund" theme in a video released the previous week. "Let’s look at Obamacare," Boehner said in the March 14 video. "Its authors went to great lengths to protect their government takeover of health care from anyone attempting to repeal it. They funneled federal bureaucrats billions of taxpayer dollars to implement this job-crushing health care law. This isn't just some startup money that fell into the wrong hands. It's a series of slush funds, set up to stay on the books automatically, with little or no oversight." Asked for the rationale behind Boehner’s "slush fund" claims, his office provided a memorandum from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. It described the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as "unusual in the sense that it provided mandatory spending for numerous newly created or established programs that would normally be considered discretionary in nature." By way of explanation, it noted that "discretionary" government spending is allotted by Congress each year, while "mandatory" spending occurs outside the congressional appropriations process. The document prepared for a March 9 subcommittee hearing cited as examples a program that allows the Health and Human Services Secretary to provide grants for states to set up health insurance exchanges, a separate $17.75 billion account the HHS Secretary could use for prevention and public health programs for nine years, and a third section of the bill that authorizes the Secretary to award $200 million in grants over three years to construct school-based health centers. Also targeted is a "personal responsibility education program" that would be funded with $75 million each year from 2010 through 2014, and $230 million in development grants for teaching health centers that would be issued between 2011 and 2015. The Energy and Commerce Committee is drafting legislation to eliminate those programs. "This should concern every Member that we have a created a slush fund that the Secretary can spend from without any Congressional oversight or approval," health subcommittee chairman Joe Pitts, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in his opening statement at the hearing. Democrats at the hearing said that when Republicans controlled Congress, they also put mandatory spending into bills that created new programs, such as 2003 legislation that created the Medicare prescription drug program. HHS spokesman Keith Maley noted that bipartisan legislation that Congress passed to create the Childrens’ Health Insurance Program did the same thing. "Congress maintains its full oversight authority as it does in other instances in which it chooses to include a mandatory appropriation in a piece of legislation," Maley said in an email. "Additionally, HHS maintains appropriate program integrity controls on the use of the funds." The health care bill provides several pools of money that the HHS Secretary can disburse for purposes designated by the legislation. Is it appropriate to call them "slush funds?" The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a "slush fund" as "an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes." The money vexing Republicans is designated for programs specifically defined by the law, which hardly makes them illicit and unregulated. Congress also has the power to oversee the bill’s implementation, and Republicans have held several hearings on the subject already this year.

pomt-08278	About 1 in 10 public school teachers in Wisconsin would have been laid off without federal stimulus funds.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/08/jim-doyle/wisconsin-gov-jim-doyle-says-10-percent-public-sch/	Lame-duck governor Jim Doyle’s low popularity rating among Wisconsin voters guaranteed he would keep a low profile while Tom Barrett fought -- unsuccessfully -- to keep a Democrat in charge in Madison. But that doesn’t mean Doyle was silent. In mid-October, Doyle was showcased on a BBC NewsHour radio feature that asked whether the United States needed a second shot of stimulus money from Washington. Not surprisingly, Doyle defended President Barack Obama and blamed Republicans for creating an enormous fiscal mess that demanded an unpopular but necessary response -- the giant stimulus bill OK’d in early in 2009. Doyle said stimulus grants helped keep schools functioning well, boosted road projects and showered funds on University of Wisconsin medical researchers. And he talked of how he has tried to sell the public on the measure’s positive impact: Said Doyle: "I say to people, ‘You want to see stimulus money at work you should go to the (local) public school … about every 10th teacher wouldn’t be teaching there if we hadn’t had the help that came from President Obama.’ " With all the controversy over jobs saved and created, did the stimulus money really save 1 in 10 teacher jobs in Wisconsin? We’ll put our pencil to this test. In making the claim, Doyle points to a federal report that says there were 9,922 education jobs funded by federal stimulus cash. That represents about 1 in 10 of the 105,000 public school employees in the most recent state figures. Of course, that refers to all employees, not just teachers -- the first wrinkle in a calculation that is a lot trickier than 2 + 2 = 4. Other considerations: The reporting to the federal government on jobs created and saved by stimulus money doesn’t break down the type of position. Some of the reporting requirements have changed and aren’t very useful for drawing judgments about the real world impact. Let’s start with the overall numbers. Near the end of the 2009-’10 school year, the state reported 9,922 jobs were being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (commonly known as the stimulus package). Doyle acknowledges that those numbers include support staff and others -- not strictly teachers. His policy director, Christopher Patton, says it’s reasonable to conclude that ratio for teachers in the group of jobs saved is the same as that for all employees. But there is no way to know for sure -- the feds didn’t require that level of detail from school districts. There’s another hitch: The biggest chunk by far of the education funding in the stimulus was sent to local districts in two different school years -- 2008-’09 and 2009-’10, according to the state Department of Public Instruction and various local school officials. That dough came in two uneven chunks a year apart, and totaled a whopping $717 million. Thus, some was spent to preserve jobs in the first year and some in the second year. Some districts applied it to teachers salaries, some put it toward other workers -- including bus drivers at Milwaukee Public Schools in 2009-’10. Some of the money didn’t go to salaries at all. It went to pay the bills. So, if you visit a school -- as Doyle’s scenario suggests -- not all of those jobs were saved in the current year. In fact, some may have essentially been saved from layoff twice. There is no way to say how many. The federal reporting requirements, which Doyle is citing, lumped them all into one year. Even if you accept Doyle’s premise that nearly 10 percent of teachers were funded by stimulus, it’s far from certain they would have been laid off without it. Some districts might have been forced to contemplate layoffs, but more likely they would have dipped into reserve funds or found other ways to save some or all of the jobs. That’s according to two people on the front lines: Emily Koczela and Mark Boehlke, business managers for Brown Deer and Shorewood schools, respectively. Part of the reason: timing. Both stimulus payments were received toward the end of school years, when layoffs were virtually unthinkable. And, according to Koczela and Boehlke, it was likely too late at that point to break teachers’ contracts for the following school year. There are other, smaller stimulus-related pots of funding for education that more clearly saved jobs than did the $717 million. For instance, Koczela said some special education teachers likely faced layoff without those allocations. So, Doyle’s statement is based on actual numbers, but makes an assumption that cannot be proven and faces some practical realities that suggest it is off base. Patton, Doyle’s policy director, said the fact remains that 9,922 jobs were funded through the federal help. And he argued that the sheer size of the federal aid to state schools makes it common sense that teachers would have been in harm’s way. "When you look at $800 million in aid to schools, it’s pretty hard to imagine those types of reductions that would not result in larger class sizes and less teachers in schools," he said. But we’re left with the numbers, and how Doyle used them in the BBC interview. To illustrate his point about the benefit of stimulus funding, Doyle argues that 1 in 10 public school teachers -- out of some 60,000 in the state -- would be out of work without the stimulus money. But his math is based on an assumption that teachers would have been targeted at the same proportion as support staff and ignores the practical realities of how the money came in during two budget years, which means some of the jobs may have been saved twice. We rate Doyle’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06562	"[Federal] law says that you can't give in-state tuition to an illegal alien … unless you first offer it to any other student regardless of their state of residence."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/02/terry-gorman/head-rhode-islanders-immigration-law-enforcement-s/	The Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education’s unanimous vote Monday night to extend in-state tuition rates to undocumented students is drawing fire from the leader of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, who says it violates federal law. RIILE’s executive director, William T. "Terry" Gorman, made the claim Sept. 21 in an interview on Channel 10, and repeated it to the Board of Governors and some 400 people who crowded into the gymnasium at the Community College of Rhode Island before the board’s vote. Granting in-state tuition rates to undocumented students violates federal law, Gorman said on Channel 10, "because the law says that you can't give in-state tuition to an illegal alien . . . unless you first offer it to any other student regardless of their state of residence." If Gorman is right, a high school graduate from New Jersey would have to be granted in-state tuition in Rhode Island before the public colleges could offer the same tuition break to a Rhode Island high school graduate who is undocumented. We decided to check it out. First, some background. The Rhode Island policy Out-of-state students who enroll at one of Rhode Island's three public colleges -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College or the Community College of Rhode Island -- pay more than double the in-state rates. At URI, for example, Rhode Island students pay just under $11,400 in tuition and fees, compared with about $27,400 for out-of-state residents. A study conducted by the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University showed that 74 undocumented students were attending one of the three public institutions of higher education in Rhode Island in 2009. The study predicts that number will grow by 24 with the in-state tuition policy. Federal law prohibits undocumented students from receiving federal funds for college, such as Guaranteed Student Loans and Pell Grants. To qualify for those funds, students must be either U.S. citizens or immigrants granted permanent residency. The policy the board approved Monday allows undocumented students who have attended a Rhode Island high school for at least three years, and continue to live in the state, to be eligible to pay the in-state rate. The students are required to file an affidavit with the college or university stating that they have applied to legalize their immigration status or will apply as soon as they become eligible to do so. The state Board of Governors’ eligibility criteria are very similar to those in a California law, enacted in 2001, which allows illegal or undocumented students who meet the eligibility requirements to pay in-state tuition. In Rhode Island, legislation to extend in-state tuition to undocumented students has failed in the General Assembly every year since 2004, but the Board of Governors took up the issue as a matter of policy. The board has amended its in-state tuition policy six times since 1971. One of those changes, in 2003, allowed certain classes of refugees who have lived in Rhode Island for at least one year to be eligible for in-state tuition rates. The federal law Gorman contends that the only way public colleges can allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates and still comply with federal law would be to offer the in-state rate to all students who are citizens, regardless of whether or not they live in that state. That’s essentially the same argument made by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that seeks to stop illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration, and which unsuccessfully challenged in-state tuition laws in Kansas and California. (More on those later.) The federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Reconciliation Act of 1996 -- codified in Title 8, chapter 14 of the federal code -- sets out the conditions for granting post-secondary education benefits to illegal immigrants based on residence in sections 1621 and 1623. Section 1623, which Gorman cited, states that someone who is not lawfully in the United States "shall not be eligible on the basis of residence . . . for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident." The section goes on to say that states can grant undocumented immigrants public benefits that they otherwise would not qualify for if the state enacts a law to do so. To date, 12 states, including Connecticut, have enacted laws to allow undocumented students to be eligible to pay in-state tuition. The others are California, Texas, Utah, New York, Washington, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Maryland. (A similar law in Wisconsin enacted in 2009 was repealed this year.) Legal challenges The Federation for American Immigration Reform filed suit in federal district court in Kansas contending that Kansas’ in-state tuition law discriminated against U.S. citizens who lived outside of Kansas. A federal district court judge in 2005 denied the plaintiffs’ claims without ruling on the merits of the case. Rather, the judge said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in federal court. The following year, the group filed suit on the same grounds in California. The case eventually wound up in the California Supreme Court, where the judges ruled in 2010 that the California law was not discriminatory and did not violate federal law. The judges based their ruling on section 1623 of the federal law, which states that someone who is in the country illegally cannot be eligible for any post-secondary benefit on the basis of residence. In their decision, the California judges concluded that the basis upon which California granted the in-state tuition exemption -- which includes having attended a California high school for at least three years and obtaining a high school diploma or GED from California -- constituted criteria other than residency. Therefore, the judges wrote, "it does not violate section 1623." The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case on appeal. The California court did not, however, rule on whether granting in-state tuition for undocumented students amounted to a "benefit" as defined in the federal law. That remains an open question. Legislation to either restrict or permit access to public education for undocumented immigrants is currently pending in several states. And groups on both sides of the issue are mounting more legal challenges. Judicial Watch, a Washington-based conservative legal group, challenged Maryland’s in-state tuition law. A state court dismissed the suit for lack of standing; the group is appealing. A Rhode Island wrinkle? One aspect of Rhode Island’s situation that could complicate matters if the policy is challenged in court is that Rhode Island -- unlike the other 12 states -- never passed a state law. The 1996 federal law (Title 8, section 1621) says that a state can provide someone who is in the country illegally with state or local "benefit" for which they would otherwise be ineligible -- but only if the state enacts legislation to do so. The question not yet answered by the courts: Is in-state tuition a "benefit" under the law the same as welfare or unemployment compensation? And if so, does Rhode Island need to enact a state law to grant it to undocumented students? Our ruling The practice of offering in-state tuition to undocumented students promises to be the subject of more court battles. For now, though, Gorman’s statement that granting in-state tuition violates federal law should be evaluated in light of three key facts: * The only court which has directly addressed whether granting in-state tuition to undocumented students conforms with federal law is the California Supreme Court. And that court ruled there was no violation of federal law. * The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the California decision, so the decision stands. * A dozen states have enacted state laws to support tuition policies similar to the one approved in Rhode Island. In two states -- California and Texas -- the laws have been in effect for a decade. None has been successfully challenged. While we reserve the right to reconsider the issue if further court challenges yield different results, for now we rule Gorman’s statement Mostly False. (To comment on this ruling, "like" us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.) Update: On Oct. 2, 2011, we revised the wording of one of the key facts in our ruling to make it clear that a dozen states have enacted state laws to make undocumented students eligible for in-state tuition at public colleges.

pomt-13235	"State Department officials actually directed contracts for the Haitian recovery after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/mike-pence/pence-wrong-haiti-contracts-steered-clinton-friend/	For Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, recently revealed State Department emails are a smoking gun that prove how Clinton Foundation donors cashed in on their political connections. And Pence was clearly frustrated that this alleged pay-for-play is getting little attention. "Revelations coming out of Secretary of State Clinton's years in the State Department and the Clinton Foundation are virtually ignored by the national media," Pence said on Oct. 16, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press. "I mean we discovered this week that State Department officials actually directed contracts for the Haitian recovery effort after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons." Did State Department officials actually steer Haiti relief contracts to friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton? While there was contact between the State Department and friends of the Clintons, we found no evidence of that contracts were actually awarded. We asked the Donald Trump campaign to send us proof and did not hear back. But we did speak to staff at the Republican National Committee, which used the Freedom of Information Act to get State Department emails during the weeks right after the 2010 earthquake. The RNC shared the emails with ABC News and referred us to the ABC News story that emerged. (When we asked, the RNC also shared the emails with us.) RNC Research Director Raj Shah focused on two instances when he said foundation donors "gained access to officials that people who weren’t friends of the Clintons didn’t." But importantly, Shah also said it isn’t clear that those with Clinton ties in fact ultimately won contracts. That is "the case we have to make," Shah said. Let’s look at the two examples. The ABC News story The 2010 earthquake devastated Haiti. Entire city blocks had crumbled. The damage was everywhere, striking hospitals, power systems and the water supply. The world scrambled to respond, and Clinton Foundation donors contacted the foundation. On top of the foundation’s work in Haiti, since 2009, Bill Clinton had been the United Nations special envoy to Haiti. Emails to the foundation made their way to the State Department. Under the headline "How Hillary's State Dept. Gave Special Attention to 'Friends of Bill' After Haiti Quake," the ABC report revealed many instances of State Department staffers giving priority status to people with ties to the Clintons. In one case, Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster, a foundation board member, sent an email to his contacts at the Clinton Foundation. As is laid out in the email, Gonzalez-Bunster hoped to get satellite images of the damage to Haiti’s electric grid to help guide engineers he was sending to do reconstruction work. Literally within a few hours, the Clinton Foundation forwarded the email to the State Department and a State Department staffer had forwarded Gonzalez-Bunster’s email to the chief operating officer of the U.S. Agency for International Development with the subject line "Clinton friend/wanting info." Below that, the email said "Rolando is a close friend of the Secretary and the former President dating back to Georgetown." Did his company get a contract? No. Gonzalez-Bunster told ABC News that all the work to restore power was donated and that later, his company got an award for its effort -- an award for its charity, not a contract to do more work. Then there was Garry Mauro, the Texas state chairman for both of Clinton’s presidential campaigns and a foundation donor -- he gave between $25,000 and $50,000. An associate of Mauro contacted the Clinton Foundation on behalf of DRC Emergency Services, a major disaster relief contractor. That email came with a detailed list of the earthmoving equipment DRC had on the ground in Haiti. That was passed along to the State Department with the advisory, "This is from a partner of Garry Mauro, a friend of WJC (William Jefferson Clinton), offering major assets in Haiti." A second email noted "Garry is also a friend of the Secretary’s." Did DRC get a contract to work in Haiti? Not from the American government. You won’t find the company at all in a comprehensive spreadsheet of Haiti disaster relief contracts from the Federal Procurement Data System. (The company did contract with the U.S. Defense Department in 2011, but we could find no record that the work was related to Haiti.) Company videos show that DRC removed the rubble of collapsed buildings and put up temporary worker housing in Haiti, but there’s no indication that the State Department played a role in that. DRC already had a presence in the country, and as the Miami Herald reported, it knew how to secure contracts directly from the Haitian government. Lastly, the Republican National Committee mentioned former Federal Emergency Management Administration chief James Lee Witt, whose firm won a nearly $100,000 contract within days of the earthquake. The U.S. Agency for International Development wanted a quick initial assessment of the overall damage. The relevance is unclear. Although Witt served during the Clinton administration, he was not mentioned in the State Department emails, and so they don’t shed light on any special treatment. The Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, has criticized the Clintons and the relief work in Haiti. Lead researcher Jake Johnston said there are good reasons to challenge the Clintons’ projects in the country, but while the emails show special notice of foundation donors, they don’t show more than that. "There is no evidence that contracts or U.S. government funding was then ‘directed’ towards any of them (the donors)," Johnston told us. Lastly, we note that we found one anonymous third-hand account on the Breitbart website, a conservative website that supports Trump’s candidacy. That report cites an unnamed friend of an unnamed friend telling John Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador under President George W. Bush, that one company was given preference for a contract. That sort of evidence is the thinnest form of hearsay. Our ruling Pence said that State Department officials steered Haiti relief contracts to friends of the Clintons. That charge rests on a news report based on emails between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. Those emails show only that well-connected people saw their offers of help put on a fast track. Neither the emails nor a search of government contract databases show that the government gave contracts to any of those people or their firms to help in Haiti. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13ded04d-0a5a-41b9-910e-f0fc713ab6e0	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-10-19T18:13:45	2016-10-16	['Bill_Clinton', 'United_States_Department_of_State', 'Haiti']
pomt-02101	"U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/may/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-us-teenagers-behind-ireland-poland-a/	One part of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s resume sets him apart from many of the other potential Republican presidential contenders: a longstanding focus on education policy. As he travels around the country giving speeches -- and titillating political journalists and donors -- Bush has highlighted some of the education policies he advocated during his gubernatorial tenure, which relied heavily on achievement benchmarks, and chastised those who resisted. Bush likes to remind audiences how far Florida came on education benchmarks and how far the nation still has to go to raise its standards. During a May 12 speech at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, Bush said the U.S. lags behind other countries -- including some unexpected nations -- on some key educational measures. "There is nothing more critical to our long-term economic security than a wholesale transformation of our education system," Bush said. "The latest results from the Program for International Student Assessment, better known as PISA, only confirm the urgency of our charge." He continued, "U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science. Between 2003 and 2012, the United States flatlined its results, but many other countries have made a command focus on this. ... There have been more resources placed in this, and they have higher expectations of their children, and they have gotten a better result. So for those that think … poverty is the reason why we haven’t had the educational gains, I guess we should really look to the wealthy countries like Vietnam to determine whether we should be successful. Come on!" We thought we’d check whether Bush was correct that teenagers in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam rank higher than their U.S. counterparts in math and science. International comparison data Bush cited the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which includes every member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of advanced industrialized nations -- as well as some non-member countries. In the United States, PISA is conducted by the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics. The United States sampled schools nationwide. For the United States and the countries Bush cited, the data includes students at both public and private schools. PISA compares 15-year-olds from more than 60 countries in math, science and reading every three years. The study rates students’ levels of proficiency between 1 and 6 -- with 6 being the highest. Nine percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA math proficiency level 5 or higher, while in Poland it was 17 percent, Vietnam 13 percent and Ireland 11 percent. In science, 7 percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA science proficiency level 5 or higher. In Poland and Ireland, 11 percent of teenagers hit that mark. In Vietnam, however, the percent hitting that proficiency level was 8. That’s just one point above the United States, a level that’s not considered "measurably different," according to a research analyst at NCES. Education experts weigh in on PISA We sent Bush’s claim to a few education experts and asked whether they had any concerns about the PISA evaluations or Bush’s interpretations of the data. "Unfortunately (for the country), he is dead right," said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of a book that includes a discussion of how such international test results are related to economic growth. "I am convinced that it is a good index of important skills, particularly the math and science scores." Jason Amos, a spokesman for the Alliance for Excellent Education, a policy organization that focuses on at-risk high school students, said Bush "is citing PISA correctly." University of Iowa education professor David Bills said, "The big question for me is that the distribution in the U.S. is so different than the countries we’re being compared with. The U.S. just tolerates a lot of really low achievement, overwhelmingly among poorer kids." While top American students are internationally competitive, "relative to other countries we badly underinvest in poor kids," Bills said. "That tends to bring the overall mean down, mainly because U.S. scores are just much more skewed than they are elsewhere." Like any educational assessment, PISA does have its critics, and much of the criticism has focused on either a general backlash against the "escalation of testing" or debate about whether PISA’s No. 1 ranking of China stems from its focus on Shanghai, a comparatively wealthy city. Yong Zhao, University of Oregon education professor, has written several blog posts critical of PISA, saying the comparison "glorifies educational authoritarianism." Zhao told PolitiFact that the statistics cited by Bush are correct. However, he said that his statement that U.S. teenagers "have now fallen behind" counterparts in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam is misleading. "The U.S. PISA rankings were below Ireland and Poland in 2003, and Vietnam did not participate until 2012. So the U.S. has not fallen behind. ... in terms of international test scores, the U.S. has always had poor performance, behind many countries. So there is no "falling behind." (You can read more about his argument in his "Numbers can lie" blog.) Our ruling Bush said that "U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science." Bush correctly cites data from PISA showing the United States trails the three countries in question. But it’s not so much that the United States has "fallen behind" -- the U.S. has been behind Ireland and Poland for years, and Vietnam was first tested in 2012. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2014-05-15T17:13:56	2014-05-12	['United_States', 'Poland', 'Republic_of_Ireland', 'Vietnam']
pomt-09036	Said he is the only Democratic candidate for state attorney general who has "represented the entire state of Georgia."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/06/rob-teilhet/did-lawmaker-cobb-represent-entire-state/	Politicians are always looking for an edge in a close race. In the contest between the two Democrats for attorney general, candidate Rob Teilhet is using his time under the Gold Dome to try to claim an advantage over his opponent, Ken Hodges. Elected four consecutive times since 2002 to serve a portion of Cobb County in the Georgia Legislature, Teilhet said in a questionnaire that he "represented" the entire state. "As the only Democratic candidate (for attorney general) who has represented the entire state of Georgia, I'm uniquely positioned to introduce and implement groundbreaking public policy designed to curtail crime, consumer fraud and public corruption," Teilhet wrote. We were curious about this one. Teilhet explained. "You are elected to represent a district, but you also serve the state of Georgia," he said. Teilhet pointed us to the oath of office for the 180-member state House of Representatives. Here's the first part of the oath: "I do hereby solemnly swear or affirm that I will support the Constitution of this state and of the United States and, on all questions and measures which may come before me, I will so conduct myself, as will, in my judgment, be most conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state." So does Teilhet represent the entire state as he claimed? Teilhet was elected by voters from a portion of east Cobb County that includes Marietta, Smyrna and the Dobbins Air Reserve Base. He has been in the Legislature since 2003. The Hodges camp duly noted the boundaries of Teilhet's district as part of its argument against his claim. "It's the first line in his campaign bio," Shannon Marietta, Hodges' campaign manager, wrote in an e-mail. Hodges, who served 12 years as Dougherty County's district attorney, had to pledge that he would support the Georgia Constitution. The state constitution says representatives should be elected from "representative districts of the state." They have the power to write local legislation and the mandate to approve a balanced budget. They do not have the power to approve contracts or regulate charges for public utilities. Teilhet worked with other House members on about two dozen pieces of legislation earlier this year that were designed to have an impact across the state, such as a bill to take DNA samples of people accused of felonies -- that bill failed. A handful focused on issues that were of particular interest to Cobb residents, such as a bill imposing up to 20 years in prison for theft in a disaster area. Cobb County was hardest hit during September's record flooding. He also wrote about a dozen resolutions that ranged from commending the county manager, David Hankerson, to honoring the South Cobb High School marching band for performing at President Barack Obama's inauguration. George Hooks, whose 20 years in the Georgia Senate is longer than that of any of his colleagues, said lawmakers have dual roles of representing the district and constituents across Georgia. Sometimes, Hooks said, he supports legislation that people in his South Georgia district may not like, but it benefits the state, such as a bill earlier this year that could offer new funding sources for transportation. "I voted for it because I see it as benefiting the state," Hooks said. "If it benefits Atlanta, it will benefit the state." University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, whom Teilhet said was one of his college professors, said some representatives work as "trustees," serving the interests of everyone. Others act as "delegates," taking care of the people in their home district. Steve Anthony, who has worked at the state Capitol and is a lecturer at Georgia State University, believes Teilhet is "playing loose with verbiage." "If he had said he represented the interests of the state of Georgia, he would be correct," Anthony said. "He didn't represent Georgia. He represented the interests of Georgia." Anthony also took issue with the second part of Teilhet's statement, saying the candidate cannot introduce legislation as attorney general. "He can get some friend to introduce it for him." Teilhet replied: "By that standard, the governor has never introduced a bill." Teilhet and others have different interpretations about the role of members of the Georgia House of Representatives. The state constitution does not say whether representatives are elected to serve the entire state. The oath does say that representatives should work toward goals that are "conducive to the interests and prosperity of this state." Teilhet said he has talked on the campaign trail about the oath of office directing representatives to serve the interests of the state. "Maybe that would have been a little tighter [to say in the questionnaire]," Teilhet said. We agree that Teilhet would have been better served if he said he represented the "interests" of the state. As even Hooks said, Teilhet's statement is "broad." We rate Teilhet's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rob Teilhet	None	None	None	2010-07-06T06:00:00	2010-06-05	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-06922	"Federal law requires that hospitals treat people whether or not they can pay. So someone (who) doesn’t have health insurance -- they can go to the hospital and get free care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-federal-laws-requires-hospitals-p/	Responding to a question about health care at a Wolfeboro, N.H., town hall, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney defended the health care law he signed in Massachusetts, saying it was partly a response to people who took advantage of a federal law that allows them to get free emergency coverage. The former governor told the crowd he expanded health coverage in the Bay State in part so citizens could "take personal responsibility" for their health care. "We found that because of federal law, federal law requires that hospitals treat people whether or not they can pay. So someone (who) doesn’t have health insurance -- they can go to the hospital and get free care. And we found a growing number of people were dropping their insurance and going to the hospital if they got real sick." Whether hospitals were properly compensated for treating the poor was one of the issues the Massachusetts health care law tried to address. In this case, we wondered if Romney was accurately describing the federal law and whether it truly equates with free care. His campaign told us he was referring to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act., which Congress passed in 1986. It says any hospital that receives Medicare dollars (and nearly 90 percent of hospitals in the United States do) must "provide a medical screening examination" for an emergency condition "regardless of an individual's ability to pay." The American College of Emergency Physicians defines an emergency as "a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual's health (or the health of an unborn child) in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of bodily organs." If the patient’s symptoms qualify as an emergency, the law says "hospitals are required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients." So what does "stabilizing treatment for patients" mean in practice? Matt Fenwick with the American Hospital Association says it means "your condition has been stabilized. (Medical providers) have done everything they can do to make sure your condition is not getting any worse." But there’s no guarantee a hospital will provide some level of treatment, even if a person is really sick, says George Washington University health policy professor Sara Rosenbaum. "For example, you bring a child who is running a fever and has a sore throat. They say that’s not an emergency. If it turns out the sore throat is very fast-moving strep, which can happen with little children, your child could be dead by night." Rosenbaum says whether a patient actually gets treatment can be a matter of lucky timing and whether they show up at the emergency room just as the medical concern has blossomed into a true emergency. She said that even when a person receives some care, there often is a big gap between stabilizing a patient’s condition and providing them with treatment. Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a health analyst with the Rand Corporation, a policy think tank, echoes that sentiment. He says a patient "will be stabilized and if necessary hospitalized. They are not entitled to primary care, they are not entitled to preventive care, they are not entitled to followup. That is more humane then letting people die in the gutter. But it is a ridiculous way to try to manage a health care system." Our ruling Romney said that federal law "requires that hospitals treat people whether or not they can pay. So someone doesn’t have health insurance they can go to the hospital and get free care." Experts told us that one aspect of Romney's argument has some validity: Many people rely on emergency rooms for care when they have nowhere else to go, which is expensive and a burden on the health care system and the larger society. And hospitals sometimes provide more free care than the law requires. But Romney is wrongly suggesting more extensive treatment is required by federal law. He implies that hospitals are required to provide more free care than is actually mandated. In fact, the law just requires stabilizing treatment in an emergency. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00527	"This type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/	After a gunman shot and killed nine worshippers in a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama took to the White House podium the next day to "express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders." In his June 18, 2015, remarks from the White House, Obama said, "Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let’s be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it." A flurry of PolitiFact readers -- some of them prompted by articles objecting to Obama’s claim -- wrote to us to ask us to check it, so we did. An important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of Obama’s claim -- that "this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries." As we’ll explain, the critics have a point here -- mass violence, including mass shootings, happen in a wide variety of countries. However, the critics have truncated the quotation, leaving off the next sentence -- that "it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency." That’s also not fully correct, but it’s not quite as wrong as the first claim. The White House argues that Obama's second sentence qualifies the first, and added that PunditFact rated Mostly True the claim that "Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries." However, that claim refers to gun violence generally, not mass killings specifically, the topic of Obama's comment. For a look at the statistics, we checked with two researchers, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. They have been collecting and analyzing mass-shooting incidents in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2014. Aside from the United States, the countries they studied are Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. (They also looked at less-developed countries, but we will exclude those since Obama specifically mentioned "advanced" countries.) Schildkraut and Elsass shared the summary information from their database with PolitiFact. Here’s their table: The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China. Still, using this data, it’s easy to dispense with the first claim Obama made -- that "this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries." Over the decade and a half studied, the researchers found 23 incidents of mass shootings in the other 10 countries, resulting in 200 dead and 231 wounded. In the United States over the same period, there were 133 incidents that left 487 dead and 505 wounded. Here are a just a few examples of mass shootings in other countries: • On July 22, 2011, a total of 80 people were killed in Norway when Anders Behring Breivik, a political extremist, bombed a government building in Oslo and then went on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoya, just outside the city. • On March 11, 2009, in Winnenden, Germany, a teenage gunman killed 15 people. The majority of the victims were children and teachers killed when the shooter opened fire in three classrooms in a local secondary school. The gunman shot two other people before killing himself after being cornered by the local police. • On Sept. 23, 2008, in Kuahajoki, Finland, a gunman shot 10 people to death after opening fire on a classroom in the Kuahajoki School of Hospitality. After killing the students, the shooter burned the victims’ bodies. In sum, then, Obama is wrong to say that "this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries." Clearly it does happen elsewhere, and not in trivial numbers. Seven of the countries saw double-digit numbers of people killed in mass shootings during that period. By contrast, the second part of Obama’s claim -- that "it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency" -- isn’t entirely off-base. We compared mass shooting incidents across countries is to calculate the number of victims per capita -- that is, adjusted for the country’s total population size. Calculating it this way shows the United States in the upper half of the list of 11 countries, ranking higher than Australia, Canada, China, England, France, Germany and Mexico. Still, the U.S. doesn’t rank No. 1. At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the U.S. had a lower rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000). We’ll note that all of these countries had one or two particularly big attacks and have relatively small populations, which have pushed up their per-capita rates. In Norway, that single attack in 2011 left 67 dead by gunfire (plus additional bomb casualties). Finland had two attacks, one that killed eight and one that killed 10. And Switzerland had one incident that killed 14. Still, while the United States did rank in the top one-third of the list, the fact that three other countries exceeded the United States using this method of comparison does weaken Obama’s claim that "it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency." In at least three countries, the data shows, it does. Elsass warned PolitiFact of a few caveats about the data. While they believe their database "to be among the most exhaustive compilations available," Elsass noted that it may not include every instance of mass shootings. It also doesn’t include every example of mass killings -- just those committed by firearms, even though mass stabbings are not uncommon in such places as China. Finally, their database doesn’t include acts generally considered to be terrorism, such as the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. "If these were included, we are likely to see something much different statistically as there have been a number of very high-profile terrorist attacks in Europe, some including the use of firearms, that are excluded from the current analysis," she said. But in all likelihood, this would only make the case against Obama’s claim stronger. The bottom line is that it’s unwise to take these numbers as gospel -- but the figures from this database are clear enough to cast significant doubt on the accuracy of the specific claim Obama made. Our ruling Obama said after the church shootings in Charleston that "this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency." The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014. The only partial support for Obama’s claim is that the per-capita gun-incident fatality rate in the United States does rank in the top one-third of the list of 11 countries studied. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. EDITOR’S NOTE, June 22, 2015: We heard from several of you regarding Obama's use of the word "frequency," and that frequency could refer to the incidents of mass shootings, not deaths as we examined. Looking at Obama's claim by incident, the United States has a higher rate of incidents than Finland, Norway and Switzerland. We agree that there is no preferred comparison and each is valid, and we've changed some language in this article to reflect that. We also agree that China has a larger population than the United States, a fact we weren't initially clear about but have since fixed. That said, we are sticking with our rating of Mostly False, in large measure because of Obama's claim that "this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries." That is incorrect. We know some of you will disagree, and we'll be sure to air out some of your objections in our next reader mailbag. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/25a98008-681f-4dbe-bb34-834523972eeb	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-06-22T10:54:04	2015-06-18	['None']
pomt-04780	The Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare "does not affect" benefits for anyone 55 or older.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/24/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-his-plan-would-not-affect-current-m/	Paul Ryan knew he would get a big response when, during a rally for Mitt Romney at a Florida retirement community, he asked people to raise their hands if they are 55 or over. He wanted to reassure the seniors in the crowd about the Republican presidential ticket’s plans for Medicare, the government health insurance program serving 39 million seniors. "Our solution to preserve, protect and save Medicare does not affect your benefits," Ryan, Romney’s vice presidential pick, said during an Aug. 18, 2012, stop at The Villages. "Let me repeat that -- our plan does not affect the benefits for people who are in or near retirement." Really? The truth is not as clear as Ryan makes it appear. We know Ryan and Romney are pushing for Medicare reforms that would spare beneficiaries 55 and over. Their proposals would create voucher-like credits for future retirees to shop for their own plans, either traditional Medicare or a private plan, starting in 2023. If Ryan were talking only about this part of the plan, he'd be correct. But Romney and Ryan have also pledged to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act, which Ryan attacked several times during his comments. The health law included several new benefits for Medicare. Here’s an overview of what Obama's health law offers Medicare beneficiaries: Preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. Everyone on Medicare is now eligible for free preventive care as a result of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Seniors’ annual wellness visits would be covered, as well as flu shots and a number of screenings for cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, HIV, and cholesterol (complete list is here). These services would not require co-pays. The ‘doughnut hole.’ The law gradually closes the so-called "doughnut hole" for seniors on the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program over 10 years. Before the law, seniors whose annual drug costs exceeded $2,830 shouldered the entire payment without government assistance until they hit an out of pocket limit of $4,550. Once "catastrophic coverage" is triggered, the government paid 95 percent of costs. The health care law gives beneficiaries who reach the doughnut hole a $250 tax-free rebate. Federal subsidies will kick in, gradually reducing the patient’s share of the payment from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020. Plus, seniors in the doughnut hole receive a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs. Restoring $716 billion in Medicare cost savings. Romney has said he will replenish $716 billion in Medicare spending reductions in the health care law over the next decade. Some analysts say reinstating the savings will will drive up premiums for Medicare Part B beneficiaries, reported the New York Times on Aug. 21, 2012. Premiums are pegged to Medicare’s overall costs, so when costs go up, premiums go up. Marilyn Moon, vice president and director of the health program at the American Institutes for Research, used official data to compute how out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries might increase. We reached Moon, and she reviewed her methodology with us. She calculated that restoring the Medicare spending would raise co-payments and premiums by by $342 a year on average over the next 10 years. By 2022, the annual increase would rise to $577. The Romney campaign did not refute the Times story. Instead they pointed us to Romney’s campaign website and a memo from campaign policy director Lanhee Chan. The memo criticizes the Medicare reductions, saying the reduced payments to hospitals will jeopardize seniors’ care and that people on Medicare Advantage, the private-public plan, will lose their coverage. Romney and Ryan have argued the health care law will hurt seniors, and that it’s better for the market to determine what doctors and hospitals should be paid. But repealing the law will affect seniors, too. Our ruling Ryan wants seniors to know his and Romney’s Medicare plan "does not affect your benefits." Indeed, that’s the case for their Medicare reform ideas, which would not affect people currently 55 and older. But his assurance does not take into account one very large elephant in the room: the federal health care law, which alters Medicare primarily by extending more benefits and savings. Romney and Ryan want to "repeal and replace Obamacare," but they haven’t said with what. Repealing the law would take away benefits for current enrollees. Some experts say it’s unrealistic to expect that level of policy detail. Maybe so, but until the leaders expound upon their plans for closing the doughnut hole for prescription drugs, as well as a number of other Affordable Care Act provisions that would disappear with repeal, we think it’s unrealistic to assure seniors their Medicare provisions wouldn’t change under a Romney-Ryan administration.

pomt-09470	"We are now seeing a decrease in violent crime."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/02/charlie-crist/crist-says-violent-crime-decreased-past-three-year/	During his term as governor, Charlie Crist has pushed for new legislation to crack down on criminals. Now he says that effort has paid off with a decrease in violent crime. During his State of the State speech on March 2, 2010, Crist told a joint session of the Legislature: "With your help, during the first three years of my administration we made Florida a much safer place for our most vulnerable citizens. You enacted the Anti-Murder Act and improved the Jessica Lunsford Act, striking back at violent criminals and sexual predators of children. Fellow Floridians, I am happy to report we are now seeing a decrease in violent crime." To examine crime rates since he took office in January 2007, we turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Uniform Crime Reports. They showed that the violent crime rate per 100,000 dropped from 705.8 in 2006, the year before Crist took office, to 670.3 in 2008, the last year with full statistics. That's clearly a decrease, and matches a nationwide decline. For the first six months of 2009, the FDLE's semi-annual uniform crime reports showed a 9.7 percent drop in violent crime compared to 2008. The FBI's state-by-state report in 2008, "Crime in the United States," also showed drops in the violent crime rate in Florida per 100,000 people though with slightly different numbers: 722.6 in 2007 to 688.9 in 2008. We are not addressing whether the laws Florida legislators passed directly led to a lower violent crime rate -- that's often a matter of debate among criminal justice experts. But the most recent crime reports do show a decrease in violent crime per capita between 2006 and 2008 and that trend appears to have continued in 2009. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03940	"The group that supported the president’s health care bill the most? Latinos."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/20/david-plouffe/david-plouffe-says-latinos-supported-health-care-l/	A grande problemo for the Republican Party is how to win over Hispanic voters who flocked to President Barack Obama in 2012. But even with Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio supporting immigration reform, Latinos are still concerned about other issues, said David Plouffe, a recently departed White House senior adviser. For a New York Times magazine cover story about the Republican Party’s future, Plouffe was asked if a presidential candidate like Rubio could get his party back into the game. Plouffe called Rubio "the tea party Cuban-American from Florida" and said he wouldn’t have much appeal to Hispanic voters in other states. "And by the way: the bigger problem they’ve got with Latinos isn’t immigration," Plouffe said in the February article. "It’s their economic policies and health care. The group that supported the president’s health care bill the most? Latinos." His statement that Latinos supported Obama’s Affordable Care Act more than other groups caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. Polls about the Affordable Care Act We reviewed several polls about the Affordable Care Act and generally found Latinos were supportive of the law. Two of the polls we examined showed blacks with the highest support, followed (sometimes closely) by Hispanics, while whites supported the law much less. Some polling experts told us, though, that the statistical differences between black and Hispanic support were not always significant. We focused most of our search between March 2010 when the law was signed and the November 2012 election. Here are a few examples: • Polls of only Latinos: We were unable to reach Plouffe, who has since left the White House, directly. But a spokesman at the White House sent us links to two polls. A Fox News Latino poll in September 2012 found 62 percent of likely Latino voters supported the Affordable Care Act. A poll by Latino Decisions shortly before the election found 61 percent of Latinos felt the law should be allowed to stand. • Kaiser Family Foundation: This poll has repeatedly asked respondents if they had a generally favorable or unfavorable view of the law. In November 2012, it showed that among blacks 68 percent had a favorable view, while 52 percent of Hispanics favored it. But Hispanic notched 1 percent higher than blacks on their favorable view in April 2010, just after the Act was signed into law -- 68 to 67 percent. The favorability view of whites has fluctuated much less: 39 percent in April 2010 and 35 percent in November 2012. Mollyann Brodie, a Kaiser senior vice president, told PolitiFact in an email: "While in a couple of months the gaps you see are ‘statistically different,’ for the most part there is NO statistical difference between black and Hispanic support. So I think it would be wrong to suggest that in general blacks are more supportive than Hispanics, and the more accurate way to talk about our data is that blacks and Hispanics are more favorable towards the Affordable Care Act than white non-Hispanics." • Quinnipiac: In May 2010 a Quinnipiac poll asked "Do you approve or disapprove of the federal health care overhaul?" It found that 68 percent of blacks approved of the law while 52 percent of Hispanics did. Polls in 2012 showed that blacks favored letting the health care law stand more than Hispanics -- in February 68 to 42 percent and in July 73 to 52 percent. Harvard School of Public Health professor Robert Blendon, who reviewed the Quinnipiac results, said the July 2012 survey had a large sample. "Hispanics in that question are statistically different from blacks. They are lower in their level of support," he said. "That survey had a very large sample. In the others, you can say that the bill was not more significantly popular among Hispanics than for blacks." Interpreting the polls Opinions about the health care law tended to polarize along partisan lines. "The No. 1 characteristic that has defined opinion on law since the day it passed is political party affiliation," said Brodie, the polling expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Democrats always disproportionately like it and Republicans always disproportionately hate it by huge percentages. African-Americans and Latinos are much more likely to be Democrats, and Democrats like this idea." Gabe Sanchez, a University of New Mexico political science professor who works for Latino Decisions, said Latinos and blacks have supported the law more than whites due to higher national average rates of being uninsured and knowing more people who lack insurance. Hispanics have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group within the U.S., according to the federal Office of Minority Health. Blendon said results from Quinnipiac show that Hispanics supported the law more than whites, but not as much as blacks. He said a possible reason could be the requirement that all people have health insurance, called the individual mandate. "Hispanics have more self-employed and small businesses in their communities and this concern about the mandate’s impact economically for them may be a reason here," he said. Jennifer Ng'andu, an expert on health and civil rights policy at the National Council of La Raza, which supported the final law, told PolitiFact in an email that "In general, every poll that I’ve seen both during and following the passage of the Affordable Care Act confirms that black support for the Affordable Care Act was higher than Latinos." But Hispanics showed strong support for health care reform nn general. Our ruling When Plouffe was talking about Obama’s support among Latinos he said, "The group that supported the president’s health care bill the most? Latinos." The White House pointed to polls of Latino voters showing the majority supported the health care law, but that lacked a comparison to other groups. Overall, the polls we looked at showed strong support for the health care law from Hispanics. However, we found little to suggest Hispanics supported the law "the most." Support for the law among blacks was very high and in some cases outpaced Hispanic support. Experts we spoke with said that blacks supported the health care law the most or that they were fairly equal in support with Hispanics. Support for the law tended to follow partisan lines. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	David Plouffe	None	None	None	2013-02-20T13:55:29	2013-02-17	['None']
pomt-13840	"Condemning violence against the police and urging support for the police" is "markedly absent" from President Barack Obama’s public remarks.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/12/william-johnson/law-enforcement-lobbyist-says-pro-police-speech-ma/	After five police officers were killed in an attack in Dallas, critics targeted President Barack Obama’s rhetoric on policing and police brutality. It’s a huge departure from the past, when political leaders spoke out forcefully against brutality against law enforcement, said William Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, which lobbies on behalf of a variety of police unions and associations, on Fox News July 8, the morning after the shooting. "I think one of the big differences then was you had governors and mayors and the president — whether it was President Johnson or President Nixon, Republican or Democrat — condemning violence against the police and urging support for the police. "Today that's markedly absent," Johnson continued. "I think that's a huge difference, and that's directly led to the climate that allows these attacks to happen." Johnson says that Obama has not supported the police or condemned violence against them. That’s a serious charge, and a quick look at the public record shows this isn’t true. Johnson’s comment came before Obama announced he would attend a July 12 memorial for the fallen police officers. What Obama has said We’ll start with what he said after the murders of the Dallas officers July 7. Speaking from Warsaw, Poland, Obama condemned violence against police and praised police officers in seven hours after the Dallas attack. "As I told Mayor (Mike) Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas," Obama said. Obama also spoke the day before the Dallas attacks in response to the shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana by police officers. Most of the statement focused on the need for reform in policing, but Obama also addressed the idea that police were under attack in the debate about excessive force. "And so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job. We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives," Obama said. That’s just what Obama has said on this topic in the past week. During the Baltimore riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, Obama spoke against the violence and expressed his sympathy for police officers in Baltimore. "My heart goes out to the police officers who were injured in the past few days. They showed extraordinary restraint ... it shows how tough a job policing can be," Obama said. Obama also issued a statement after two New York police officers were shot by a man who claimed to be acting in response to the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police. He actually used the word "condemn." "I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City," Obama said. "Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day." Here are several other examples: Before a meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 2015, Obama said: "I reject any narrative that seeks to divide police and communities that they serve. I reject a storyline that says when it comes to public safety there’s an ‘us’ and a ‘them’ –- a narrative that too often gets served up to us by news stations seeking ratings, or tweets seeking retweets, or political candidates seeking some attention." A May 8, 2015, White House proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week read: "As President, I am committed to making sure America's dedicated police officers receive the support and recognition they have earned, and to doing all I can to protect those who protect us." In response to violence in the St. Louis-area after the shooting of Michael Brown, Obama said: "There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting." You can read more of Obama’s comments about police in this 2014 fact-check. NAPO’s complaints We tried to reach out to Johnson and did not hear back. But on July 12, his organization posted a lengthy statement about a meeting it had with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden "in direct response to NAPO’s statement accusing the Administration of not fully supporting our nation’s law enforcement officers," a statement published on NAPO’s website said. The NAPO account of the meeting has the president asking how he could have better responded to police shootings. Johnson said the administration had failed to address violence and threats against police that he linked to Black Lives Matter. In his account — much more measured than Johnson’s critique on Fox — Johnson acknowledged that the administration had condemned violence against police officers, but he said it had only done so after officers had been killed. "There has been no response, no condemnation when Black Lives Matter protests turn violent. There was no outrage when two St. Louis County police officers were shot by a Ferguson protester who was at a Black Lives Matter protest. There is no demand for accountability from the movement when members support violence towards police or even act on those calls for violence," NAPO’s statement reads. This speaks directly to Johnson’s broader critique of Obama’s response to violence against police, but it seems to get some details wrong. As noted above, Obama has spoken out against violent protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, though no officers died in either of those protests. After two officers were shot in Ferguson in March of 2015, Obama issued this response on Twitter: "Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together." In response to a question after the Dallas attack about the tactics of Black Lives Matter protesters, Obama said he did not think it was fair to blame the entire movement for the statements of some of its members. "Now, in a movement like Black Lives Matter, there’s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid, or imprudent, or overgeneralized, or harsh. And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site," Obama said. Johnson also said that former Attorney General Eric Holder had undermined police officers in his response to the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Brown in Ferguson. Holder had said that he wanted lower standards of proof for civil rights crimes, like the one the Department of Justice had considered charging Wilson with. But this is tangentially related to the question of how Obama responded to violence against police. Looking back in time Johnson mentioned presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson as models of presidents who had police officers’ backs. Nixon and Johnson both served at a time when violence against police was much more common than it is today. During the 1970s, an average of 127 police officers were shot and killed every year, higher than the average of 71 in the 1960s and much higher than 53 this decade.The overall crime rate was higher in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it is today, and the nation faced large-scale riots in many urban centers. In this context, Nixon and Johnson both expressed support for police officers and laid out programs to support them. Nixon made support for the police a central part of his "law and order" message in his electoral campaigns. In 1970, Nixon issued a statement saying he was "deeply concerned with the growing problem of assaults on police officers." Johnson, Nixon and Obama’s shared support for police was typical of other presidents and politicians, according to Jeremy Mayer, a professor at George Mason University who has written on presidential politics in the last half of the 20th century. "What differentiates American politicians, somewhat in the ‘60s and even more today, is the degree of sympathy which they express for the victims of police brutality," Mayer said. "But even the politicians who are sympathetic to the victims of police brutality always or almost always simultaneously express support for the vast majority of police officers." Obama has been more likely than either Nixon or Johnson, Mayer said, to combine his statements of support for the police with concerns about police brutality and discriminatory policing. Our ruling Johnson said Obama had failed to condemn violence against police. Obama has repeatedly condemned violence against police. Most recently, he expressed his support for police the night before the Dallas attack happened, amid protests over two police shootings of black men, and again after the sniper attack on police officers.

pomt-14007	"Congressman Joe Heck has (voted) 62% of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/jun/03/sharron-angle/notwithstanding-bunnies-reagan-new-sharron-angle-a/	In a television ad invoking Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump and bunnies, repeat U.S. Senate candidate Sharron Angle is on the attack against her primary opponent and the race’s presumed frontrunner, Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Heck. After reading a Reagan quote about rabbits and tigers, Angle’s ad accuses Heck of aligning with Democrats a majority of the time. "Congressman Joe Heck has been a D.C. rabbit for the past five years, voting 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues," Angle says in the ad. The ad is certainly a provocative shot with Nevada’s primary election quickly approaching and Angle trailing in polls, so we were interested in seeing just how often Heck ended up on the same side as the House’s Democratic leader. Scoreboards Angle’s campaign referred to Heck’s 39 percent "Liberty Score" ranking on the Conservative Review website as support for the ad. The group calculates the score though 50 "top" votes through a rolling six-year window. The website hasn’t been Heck’s biggest fan, with the site’s editor-in-chief Mark Levin endorsing Angle and releasing a video saying he "opposed conservative values on most issues of importance." Heck’s campaign spokesman, Brian Baluta, didn’t comment on Conservative Review’s rating but called the ad "absurd on its face." So under that narrow set of criteria, Heck and Pelosi (with an 11 percent Liberty Score) appear to have relatively similar positions. However, Heck’s overall voting record is nowhere close to being as aligned to Pelosi as the ad suggests. A CQ Roll Call query shows Heck and Pelosi voting together roughly 31 percent of the time since the Republican entered Congress in 2011. The percentage is even worse for the most recent congressional session — the two only matched up on 25 percent of roll call votes. Other conservative-leaning groups tend to rank Heck somewhere in the middle of Republican House members, with ranking Pelosi much lower. Heritage Action Fund, which grades congressional members on conservative votes, bill co-sponsorships and other legislative activity, gives Heck a 53 percent rating and Pelosi a 16 percent rating. It’s a similar tale with Club for Growth’s legislative scorecard, which gives Heck a 58 percent lifetime score and Pelosi a measly 6 percent score. The American Conservative Union gives Heck a lifetime 64 percent ranking on their scorecard, while Pelosi has a lifetime 2.7 percent lifetime ranking over her congressional career. The ad also shows several rabbits with Heck’s face imposed, seeming to imply that Heck agrees with Pelosi on issues like gun control, Obamacare and amnesty for people not legally in the country. That’s also not the case, as a quick overview of Heck’s record plants him squarely in the Republican orthodoxy on many of the issues that Angle’s ad references. Gun control: Heck has a strong pro-gun record — he’s been endorsed by the National Rifle Association every time he’s run for office, and he voted in favor of the only gun-related legislation considered by the Conservative Review. Amnesty: Though it’s somewhat of a loaded term, Heck has publicly stated support for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. The Republican congressman has said he doesn’t agree with presidential candidate Donald Trump’s plan to deport the roughly 11 million people not legally in the country. Obamacare: Heck — a licensed physician — is generally opposed to the Affordable Care Act and has joined House Republicans in dozens of unsuccessful attempts to repeal all or part of the law. Conservative Review only considers four votes related to health care, including bipartisan legislation increasing Veteran’s Administration spending and an expansion of a grant program for veterinarians. Draft women: This claim is a bit more recent. Heck joined several Democrats in supporting a provision that would require women to begin registering with the Selective Service System for possible involuntary military service. The amendment was killed in a procedural maneuver in May, replaced with a requirement to study future potential needs for a broader military draft system. Our ruling An Angle ad claims Heck has voted 62 percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats on a variety of important issues." Under the narrow parameters of the Conservative Review’s "Liberty Score," Heck and Pelosi do appear to share similar policy priorities. But that only takes into account 50 votes over a six-year period. Other conservative groups with legislative scorecards show a much wider gap between the two, and a review of their cumulative voting records shows a much larger gap in votes. This claim is inaccurate. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cce12a3d-22d7-4490-a2a0-cd0b6bff89a4	None	Sharron Angle	None	None	None	2016-06-03T14:44:01	2016-05-25	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'Joe_Heck', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

Now he says he's in."	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/27/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-daniel-webster/	Before Daniel Webster was for running for Congress, he was against it, his possible Democrat opponent says. Webster, the former Republican Florida House Speaker and Senate Majority Leader, announced he was running for the Florida 8th Congressional District at a rally on April 22, 2010. His announcement produced an immediate reaction from an adviser for incumbent U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando. "Daniel Webster said he's out. Now he says he's in," Tagen said in a statement on behalf of the campaign. "If he flip-flopped on this, will he flip-flop on delivering for the people of our district?" We've already ruled on a claim from Webster's campaign announcement. In this item, we wanted to see if the Grayson retort that Webster already announced he wasn't running is accurate. Indeed, on Oct. 13, 2009, Webster said he was out. Here's his statement: "After much prayer and thoughtful consideration, I have decided not to run for the United States House of Representatives, District 8. This has been a very difficult decision for me personally, especially because of the tremendous outpouring of support that has flooded me from all sides. However, in spite of this incredible encouragement, I still have a certain check in my spirit, prompting me to follow a principle that has always served me well: 'When in doubt, don't.' "I do firmly believe that in every public office there needs to be a resurgence of the basic principles on which this Republic was founded, and a return to our original standards of integrity and character. While I will not be pursuing a place in Congress, I am grateful for the privilege of serving the citizens of Central Florida for 28 years in our state Legislature, and look forward to future opportunities of service." Webster told the Orlando Sentinel he originally opted against running because his family wasn't 100 percent behind the idea. Now they are. Grayson's right. Webster once said he wasn't running. Now, he is. We rate Grayson's statement True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-04-27T16:09:33	2010-04-22	['None']
pomt-01176	Unlike marijuana, medical cannabis oil cannot get you high.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/09/allen-peake/weeding-out-different-effects-cannabis-oil-and-mar/	State lawmakers have a month before they get back to work in the 2015 legislative session and already the debate over medical marijuana has gotten into the, ahem, weeds. State Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon serves as co-chair of a joint legislative committee that has studied whether and how to legalize the drug for certain conditions, including seizures in children. Peake has revived a bill aimed at allowing cannabis oil made from marijuana plants for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. He is finalizing that proposal, pre-filed as House Bill 1 after a similar measure fell short last session. But another committee member, state Sen. Curt Thompson, D-Tucker, is proposing a competing bill that would allow vaporized, edible or smokable marijuana. Thompson also has filed a resolution, calling for a statewide referendum on whether to authorize recreational use of the drug. Confusion about the oil form versus a smokeable drug has prompted Peake, who said he does not support expanded use, to speak out. "We believe that the medical cannabis oil – very low in THC, that doesn’t have a psychoactive component to it, cannot get you high – is a better approach for our citizens," Peake said in a press conference before a committee meeting last week. Opponents of the oil have raised safety concerns. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look at Peake’s contention that the oil extracted from marijuana won’t get users high. First, a reminder that the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, defined as "the most dangerous" drug "with no currently accepted medical use." Despite that designation, 23 states have legalized medical marijuana, allowing access to the drug for a variety of medical conditions. Another 11 states – including neighboring Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee – have enacted laws allowing cannabis oil products for medical reasons in limited situations. The key difference in allowing the oil, supporters say, is that it is high in cannabidiol and low in tetrahydrocannabinol. Both are compounds found in the marijuana plant that act on cell receptors that control neurotransmitters in the brain and the immune system from various organs, such as the spleen. Cannabidiol, known as CBD, is an antioxidant and not psychoactive. Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the long-known mind-altering part of pot. Cannabis oil is made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC. For medical use, the oil is made with less than 3 percent THC and is orally ingested. Children’s doses tend to be at 1 percent THC, or lower. Studies are scarce on the medical benefits of such a product, given the Schedule I classification. But research does show that THC is what brings both it and CBD into the brain, where CBD’s antioxidant properties are thought to protect the brain. That evidence helped the federal Department of Health and Human Services earn a patent on medical marijuana in 2003. Anecdotally, parents of children with epilepsy and other seizure diseases back up the findings, reporting marked improvement from the cannabis oil. A London drug company, GW Pharmaceuticals, has created a drug out of highly purified CBD that has shown in preclinical studies that it potentially reduce seizures. The firm is waiting on final approval from Georgia Regents University and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to begin clinical trials in Georgia with children who have severe seizure disorders. None of the existing studies or anecdotes from parents acknowledge or report any "high" from cannabis oil. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while acknowledging the federal government does not see marijuana as medicine, reports that CBD as a "non-psychoactive cannabinoid" that may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as some inflamation disorders and mental illnesses. In other words, while the medical use of cannabis oil can be debated given the limited number of medical and clinic studies, there is some common ground on the product. Marijuana remains officially a more dangerous drug than cocaine, according to the federal government. But the main component of the plant used to make cannabis oil doesn’t have the mind-altering, munchies-inducing effect associated with street use of the plant. We rate Peake’s statement True.

pomt-05550	Says Obama health reform law denies millions "access to affordable insurance."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/08/eric-hovde/newcomer-and-wisconsin-gop-senate-candidate-eric-h/	President Barack Obama’s health care reform law is supposed to give millions more Americans access to affordable health insurance, right? Eric Hovde, a 2012 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, claims it will have the opposite effect. In a blog post published March 27, 2012, the Wisconsin businessman and political newcomer wrote about the law and a legal challenge to it that the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled decide in June 2012: "You see, Obamacare doesn’t just further bankrupt our nation, raise taxes and deny millions of Americans access to affordable insurance — it flies directly in the face of our Constitution." Let’s check what seems like a counterintuitive claim: That the Affordable Care Act denies "millions of Americans access to affordable insurance." Two preliminary points. -- If the 2010 law is upheld by the court, most of its changes won’t take effect until 2014. That includes a requirement that nearly all people buy health insurance and the creation of insurance "exchanges" where people can buy health insurance, in some cases with a federal subsidy. -- As PolitiFact National noted in a similar claim made by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, the law is expected to increase the number of people with health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projects the number of uninsured Americans will be 29 million to 31 million lower than it would otherwise be without the law. Asked to back the claim, Hovde campaign press secretary Sean Lansing cited Congressional Budget Office projections, as well as a news article about two national surveys of employers. Congressional Budget Office Lansing said the CBO projected in a March 2012 report that as many as 20 million Americans will lose their employer-provided coverage after the health reform law takes full effect. But that’s the worst-case of a series of scenarios presented by the budget office; in another scenario, the number of people who get employer-provided health insurance actually increases by 3 million. What’s important is the budget office’s baseline estimate, or best guess, which is that 3 million to 5 million fewer people in each year from 2019 through 2022 will get health insurance through an employer. But, to be clear, that does not mean they won’t have access to insurance. Employer surveys Lansing provided an August 2011 Associated Press article that reported on two national surveys of employers. Both were conducted by benefits consultants. A Towers Watson survey found that nearly 1 in 10 midsize or large employers expect to stop offering health coverage to workers once federal insurance exchanges start in 2014. And a Mercer survey of large and smaller employers found that 8 percent were either "likely" or "very likely" to end health benefits. So, potentially millions of workers could lose their employer-provided health insurance as a result of the reform law. Lansing argues that means those workers would be denied access to affordable health insurance. But that’s not the whole story. Under the law, workers whose employers stop offering health insurance would have other options. As our colleagues noted in the Priebus item, which was rated Half True: "The people who lose insurance this way won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law. "Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will be able to go onto the exchanges and get guaranteed, and in many cases, subsidized coverage." But there's an even more important point. Hovde’s claim is that the law itself denies the access to affordable care. In the scenarios he cites, it is the employer who would be deciding to drop the employer-sponsored plan. Our rating Hovde said Obama’s health care reform law denies "millions of Americans access to affordable" health insurance. Once the law takes full effect, some employers are expected to stop providing health insurance to their employees. But that's not the same as the law denying people access to affordable health insurance, particularly since other options for obtaining such insurance will be available. We rate Hovde’s claim False.

pomt-03770	"Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/03/thomas-tobin/rhode-island-catholic-bishop-tobin-says-us-supreme/	With two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and two competing bills that would legalize same-sex marriage now before the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement March 27 urging state legislators to delay any action. Tobin, who leads the Diocese of Providence, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage. "In light of the historic deliberations of the U.S. Supreme Court on same-sex marriage, it would be appropriate for the General Assembly of Rhode Island to defer any action on this critical issue for the time being," Tobin said. "Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. It is likely that the Supreme Court will decide this matter for us, one way or another. Let's wait to see what the highest court of the land says about this issue which is so very important to many Rhode Islanders." We were interested in Tobin’s assertion that any legislative action that is taken now by the General Assembly might become "completely null and void" after the Supreme Court's ruling on its two cases. We asked Tobin’s office for an explanation. His spokesman said the bishop was out of town and unavailable. So we started making inquiries. The first Rhode Island proposal would, as a matter of law, replace the civil same-sex unions already legal in Rhode Island with same-sex marriage. That proposal has already passed the Rhode Island House. The second, if approved by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, would call for a referendum on whether to enshrine same-sex marriage into the Rhode Island Constitution, a document that doesn't mention marriage at all. Supporters of same-sex marriage oppose this bill, in part, because it includes protections for businesses that would refuse, on religious grounds, to provide goods and services for same-sex ceremonies. We asked legal experts on both sides of the debate whether any action by the U.S. Supreme Court in the two cases it is considering could nullify action by the Rhode Island legislature. All said that passage of either Rhode Island bill would not be affected by a Supreme Court ruling. That's because neither bill is proposing to make same-sex marriage illegal. The Supreme Court, in contrast, is weighing the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriages, said Jesse Choper, professor of public law at the University of California Berkeley School of Law. In the case heard March 26, the issue was whether a successful voter initiative passed in California, known as Proposition 8, can lawfully ban same-sex marriages in that state. In the case heard the next day, the issue was whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act, commonly called DOMA, is discriminatory because, like the California law, it restricts the definition of marriage to a union between one man and one woman. DOMA denies federal benefits to same-sex couples. "There is absolutely no chance that the Supreme Court will nullify a Rhode Island law adopting same-sex marriage, either by referendum or by action of the General Assembly," said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. "The issue in the two cases before the Supreme Court this term is whether laws against same-sex marriage violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, not whether laws allowing same-sex marriage violate the Constitution," he said in an e-mail. David S. Cohen, a constitutional law and gender issues expert at Drexel University in Philadelphia, agreed: "Rhode Island still has every reason to go forward if they want marriage equality," he said. If the Supreme Court were to broadly rule in the Proposition 8 case that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marry -- a ruling most of our experts said seems unlikely given comments made by the justices during oral arguments -- that "would legalize same-sex marriage in every state across the country no matter what the state is currently doing," Cohen said. A ruling on DOMA would only apply to federal law. Even if DOMA and the California proposition are upheld, "It doesn't preclude [Rhode Island] from recognizing same-sex marriage either way," said Emily Sack, also a professor at Roger Williams. In theory, if the Supreme Court were to require every state to accept same-sex marriage, that would make the proposed referendum on the Rhode Island Constitution a meaningless ballot question. "If the court rules that Prop 8 is invalid because same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in every state, the ruling would effectively block a state referendum on the subject because we don't put constitutional rights to a vote," said Goldstein. But "a decision granting same-sex marriage is under no threat of Supreme Court nullification, and the only realistic threat of nullification is if Rhode Island keeps the law as it is." Our ruling Bishop Thomas Tobin urged the General Assembly to delay consideration of any same-sex marriage legislation in Rhode Island because, "Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June." But the question of whether to allow same-sex marriage -- the topic of the bills being considered by the state legislature -- is not what the U.S. Supreme Court is considering. The court is looking at the constitutionality of laws intent on blocking same-sex marriage. That's a key difference. As a result, except for an unexpected decision by the court to allow same-sex marriage nationwide, approval of either General Assembly bill is not going to be affected by what the justices decide in June. We rule Tobin's statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-14842	Says a car driving former University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe "ran through the students, hit one of them" at the MU Homecoming Parade.	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2015/nov/18/juan-williams/fox-news-analyst-exaggerates-car-incident-homecomi/	Concerned Student 1950 has been thrust into the national spotlight after playing a role in ousting the leaders of MU and the University of Missouri System. The activist group, originally made up of 11 black students, drew attention to its cause with protests, a hunger strike by graduate student Jonathan Butler and a boycott by the football team. But before that, the group started by blocking the university's Homecoming Parade on Oct. 10, linking arms in front of the red convertible carrying then-UM System President Tim Wolfe and delaying the parade for about 10 minutes. Juan Williams evoked that incident during "The Five" on Fox News Channel, explaining why he thought it was best for Wolfe to resign. "What happened was the students at some point wanted his attention. They wanted the adult, the man in charge to talk to them, to deal with their dissatisfaction. Apparently a car ran through the students, hit one of them — and that's Butler, apparently." Did Wolfe's driver mow down the protesters? Not according to the police or video of the scene. Parade halt When Concerned Student 1950 blocked Wolfe's car, it did it at a bend in the parade route. The rest of the parade was eventually able to cut through a Domino's Pizza parking lot to circumvent the protesters, but each time Wolfe's driver tried to turn into the parking lot, the protesters rearranged themselves to block the car's path. (Although 11 students in matching shirts started the protest, some parade spectators joined them in the street and helped block the car.) It was during this constrained maneuvering that Wolfe's car made contact with Butler. How hard did it hit him? Neither Butler nor Concerned Student 1950 responded to a request for comment. But he wasn't hospitalized, according to police. Demonstrators' video of the parade shows that Butler remained standing and continued protesting. And video from the Columbia Missourian shows that he continued blocking Wolfe's car until police cleared the street. MU Police Major Brian Weimer told PolitiFact Missouri it was "incidental contact." People at the parade also described the contact between Butler and the car as accidental, though they said the driver seemed impatient and was revving his engine. Butler did file an incident report with MUPD, and Weimer said police "looked at all the video we could find" before closing the case and declining to arrest or cite the driver. "It was nothing intentional," Weimer said, adding that sometimes cars move a little bit when switching gears, which the driver was doing to try to get around the protesters. The car "wasn't trying to drive over them," he said. Even if the incident didn't affect Butler's physical well-being, it did emerge as a subplot in the protests that eventually removed Wolfe and then-MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. After the Homecoming Parade, Concerned Student 1950 sent a letter and a list of demands to Wolfe. The page-long letter doesn't mention the car contact. But the first demand included it among the grievances for which they wanted an apology: "We want Tim Wolfe to admit his gross negligence, allowing his driver to hit one of the demonstrators, consenting to the physical violence of bystanders, and lastly refusing to intervene when Columbia Police Department used excessive force with demonstrators." And in the days after the parade, Butler routinely cited it on Twitter. Some media outlets, such as Breitbart, have claimed Butler walked into the path of Wolfe's car and made contact with it himself. That website edited the video to show the sequence in slow motion while a narrator asserts that Butler walked into the car. It's clear that Butler was approaching the car before the contact took place, but it's inconclusive on whether Butler was moving or stationary when the contact occurred. It is clear, though, that the collision was minor. Williams didn't respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Williams said a car driving Wolfe "ran through the students, hit one of them." This is an exaggeration of what happened. A group of protesters blocked the path of Wolfe's vehicle during the Oct. 10 Missouri homecoming parade. At some point, Wolfe's vehicle made contact with Butler — but the incident didn't require Butler to receive medical attention, or even stop protesting. Police reviewed the incident and described it as "incidental contact." Williams' statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Juan Williams	None	None	None	2015-11-18T09:53:07	2015-11-10	['University_of_Missouri_System']
pomt-12862	The Obama administration issued an "11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/01/joni-ernst/joni-ernst-target-describing-11th-hour-obama-rule-/	At this year’s March for Life -- the annual anti-abortion rally in Washington -- Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, decried a federal rule implemented in the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration. Ernst told the crowd on Jan. 27, 2017, that she would "introduce a bill Monday to stop what some have referred to as ‘President Obama’s last gift to Planned Parenthood.’ " Ernst referred to Title X of the United States Public Health Service Act, which covers family planning. She said that her effort, in cooperation with Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn., "would scrap the Obama administration’s 11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood." We wondered if Ernst had accurately described the Obama administration’s action. Our conclusion: Ernst was essentially on target. About Title X Title X, as the federal rule notes, is the only federal program focused solely on providing family planning and related preventive services. In 2015, the rule says, more than 4 million individuals received services through more than 3,900 Title X-funded health centers. Planned Parenthood says its affiliates served approximately 1.5 million patients that year under Title X, about one-third of the federal program’s yearly total. Planned Parenthood has drawn criticism from anti-abortion advocates because in addition to providing uncontroversial women’s health services, the group also performs abortions. By law, abortions performed by Planned Parenthood are paid for by private money, not federal dollars. But anti-abortion advocates argue that money is fungible and that the federal government is effectively supporting a major provider of abortions. Supporters of Planned Parenthood counter that the money flows are separated and that barring federal dollars from being spent on Planned Parenthood would have dire negative consequences for women’s health, especially among poor Americans. The Obama administration rule On Sept. 7, 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a "notice of proposed rulemaking" -- the first step in formulating a new federal rule. The proposed rule would make clear that the decision to fund an organization under Title X cannot be based on "reasons other than its ability to provide Title X services." The effect would be that the fact of providing abortion services couldn’t be used against a group that seeks Title X funding. After the notice of proposed rulemaking was issued, the rule went through a series of required steps, including a public comment period. Ultimately, HHS acted to finalize the rule while the Obama administration was still in charge, but after Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election. HHS made the rule effective Jan. 18. Though the proposal was framed broadly, it was widely perceived as having a significant impact on Planned Parenthood. Both sides essentially agreed on that. After the notice of proposed rulemaking, Ernst and other lawmakers immediately expressed concern to HHS about its impact on Planned Parenthood. And after the rule was finalized, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement that "President Obama has cemented his legacy as a champion for women's health. This rule protects birth control, cancer screenings, (sexually-transmitted infection) testing and treatment and other health care for millions of people." Evaluating Ernst’s description So how well does Ernst’s characterization stack up? We’ll take her statement phrase by phrase. • "11th-hour rule." While all relevant procedures were followed in the formulation of the rule, the final rule did materialize quicker than many federal rules do, experts said. "The rule was proposed in September and finalized in December," said Columbia Law School professor Gillian Metzger. "In practice, that's a pretty fast turnaround." And of course, by making the effective date Jan. 18, 2017, it took effect in the final 48 hours of the Obama administration. All told, Ernst has a strong case for calling it an "11th-hour" rule. • "Entrenches federal family planning funding." Experts told PolitiFact that the Obama rulemaking did make the policy harder to overturn, although either Congress or Trump’s HHS department could take steps to do so. "I would not quibble about the use of ‘entrench’ in this context," said Boston University law professor Gary S. Lawson. "Rules are not that easy to change. There are degrees of entrenchment, of course, depending on the procedures required for change, but if someone wants to apply the term to a substantive agency rule, I would let them do it." Metzger agreed. "As a practical matter, reversing a rule takes resources and time by the agency, and there would likely be a court challenge and the possibility that a court would repeal the reversal as arbitrary." • "For Planned Parenthood." As we noted earlier, both sides in the abortion debate publicly linked the rule to Planned Parenthood. That said, the rule did not exclusively target Planned Parenthood. The rule itself does not mention the organization by name, although the accompanying material does mention the group specifically in a question-and-answer section summarizing public comments. "While Planned Parenthood might be one of the affected applicants, the rule is actually written in a neutral manner," said Jeffrey S. Lubbers, an American University law professor. Our ruling Ernst said the Obama administration issued an "11th-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood." It may be a slight exaggeration to use the word "entrench," since there are ways to overturn the rule within a matter of months, and it should be noted that the rule would affect a variety of other health care providers, not just Planned Parenthood, Still, it’s hard to argue that this was not an 11th-hour rule, and in general we find that Ernst has characterized pretty accurately what the Obama administration did.

"A lot of you know that the Republicans gerrymandered my district in 2012 so they can get a supermajority in the Senate," former state lawmaker Doug Stoner, a candidate for the chairmanship, said during a recent forum. "It’s a district that 64 percent of the folks voted for John McCain (in the 2008 presidential election). The point of all of this is I didn’t give up. I continued to work and I fought hard for that seat. I only lost by four points. I raised over $700,000. I have a real plan to … fund, build and engage this party." A PolitiFact Georgia reader did some checking and questioned Stoner’s claim that he raised $700,000 in his last campaign. Fundraising has been a problem for the party. The prior chairman, Mike Berlon, resigned in May, in part, because the party’s pockets were empty in comparison with their Republican counterparts. In April, the Democrats had $30,000 in cash while Republicans had 20 times as much money, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Stoner believes he can do a better job raising money for the party as party chairman. He’s one of three candidates vying for the position and the AJC has reported he has the backing of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and Mary Squires, who had been in the race. The election is scheduled for Saturday. About 300 people -- mostly state committee members -- are eligible to vote, said Liz Flowers, a party spokeswoman. Stoner spent two years in the Georgia House of Representatives before he was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2004. The Cobb County native served eight years in the Senate before losing to Republican Hunter Hill in November. The Republican-led Georgia Legislature reshaped the district’s boundary lines before the 2012 election, which Stoner still says made it easier for Hill to win. The district includes Sandy Springs, Smyrna and Vinings. "Doug Stoner stood up to Republican voting map gerrymandering and ran a tough campaign in a seat created for a GOP win," he says on his website. "Doug came within four points of winning the seat, raising upwards of $700,000." PolitiFact found information that seemed to contradict Stoner’s claim. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column reported in late October that Stoner’s Republican opponent "has raised $411,012 -- nearly double the amount of the Democratic incumbent." Stoner reported raising $273,513 for that race, according to paperwork filed with the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission. The commission was formerly known as the state Ethics Commission. Stoner explained the discrepancy. "Three hundred thousand (dollars) is about right for my 2012 race, but $700,000 is what I’ve raised for all my races," he said. Stoner directed us to Influence Exporter, a website that counts campaign contributions and who gives the politicians money. The website found Stoner raised $233,394 for his 2012 race and $708,657 for all his campaigns. As for the similar claim on his website, Stoner said it should say he raised a cumulative total of about $700,000 through all his races. Monday afternoon, Stoner told PolitiFact that he would have his staff post the correct information. It hadn’t been changed by Tuesday afternoon. To sum up, Stoner said he had raised about $700,000 in his 2012 campaign for a state Senate seat. Stoner said he meant $700,000 over the course of all his political campaigns. But the statements he made at the candidate forum and on his website leave a vastly different impression. We rate Stoner’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-05679	"There are a lot of casinos across the country that have gone bankrupt."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/15/robert-jacquard/rhode-island-state-rep-robert-b-jacquard-says-many/	It appears likely that come November Rhode Islanders will decide whether to expand the state’s two slot parlors into full-fledged casinos. State legislators have already approved holding a referendum on a proposal to allow table games at Twin River, in Lincoln, and are considering doing the same for Newport Grand. On March 6, before the House passed legislation to put the Newport Grand question on the ballot, Rep. Robert Jacquard raised concerns about allowing casinos in Rhode Island. "Let's face it: there are a lot of casinos across the country that have gone bankrupt," the Cranston Democrat said. "Just because you give them a casino license is not a guarantee that you are going to save all this money for the state and guarantee all this revenue. It is just not true at all. Management is the most important factor." But doesn’t the house always win? Have a lot of casinos around the country really gone bankrupt? We called Jacquard, who explained that he’s not necessarily opposed to casinos in Rhode Island, but he does want to make sure that if the state opts to go down that route, responsible operators with a lot of experience in the industry are brought in. He told us that he’s read about a number of casinos failing around the country, and although he hasn’t kept a list, he recalls bankruptcies occurring particularly in the South. "I know what I read in the paper," Jacquard said. We couldn’t find a central repository of information on casino bankruptcies, but we did come across numerous news reports about casinos and their financial struggles. Donald Trump has filed four corporate bankruptcies -- in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009 -- in connection to his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J. Tropicana Entertainment, which operates casinos in Nevada, New Jersey, Louisiana, Mississippi and Indiana, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008 and 2009. Station Casinos, which owns or operates 18 casinos in and around Las Vegas, made a similar filing in 2009. And on a side note, Rhode Islanders will be familiar with the struggles of Twin River, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 and emerged under new ownership the following year. It’s not technically a casino, but it is a local reminder of the potential pitfalls of the gambling industry. I. Nelson Rose, distinguished senior professor of law at Whittier Law School, in Costa Mesa, Calif., who writes about gambling and legal issues, has kept a partial list of gambling companies that have closed or filed for bankruptcy protection in the last three years as the recession has dragged on. He has counted 18 companies so far. Rose said that other casino operators, including MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Foxwoods, may not be facing bankruptcy but have struggled because of mounting debts and falling revenues. David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said gambling revenues in all major U.S. markets have declined since 2007 as discretionary spending has dried up. He also pointed to heightened competition in the gambling industry as another factor that’s squeezing casinos. For example, Atlantic City has lost business to newer casinos in Pennsylvania, whose residents can now gamble closer to home instead of making the trip to New Jersey. It’s in that sort of competitive market when management can be particularly important. Rose referred to Colorado’s experience in the early 1990s when 68 casinos opened in two or three years. A third of them eventually went bankrupt, and, said Rose, it turned out that the operators of those failed casinos had no previous experience in the industry. Our ruling Gambling is a boom or bust industry. Even when times are good, casinos fail. And when times are bad, even more fail. As Schwartz told us, casinos "definitely are not a sure thing." Good management matters -- a point Jacquard made as well. We rate Jacquard’s statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-05067	Voter fraud provided "a portion" of the margin of victory of Democrat John Lehman over Republican Sen. Van Wanggaard in a state Senate recall election.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/06/robin-vos/wisconsin-rep-robin-vos-says-voter-fraud-accounted/	The balance of power in the state Senate is poised to flip from Republicans to Democrats after voters in the 21st Senate District chose Democrat John Lehman over first-term Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine. Lehman’s margin of victory -- 819 votes out of 71,897 cast -- was confirmed July 2, 2012 after a recount. Lehman’s victory gives Senate Democrats a 17-16 seat majority -- at least until the November elections. In the days following the vote, Republican leaders noted that Wangaard received 49.4 percent of the votes cast in the Senate district, while Republican Gov. Scott Walker racked up 51.04 percent. (The results showed that Wanggaard received 2,689 fewer votes than Walker, while Lehman got 310 fewer votes than Barrett suggesting that Democrats were more prone to vote for their party’s Senate candidate than the Republicans in that election.) The Wanggaard campaign is considering a court challenge based on issues found during the recount. The problems identified included a variety of complaints from poll workers and election materials that were found in a garbage bin. The idea that the election results were tainted was advanced most aggressively by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, whose Assembly district is part of the 21st Senate District. He offered his views June 17, 2012 on WISN-TV (Channel 12) "Upfront with Mike Gousha." "Unfortunately, a portion of (the vote) was fraud," Vos said, adding "I’m not sure the entire 800 vote margin was..." Gousha interrupted and asked Vos if he could make the statement about fraud "with certainty." "I can, a portion," Vos said. "Yeah, I do believe that." When we asked Vos to back up his claim, he noted that the Racine County Sheriff’s Department is investigating two election-related issues -- election registration documents found in a dumpster, and complaints by a poll worker at one polling place. And he said he heard second hand that someone tried to use a Bed Bath and Beyond mailer as proof of address. "Is that fraud? I don’t know. It isn’t right and it seems fraudulent," he said. "You tell me how that’s not a fraudulent vote." "I did not personally witness any voter fraud," Vos said. "But some portion of what happened could be classified as fraud." We’re on thin ice already. He told us that there "could" be fraud involved in the vote. Yet Vos told Gousha and "Upfront" viewers that he could say with "certainty" that there was voter fraud. He offers no specific examples, other than the fact that the sheriff’s department is looking into election-related complaints. "We’re looking at a whole bunch of reports," Sheriff’s Department Lt. Steve Sikora told us. "It’s not voter fraud, it’s irregularities." Sikora said that once the reports were completed, the department would turn its findings over to the Racine County clerk and the district attorney’s office, since there has been so much public interest in it. As of July 3, 2012, no case has been turned over for prosecution of voter fraud. Because it was expected to be a tight race, the election was monitored by a large number of poll watchers from both political parties. And there have been claims of problems from both sides. Democrats and Racine Mayor John Dickert have complained that Republican poll-watchers broke the rules and intimidated voters. Meanwhile, the Mount Pleasant Patch.com site and the Racine Journal Times have reported that there were problems with voters who registered on the day of the election allegedly not signing poll books. However, the Journal Times reported June 26, 2012, that the book signing issue was considered an administrative mistake by the state Government Accountability Board and that the votes would be counted. GAB spokesman Reid Magney said that it was up to local law enforcement to determine if there were any violations of state election law. Regardless, none of these incidents -- at least so far -- appears to fall into the category of voter fraud. And certainly there has been no evidence that voting irregularities were significant enough to tilt the balance in Lehman’s favor. Conservative blogger Christian Schneider noted this in a June 26, 2012, post on his blog The Yankee Review, published on JSOnline.com. "The fact that new registrants were not required to sign log books isn't in itself proof of vote fraud. If one were dedicated enough to get on a bus and head down to cast a fraudulent vote, presumably they wouldn't have a problem scratching out an illegible signature on a log book." Even Wanggaard, in a July 2, 2012, statement issued after the recall was completed, stopped short of declaring that it was fraud: "Anyone who argues that this recount was a waste of time, or that we do not need voter ID, either wants to conceal these potential fraudulent activities or hasn’t been paying attention." Wanggaard campaign counsel Jonathan Strasburg went a bit further, saying the recount revealed that election officials "used procedures that would make Fidel Castro blush." In the run-up to the June 5, 2012, recall, we examined a statement from Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said that because of voter fraud, GOP candidates "need to do a point or two better" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin. Although past reports have found flaws, including cases of fraudulent voting in the city of Milwaukee, Priebus didn’t provide any information to support the specifics of his claim or the percentages cited. That’s one of our principles: It’s incumbent upon those making claims to be able to support them. We rated Priebus’ claim False. Our rating Vos said voter fraud provided "a portion" of the difference in Wanggaard’s loss in a critical state Senate recall election. The Racine County Sheriff’s Department is investigating issues regarding election procedures and paperwork, but a top official told us they do not suspect fraud. What’s more, Vos acknowledges he has no direct evidence of fraud. Yet he said with "certainty" that there was fraud. Based on the information publicly available now, we rate his claim False.

pomt-05155	Tim Kaine urged "$500 billion in Medicare cuts."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/20/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-says-tim-kaine-urged-500-billi/	American Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group, has a new TV ad attacking Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine that airs an old, discredited charge. The 30-second commercial says Kaine "left Virginia behind" during the final full year of his governorship in 2009 when, at President Barack Obama’s request, he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee. With footage of a suitcase being zipped and a passenger jet in the sky, the announcer says, "Kaine put partisan ambitions first, selling policies he knows hurt Virginia: Medicare spending cuts..." A silhouette appears of a person in a wheelchair. White and yellow capital letters letters read: "TIM KAINE $500 BILLION IN MEDICARE CUTS." Did Kaine, as DNC chairman, really promote $500 billion in Medicare reductions? PolitiFact is familiar with the $500 billion claim because it has come up over the last two years as a Republican talking point in a number of competitive races across the country. It all relates to Medicare reforms that were included in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Medicare covers health insurance costs for 39 million seniors and 8 million people under 65 receiving Social Security who are disabled. It makes up about 12 percent of the federal budget. During the last decade, the federal cost of Medicare increased by an average 8.1 percent a year. One of the goals of health care reform is to slow that growth. We asked American Crossroads -- a political action committee affiliated with Karl Rove, the senior political adviser to former President George W. Bush -- for evidence that Medicare has been cut by $500 billion. It referred us to three items written during the week Congress approved the health care law in March 2010. Two of them were news stories saying the legislation would "cut" the program by that amount. The third piece was a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the costs and savings in the healthcare bill. The nonpartisan agency said the law would reduce the projected 10-year cost of Medicare by $455 billion. But it did not say savings would come from "cuts" in services. Instead, the CBO explained that "Medicare spending would increase significantly more slowly during the next two decades than it has increased during the past two decades." The estimate became the basis for a tutorial by The Kaiser Family Foundation on how the health care reforms affect Medicare. The presentation was conducted by Tricia Neuman, a Kaiser vice president and director of the non-profit’s Medicare Policy Project. Some changes in the law increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage, Neuman said. For instance, the health care law adds $5 billion to help cover prevention services and $43 billion to help fill in a gap -- or "doughnut hole" -- for buying prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. Other changes will slow the growth in Medicare spending by more than $500 billion over 10 years, according to Kaiser’s tutorial. The largest savings, about $219 billion, will come from reducing the increases in reimbursements that medical providers receive each year. Another $136 billion will come from reductions in beneficiary payments for those enrolled in optional, private Medicare Advantage plans. Also, premiums will become more expensive for affluent Medicare beneficiaries. Those with high-cost "Cadillac" health insurance plans will begin paying a 40 percent excise tax on their premiums in 2018. The CBO, in a new estimate in March 2011, said the health care law would reduce the projected cost of Medicare by $564 billion from 2012 through 2021. But again, here’s the key fact: the health care law, according to Kaiser, does not cut $500 billion from current Medicare spending. Rather, the law will slow the program's future growth. Medicare spending will still increase. The CBO projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Most people, according to Kaiser, will not see their Medicare benefits reduced. Now, let’s turn back to Kaine. As DNC chairman, Kaine was a steadfast supporter of Obama’s policies, including the health care law. When the legislation passed the U.S. Senate, Kaine said, "We are now on the verge of the biggest domestic policy breakthrough since the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s." Our ruling American Crossroads says Kaine promoted a $500 billion cut to Medicare. The Affordable Care Act contains about $564 billion in cost-savings measures for Medicare over 10 years. But the definition of a cut means there would be a reduction in spending. That’s not the case here. Medicare spending will continue to expand. The law will slow the projected rate of growth. Kaine did advocate for the health care reform legislation, but he never called for a $500 billion cut to Medicare. We rate American Crossroad’s statement False.

pomt-01662	When news broke that Ferguson 18-year-old Michael Brown was a suspect in a robbery, "MSNBC practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/20/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-msnbc-went-air-after-news-michael-brown-w/	Knowledge of Michael Brown’s alleged involvement in a convenience store robbery before he was killed by police changed the entire narrative of Ferguson, Mo., but the "drive-by-media" couldn’t handle it, according to Rush Limbaugh. On Aug. 15, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released the name of the officer who shot Brown, six-year force veteran Darren Wilson, as well as a video allegedly showing Brown stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store minutes before he was shot. These details reveal the media-spun racial profiling tragedy as a simple episode of cops and robbers, Limbaugh said on his show on the same day. And in typical drive-by-media fashion, he said, reporters rushed to spread lies when the news broke and were just as quick to exit when the facts emerged. "MSNBC went to paid programming while they had editorial conferences to figure out how to deal with this!" Limbaugh said, and emphasized the point later in his program. "MSNBC, like I said, practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation." We wondered did MSNBC interrupt their programming for an extended commercial break after the details of Brown’s theft were released? Pressing matters We should note that the timeline of the revelations is fragmented. Information was released incrementally during three press conferences on Aug. 15. In the first press conference, which lasted from 9:43 to 9:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Ferguson police chief Jackson revealed Wilson’s name, gave a timeline of the events surrounding the shooting and robbery and announced he would take no questions. Members of the media received documents on the case and still images from surveillance footage of the robbery in press packets. The police report said that "Brown is the primary suspect in the robbery," and Jackson’s comments seemed to suggest that the encounter between Brown and Wilson was related to the robbery. Later that afternoon, the entire video of the robbery was released, around the time of a separate press conference held by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Johnson expressed his frustration at the Ferguson police’s handling of the case. That press conference lasted from 12:09 p.m to 12:45 p.m. Eastern. As for the surveillance video Jackson alluded to in his morning briefing, the exact timing of the full footage release is unclear, with dissonance between the three major cable networks. To the best of our knowledge, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was one of the first -- if not, the first -- news outlet to air the video at noon Eastern. MSNBC led with the footage minutes later on Andrea Mitchell, after the show began at noon. Fox News aired it 40 minutes later. On CNN’s Wolf, reporter Don Lemon said at 1:13 p.m. that the network still didn’t have the tape in its hands. By 1:25 p.m., host Wolf Blitzer said CNN had the tape but is "vetting it before we put it on air." In a later press conference from 3:05 p.m. to 3:14 p.m., Jackson clarified that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery case when he stopped the 18-year-old. Jackson also said that the matter is under investigation and that he released the documents because of Freedom of Information requests. Timeline of coverage Using a software called Critical Mention, we found when the three major cable news networks released the materials related to Brown’s death and robbery and when they went to commercial break on Aug.15. Here’s a timeline (all times Eastern): MSNBC CNN Fox News The Daily Rundown 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:57 a.m.: Program ends, commercial break José Díaz-Balart 10:42 a.m: Still images from surveillance tape shown 10:47 a.m.: Commercial break Andrea Mitchell Reports 12:03 p.m.: Full video shown 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol and Governor press conference 12:57 p.m.: Program ends, commercial break The Cycle 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:27 p.m.: Commercial break CNN Newsroom 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:52 a.m.: Commercial break 10:07 a.m.: Still images of surveillance tape shown 10:17 a.m.: Commercial break Legal View 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol and Governor press conference No commercial break Wolf 1:43 p.m.: Full video shown 1:47 p.m.: Commercial break CNN Newsroom 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:19 p.m.: Commercial break America’s Newsroom 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:51 a.m.: Commercial break 10:10 a.m.: Still images of surveillance tape shown 10:14 a.m.: Commercial break Outnumbered 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol and Governor press conference 12:43 p.m. Full video shown 12:48 p.m.: Commercial break Shepard Smith Reporting 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:14 p.m.: Press conference ends, commercial break As you can see, MSNBC was actually the first of the three cable networks to show the full video of Brown in the convenience store. It also aired all three press conferences that day, and for longer than either CNN or Fox News. There were no longer-than-usual commercial breaks and certainly no extended commercials or infomercials as Limbaugh's comments suggest. In fact, MSNBC was on air for 54 straight minutes after first airing the surveillance video. The ruling Limbaugh said, "MSNBC practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation," rolling paid advertising in lieu of programming. The release of information by the Ferguson police in the morning left Brown’s ties to the robbery unclear. Still MSNBC did not go to commercial break immediately. Nor did it go to break after showing frames from the video police alluded to. And certainly MSNBC never aired an extended commerical or infomercial as Limbaugh's statements suggest. Though when exactly the entire surveillance video was released is hard to say, MSNBC was one of the first news outlets to air it. After, MSNBC did not go to commercial break and had pundits discuss the video on air until a live press conference began. We rate Limbaugh’s claim False.

pomt-10133	John McCain accused Barack Obama "of letting infants die."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/barack-obama/obama-ad-wrong-about-mccain-abortion-charge/	Barack Obama recently released an attack ad on John McCain after Obama's abortion votes in the Illinois state legislature came under attack. The ad says that McCain accused Obama of "letting infants die." But we do not find that to be the case. Our story begins with an ad from an independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, that exists to criticize Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois. The group's ad shows a young woman, Gianna Jessen, looking directly at the camera and saying the following: "Can you imagine not giving babies their basic human rights, no matter how they entered our world? My name's Gianna Jessen, born 31 years ago after a failed abortion. But if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here. Four times Barack Obama voted to oppose a law to protect babies left to die after failed abortions. Senator Obama, please support born alive infant protections. I'm living proof these babies have a right to live." View the ad here . The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001, 2002 and 2003 by opponents of abortion. The intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Obama voted against the legislation several times. For more on the complicated history of this legislation read our story here. The Obama campaign has been trying to make inroads with voters who oppose abortion. Though Obama supports the right to abortion, he said he believes the number of abortions performed can and should be reduced. So the campaign released a vigorous response ad to the BornAliveTruth.org ad. But instead of targeting BornAliveTruth.org or Gianna Jessen, the ad attacks McCain . "John McCain's attacks, the sleaziest ads ever. Truly vile. Now, votes taken out of context accusing Obama of letting infants die. It's a despicable lie. Even the bill's Republican sponsor said that it's untrue. Obama's always supported medical care to protect infants. McCain. He's running on a platform to ban abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Sleazy ads. Anti-choice. That's John McCain." There are a few problems here. Obama's ad shows footage of the BornAliveTruth.org ad, which the McCain campaign did not produce. So the Obama ad is blaming McCain for an attack he didn't make. The first ad clearly states that BornAliveTruth.org created it, as is required by law. Also, though the Republican Party platform does call for a ban on abortion, McCain himself favors exceptions for rape and incest. (His running mate Sarah Palin has said she opposes those exceptions, but the ad doesn't mention her.) We looked for examples, but could find no cases of McCain accusing Obama of "letting infants die." Certainly some antiabortion activists who support McCain have made the charge, but that's quite different from the McCain campaign saying it. McCain's abortion-related attacks usually center on Obama's refusal to confirm conservative judges. We find the claim that McCain made the accusation to be False.

pomt-14484	"When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights … Blake Rocap stopped them."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/26/blake-rocap/claim-stopping-republicans-abortion-overlooks-Repu/	A Democratic aspirant for the Texas House seat to be relinquished by Elliott Naishtat of Austin presents himself as so much of a legislative pro, he stopped extremists from taking abortion rights. A Blake Rocap mailer presents this message: "When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights … Blake Rocap stopped them." On the flip side, the mailer says Rocap has 10 years of experience protecting abortion rights with key groups and "stood up to Republicans… and won," even proving the architect of state Sen. Wendy Davis’s 2013 filibuster ending a legislative session without abortion legislation advancing into law. Let’s be clear: Texas hasn’t outlawed abortion, which would surely run afoul of the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that established a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. But Texas Republicans have made an abortion harder to get. From 2009 through 2013, measures passed into law barring state aid to Planned Parenthood programs connected to abortion providers; requiring physicians to take sonograms before abortions; barring third-trimester abortions; requiring physicians who provide abortions to have admission privileges at nearby hospitals; and mandating clinics that provide abortions to meet hospital-like surgical standards; that law awaits Supreme Court review. Also, the "pro-choice" filibuster by Davis in 2013 was arguably nulled after the Republican governor, Rick Perry, called another session during which the Republican majority passed the Davis-opposed restrictions into law. Rocap’s backup So we asked Rocap, an Austin lawyer, about the basis of his claim to have stopped Republicans. By phone and email, he said he was referring to his work since 2009 as an advocate and strategist, first for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and later for the ACLU of Texas. Each group, Rocap said, hired him to stop such legislation -- and he did. Rocap said: -- In 2011, House Bill 2555 "would have drastically changed the process for minors to access an abortion and removed the option of a judicial bypass. As a volunteer attorney who represents abused teens I had intimate knowledge of the real-life situations that some teens encounter. I also am an expert in the statutory provisions and their history and was able to educate the members and their staff how the current law came to be, the several different provisions which would have remained un-amended in the bill that presented a constitutional problem and the real world problem for teens in Texas. The bill was not voted out of committee and was stopped." Legislative records show HB 2555 didn’t advance. The witness list for an April 2011 hearing on the proposal lists Rocap, for NARAL, as the person testifying against approval. Then again, Joe Pojman of the Texas Alliance for Life, an anti-abortion group, was among individuals registering in opposition. By email, Pojman told us the alliance opposed a provision in the legislation repealing written parental consent for minors to receive abortions. Pojman opined: "I do not think Blake had any effect at all on killing that bill. At least I was not aware that he had any effect." --In 2013, Rocap said, HB 997 would have banned abortion from being covered by insurance policies. "I testified against the bill and had specific conversations with members who told me that my testimony was impressive and would likely keep the bill from passing. The bill did not pass. A bill attempting to ban abortion coverage in insurance has been filed every session since 2011. I have through various efforts tried to stop them as part of my work, none have passed." Legislative records show HB 997 cleared a House panel but didn’t make it to the full House. The witness list for a March 2013 hearing lists Rocap, for NARAL, among four people to testify against the proposal; two people registered in opposition. --In 2013, HB 2308 "would have imposed difficult reporting requirements on physicians and imposed penalties," Rocap said. "I testified against the bill and tried to work with the bill’s author to reach an acceptable compromise. When we could not reach a compromise, I alerted the committee members and chair and the bill was not voted out. Our coalition of pro-choice lobbyists assigned me to work on this bill, I did, and the bill was stopped." The proposal died in a House committee, records show. A witness list lists Rocap, for NARAL, as the sole person to testify against approval; 25 others registered in opposition. The proposal’s author, Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, told us in a statement emailed by his office that he blamed Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, for the measure not advancing. Cook didn’t respond to a request for an interview. Rocap stood by his characterization of what happened. Generally, Rocap told us, he "worked on stopping every abortion bill since 2009 (four regular legislative sessions and their special sessions)" or "approximately 130 bills or proposed constitutional amendments" from 2009 through 2013 by writing amendments and questions and points of order to help House Democrats slow and stop measures. Those stops included, Rocap said, Senate Bill 182, a 2009 proposal to require that a pregnant woman undergo an obstetric ultrasound before obtaining an abortion. The legislation cleared the Senate and a House panel, records show, but wasn’t voted on in the full House. But such a mandate passed into law in 2011. HB 15 held that in most cases a sonogram be performed on the pregnant woman at least 24 hours before the abortion. Rocap commented by email: "I think you’ll agree that this doesn’t mean the effort in 2009 did not stop the bill. If OU beats Texas this coming fall, it doesn’t mean Texas didn’t win last year. That success in 2009 meant greater access to abortion for Texans for the approximately two-year time period before the bill that passed in 2011 eventually went into effect." Rocap said that in 2011 he stopped HB 2828, offered as an effort to ensure "that the pregnant woman's choice to have or seek an abortion is not the result of coercion or force," by working within the rules of the agenda-setting House Calendars Committee so it didn’t reach the floor in time to pass. Legislative records show the proposal was sent to the panel April 19, 2011 and members placed it on the House calendar weeks later, on May 9, 2011. And in 2013, Rocap said, he made sure the Texas Senate lacked sufficient votes to advance any of four anti-abortion proposals ultimately killed, for that session, by the Davis filibuster. (Davis did not reply to our emailed inquiry about Rocap’s role.) Asked to elaborate on what he did, Rocap said: "Those bills needed 2/3rds of the Senate to agree to bring them up. Part of my work involved making sure these bills did not get the necessary votes to proceed, by pursuing a number of tactics and strategies, generally known as lobbying, including confidential conversations, which I and others believe directly contributed to the failure of the bills." He agreed the same proposals subsequently made it into law. "I don’t believe that just because we eventually lost on one set of bills, that means all other successes and efforts are not significant, or did not happen," Rocap wrote. By email, Rocap further noted a May 2013 House resolution stating he was stepping down as NARAL’s Texas legislative counsel, "drawing to a close five years of steadfast service in defense of the reproductive rights of Texas women." Other ‘pro-choice’ voices Rocap suggested we confirm his claim by contacting Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, plus a Democratic House member, Jessica Farrar of Houston, among authorities. To our inquiries, both described Rocap as pivotal to slowing Republican pushes for abortion restrictions. By email, Busby called Rocap’s claim factual, writing: "Blake was our legislative counsel over a number of sessions and his work behind the scenes was instrumental in stopping bad legislation from passing. He was probably the sole reason anti-choice bills that were introduced during the regular session in 2013 never moved, and that is just one example. He was instrumental in devising the strategy that made Sen. Davis' filibuster possible." We requested more detail from Busby, who noted by phone that lobbying entails meetings that aren’t public; there aren’t "minutes" to pass along, she said. Asked if Rocap singlehandedly stopped Republicans on abortion, Busby replied: "If you want to explain how lobbying works, if you want to give full context, obviously there are many factors. But he was an instrumental factor." By phone, Farrar, a House member since 1995, said that among Democrats who defend against Republican-sought abortion restrictions, Rocap was "essential" and "our go-to guy" for devising legislative strategy and developing bill-stopping points of order, lining up witnesses--and knowing who to call in state agencies. She said she even remembered calling him even when he lived overseas. We followed up with Rocap, who told us by email that he accompanied his wife to an assignment abroad from mid-2013 through 2015. In that time, he said, the ACLU of Texas still hired him as its legislative strategist on abortion rights and reproductive health. By email, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based group, Anna Núñez, confirmed the described hiring. Farrar said: "He just knows a lot about it," adding that it’s fair to say Rocap had stopped measures. "I don’t know that we could have gotten as far as we did on many of those issues if he wasn’t there." Farrar also acknowledged that Republicans had succeeded in passing abortion restrictions in recent years. "Every session," she said, "they file their whole litany of stuff and get something out of it." Other ‘pro-life’ voices By email, Pojman and Melissa Conway, of Texas Right to Life, which calls itself the largest "pro-life" group in Texas, each expressed skepticism about Rocap’s claim. Pojman said that since 2011, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas "has been spectacularly unsuccessful at stopping pro-life bills." He included a list of proposals passed into law. Conway separately said "moderate GOP leadership like" Cook "were the ones who stopped life-saving legislation from reaching the House floor where pro-life measures would have passed overwhelmingly." Conversely, Kyleen Wright, president of the Arlington-based Texans for Life Coalition, credited Cook with helping Republicans advance most of what advocates sought. She singled out changes including the sonogram law, the de-funding of clinics connected to Planned Parenthood and the toughened standards for abortion clinics approved in 2013. Rocap, she wrote, "was not successful in stopping any of this legislation." Rocap: Criticisms no surprise We shared such analyses with Rocap, who commented by email: "Anti-choice lobbyists attacking the successes of the pro-choice movement, despite our minority status in the legislature in Texas, is nothing new." He added that the criticism "speaks to my experience and effectiveness that extremists view me as a threat." Our ruling Rocap said in a voter mailer: "When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights… Blake Rocap stopped them." Rocap ranks among Texas "pro-choice" advocates who battled and sometimes derailed Republican moves pitched as reducing the prevalence of abortion. But Republicans also ultimately passed multiple restrictions into law; no one stopped that. We rate Rocap's incomplete statement Mostly False.

pomt-14174	"A simple review of the Backroom’s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations."	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/apr/26/shawn-oconnor/nh-democrat-says-popular-political-stop-infested-r/	In a case of Democrat backbiting, congressional candidate Shawn O’Connor says a popular New Hampshire restaurant, known for its chicken tenders and visits from presidential candidates, is full of rodents. It’s one of the latest accusations to fly in the Democratic race for the New Hampshire’s first congressional district. O’Connor is running in the primary against Carol Shea Porter, who has previously held the seat. Of late, both the state Democratic party and O’Connor have accused the other of making false claims. O’Connor put out a statement claiming a Democratic state senator told others that he -- O’Connor -- planned to place rats into the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom restaurant in Manchester. O’Connor denies the allegation. "Furthermore, a simple review of the Backroom’s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations," O’Connor, a businessman from Bedford, wrote in a widely circulated statement on Monday, April 25, 2016. Is there any truth to this claim? O’Connor’s spokesman Logan Barbosa pointed us to the Manchester Department of Health website, which posts city restaurant inspections. Barbosa said the Puritan Backroom has been cited for "critical item violation #35 (defined as found to have insects or rodents, or areas were identified that would allow the entry of rodents or insects)." There’s a big difference between having rodents, and having areas that would allow their entry. Let’s take a look. Under city ordinance, restaurants are inspected twice a year. A decade’s worth of inspection records for the Puritan Backroom, a sit-down restaurant that also has an ice-cream window, are available on the Manchester city website. In nine of the 18 inspections since 2006, including the four most recent, the restaurant has had "no critical violations observed," records show. The restaurant was most recently cited in 2013, but for food temperature issues. Over the last decade, records show the Puritan Backroom has never been cited for evidence of rodents on the premises or for any infestation. The restaurant was cited in 2011 and 2007 for an "outer openings" violation, which falls under the critical item violation #35. In 2011, inspectors noted the "facilities outer openings have not been tightly sealed to the outside to prevent the entry of pests." In 2007, inspectors recommended the restaurant install new weather stripping on the rear door, according to Phil Alexakos, Manchester’s Chief of Environmental Health, who oversees inspections. Neither situation meant the restaurant had pests, Alexakos said. "If these gaps aren’t repaired, it could introduce pests," he said. The city’s public health department hasn’t received any complaints about rodents at the facility, according to Alexakos. Officials have never noted the presence of rodents on site, inspection records show. Restaurant president Arthur Pappas -- who co-owns the Puritan Backroom with son Democratic Executive Councilor Chris Pappas -- disputes the claim. "It is absolutely untrue," Arthur Pappas said. "Anybody who has been in my kitchen knows there has never been a problem." Our ruling O’Connor said the Puritan Backroom restaurant has a "long-standing problem with rodent infestations." Inspection records from the last decade show officials have never noted rodents inside the restaurant. While more than five years ago inspectors noted gaps where pests could potentially enter the restaurant, none have been documented inside over the last ten years. That's a far cry from a long-standing infestation. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Shawn O'Connor	None	None	None	2016-04-26T20:17:36	2016-04-25	['None']
pomt-00102	"Cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/30/blog-posting/no-national-cancer-institute-does-not-named-mariju/	Canada didn’t pay off the country’s federal debt one day after marijuana legalization, but could cannabis wipe out disease? "Cancer institute finally admits marijuana kills cancer," trumpets the headline of an article that has been shared about 161,000 times on Facebook. The article goes on to say that in August 2015, the National Cancer Institute released a report on its website that stated "marijuana kills cancer." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was published on ehealthmagz.com but it’s unclear what the website is actually called. The website’s browser tab says "Health Magazine," but at the bottom of the page, an "about us" section describes the site as, simply, "Newspaper." "Newspaper is your news, entertainment, music fashion website," it says. "We provide you with the latest breaking news and videos straight from the entertainment industry." An email we sent to the contract address on the website—contact@yoursite.com—bounced back. Though the website credits the article to "Stoners Cookbook," the link leads to a broken web page. But, the story also links to a page about cannabis and cannabinoids on the website for the National Center Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. In an email, a spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute directed PolitiFact to the same web page about cannabis and cannabinoids. However, according to a statement from the institute, "this page is not a report or study." It’s a summary that has been on the institute’s website for about 13 years and that is maintained and updated "by an editorially independent board of private-sector and public-sector experts." The information in the summary reflects a review of biomedical literature, according to the statement; it doesn’t represent a policy statement from the institute or the National Institutes of Health. The cannabis page was updated in August 2015, like the story says, and in August 2018. But nowhere on the site does it say "marijuana kills cancer." Here’s some information it does include: Cannabinoids activate specific receptors throughout the body to produce pharmacologic effects. Some cannabinoids are approved drugs to treat cancer-related side effects, and they may have benefits in the treatment of cancer-related side effects. One study using rodents suggested that cannabinoids may ward against the development of certain types of tumors. In another study, "cannabinoids appear to kill tumor cells." "Other studies have shown the antitumor effect of cannabinoids… in preclinical models of breast cancer." However, "no ongoing clinical trials of cannabis as a treatment for cancer in humans were identified" in a search of studies, according a National Cancer Institute web page. So while cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in labs, and it may benefit the side effects of cancer treatments, like chemotherapies, it’s not an FDA-approved cancer treatment, there isn’t enough evidence for doctors to recommend it as a treatment for cancer-related symptoms and the National Cancer Institute has not admitted that marijuana kills cancer.

pomt-04988	The Obama administration "has been outsourcing" by sending money to "solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-stimulus-money-solar-and-energy-was-ou/	Faced with criticism that he sent American jobs overseas, Mitt Romney tried to turn the tables on President Barack Obama by calling him the "outsourcer-in-chief" and highlighting foreign spending from the economic stimulus. At a town hall meeting in Grand Junction, Colo., Romney said, "this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States." The Romney campaign backed up the claim by citing a report from the Investigative Reporting Workshop that found about 65 percent of the wind turbines on stimulus-funded projects came from foreign manufacturers. PolitiFact has examined a number of claims about stimulus dollars going overseas, especially in the area of alternative energy. We have found an element of truth to these statements but that generally the numbers are exaggerated. Critics of the stimulus have tallied government loans, grants and tax credits going to a foreign firm but they often ignore that most of the money goes to domestic subsidiaries, and most of the work takes place on U.S. soil. In this case, though, Romney is less specific -- and more accurate. Indeed, many foreign companies benefited from American tax credits and Energy Department grants, and those programs created some jobs in foreign countries. A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent of wind power spending goes overseas. Another federal study put the number at about 40 percent. That's because many components for wind turbines are not manufactured in the United States. In fact, it is extremely difficult to know exactly where everything is made. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import many parts. The Romney campaign cited the 65 percent figure from investigative reporter Russ Choma, but right after Choma gave that number he wrote, "I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas, and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here." For solar power, the dependence on foreign components could well be greater than for wind. The Earth Policy Institute reports that the U.S. produces only about 4 percent of the total world output of photovoltaic cells. According to a government study, many American manufacturers import most of their components for final assembly in the U.S. Overall, when the federal government supports the use of wind and solar power, it is virtually certain that some if not most of the materials will come from overseas. That is more true for solar than it is for wind. However, it is one thing for federal stimulus dollars to be spent overseas; it is another to label this as outsourcing. In many cases, the reason the products come from foreign makers is that no one makes them here. Choma wrote on his blog that his work has been taken out of context. "I found nobody wanted to talk about how battered our industry was from past mistakes," Choma wrote. "Maybe before we promise hundreds of thousands of jobs, we should deal with the fact there isn’t an industry to create those jobs in." Given the nuances of the industry -- and its recent growth in the U.S. -- it's important to examine the claims about outsourcing. The Republican National Committee put up a website on this theme called "Obamanomics Outsourced". As one example, the site claims that subsidiaries of the Danish wind turbine maker Vestas received tax credits worth nearly $52 million. What it didn’t say was that the subsidiaries, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers, are all based in Colorado. The tax credits, under a program called 48C, were created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aka the stimulus.The Vesta American operation got the tax credits in exchange for building manufacturing plants that would hire American workers. While Vesta recently announced layoffs, work continues at the plants. "I would call this the opposite of outsourcing," said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. "This is insourcing. It’s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S." The RNC website says the wind power industry overall lost 10,000 jobs after 2009, but Kelley notes most of those were in construction, which had peaked that year. He says those newly constructed wind facilities have led to a workforce of 75,000 wind-related jobs. Some are tied directly to running the wind farms, but about 30,000 are in manufacturing. "These are better than construction jobs," said Kelley, "because they pay good wages and they last longer." We found further evidence that the wind power industry is expanding. A 2011 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission notes that three foreign companies opened their first U.S. manufacturing plants in 2010. Internal Revenue Service data shows that all three of the firms received those energy tax credits under the federal stimulus. The trade commission analyst says the expansion of American production contributed to a decrease in imports of wind energy components and an increase in American exports. And the share of American-made parts is growing. The wind association estimates the value of the American-made content went from 25 percent in 2004 to over 60 percent in 2011. Still, foreign suppliers have remained the largest beneficiaries of the spending on wind power. Imports may have declined but at about $1.2 billion in 2010, they were still about ten times larger than exports. Domestic production of solar energy components have struggled more. According to the Congressional Research Service, these manufacturing plants "appear to have relatively short life spans." Eight plants closed in 2011 alone. It has been a goal of the Obama administration to expand domestic renewable energy manufacturing. Both the wind and solar industries depend enormously on federal policy. Wind, and to a lesser degree, solar, grew during the last decade thanks to the high price of oil and high demand, but especially thanks to the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit and other incentive. That credit expires this year and the industry predicts major job losses if that happens. Government policy dating back to 2005 spurred the growth of the alternative energy sector but the state of the industry in the United States remains precarious. Our Ruling Romney said, "This president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies, solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States." There is some truth to Romney's statement because stimulus dollars did go to foreign companies, largely because there was a shortage of American firms producing key components for generating wind and solar power. But given that situation, it is inaccurate to call it "outsourcing" because there is not a source domestically. Also, it's important to note that domestic manufacturing tied to wind power benefited considerably from the stimulus. Thanks to the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit, the domestic sector was growing before Obama took office and accelerated during his first three years. However, federal policy has been less effective in the area of solar power. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-06796	Says "of the 2,000 Portland households in the year-long (composting) pilot, 87 percent of participants reported being satisfied with the overall system."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/aug/14/sam-adams/portland-mayor-says-nearly-87-percent-food-scrap-p/	Fresh off winning a resolution to ban plastic bags in Portland grocery stores, Mayor Sam Adams is pitching another way to make the city ever greener: curbside composting. The mayor wants to rework the way the city collects its residents’ garbage. Under his proposal, Portlanders would get composting pails for their kitchens which they would empty into their yard debris roll carts. The debris and compost would be picked up every week while regular garbage pick-ups would drop to every other week. About 2,000 households have been doing this since May 2010 as part of a pilot program. The City Council is set to vote on the proposal in the next week or so with the goal of getting the whole city composting by the end of October. In selling this new idea to residents, the mayor and his staff have been citing all sorts of statistics, including this pretty persuasive one: "Of the 2,000 Portland households in the year-long pilot, 87 percent of participants reported being satisfied with the overall system." It didn’t take long before the stat found its way around the media. Not only does it appear at least twice on city websites, but it also made its way into reports over at OPB News and KGW News (8). The statistic also caught the eye of local blogger Victoria Taft, who questioned its veracity. We wanted in on the action, so we called the mayor’s office to check on the poll. An hour later, we had a copy in our inbox. A quick look at the first page of the poll seemed to bear out the mayor’s claim -- at least partially. According to the survey his office conducted, 63 percent were "very satisfied" with the program, while another 24 percent were "somewhat satisfied." Add those together and you have that 87 percent satisfaction rate. (The others were either "not satisfied" or "don’t know.") Those numbers are right. But we had two issues with the survey: the design and the sample. The design of the poll seemed to tilt the response toward the positive end. You only have three categories "very satisfied," "somewhat satisfied" and "not satisfied" and the mayor’s office lumps the first two together to mean "satisfied." Typically, however, there’s a bracket, said Stuart Elway, a pollster out of Seattle. "You can get into arguments about how many points there should be in a scale," Elway said. "Typically you would have a balanced number, so you'd have two positive and two negative." We know for certain from the mayor’s survey that 63 percent of the respondents were definitely satisfied. That second category, though, is squishy. Would those folks, if given the option, have cited mild dissatisfaction? No one can be certain. On to the sample. According to the report the mayor’s office sent us, the survey only covered 391 responses. That’s a difference from the claim in our ruling statement. The statement makes it sound as though all 2,000 pilot homes responded and that, of them, 87 percent liked the program. We asked the mayor’s office about this discrepancy. Dan Anderson, the mayor’s spokesman, told us that we were right -- only 20 percent responded. But, he said, the statements on the city’s website were still accurate. That 20 percent, he said, is statistically significant and could, mathematically speaking, represent the whole. "This isn’t Survey Monkey," he said referring to a website that allows users to make quick and dirty polls. "It’s sophisticated, it’s accurate, it’s demographically diverse. We’re confident that it’s representative of what those in the pilot program felt of the program." The website, he said, could be clearer, but was still accurate. He promised to update it. He also sent us some minutes from the August 10, 2011 City Council meeting in which Adams speaks about the survey. "The 20 percent in terms of return rate in a neighborhood of 2,000, we do -- we do polling, our recent polling by the city of Portland, actually polled a much smaller sample," Adams said. "So 20 percent is representative. We think, adequately representative in terms of statistical validity." But he’s not entirely right. Indeed, a 20 percent response rate to a mail survey is on the high end, said Elway. Still, when the respondents are self-selected, as they were here, it’s hard to tell whether they’re truly representative. "You really can't apply the laws of probability for a mail survey," Elway said. "But what you can do is say ‘Of the 20 percent that we got back, how well do they match the population?’ The more of those kinds of measures you have, the more confidence you can have that the results are valid. We asked the mayor’s office if they’d taken a look at whether the respondents reflected the larger group’s demographics, but they hadn’t collected many of the details. The mayor’s office made one other point during our discussion: Usually self-selecting respondents trend negative. If you really dislike something, you’re motivated to let people know. Elway said that is sometimes true, but that it’s probably not as much of an issue for a pilot group. If anything, he said, it’s possible the poll might be skewed positive. "It doesn’t sound like a totally bogus poll or anything," he said. But "if I were the client looking at this, I would look at the positive number I got back with squinty eyes. So where does all this leave us? Well, we’re not sold that the satisfaction rate is as high as 87 percent, given the survey design and the way the sample was collected. But, it does seem obvious that, among the pilot homes, the program is relatively popular. We’ll give this statement a Half True.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2011-08-14T15:56:20	2011-08-10	['None']
pomt-09061	On whether a U.S. Supreme Court nominee should be forthcoming at confirmation hearings.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/29/elena-kagan/elena-kagan-law-review-article-said-supreme-court/	We knew a flip flop might be coming after reading Elena Kagan's 1995 law review article on public hearings for nominees to the United States Supreme Court. Writing 15 years ago, Kagan wrote that the typical confirmation hearing was "a vapid and hollow charade." Too often, Kagan wrote, nominees were cagey and uncommunicative about their views, and senators seemed to accept that evasiveness with a shrug. "When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public," Kagan wrote. "Such hearings serve little educative function, except perhaps to reinforce lessons of cynicism that citizens often glean from government," she added. "Neither can such hearings contribute toward an evaluation of the Court and a determination whether the nominee would make it a better or worse institution. A process so empty may seem ever so tidy -- muted, polite, and restrained -- but all that good order comes at great cost." Kagan's article was a book review of The Confirmation Mess, by Stephen L. Carter. Carter's book dissected the Supreme Court nomination and hearings of Robert Bork, a legal scholar and judge nominated to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. After contentious hearings in which Democrats excoriated Bork's conservative views, the senate rejected his nomination on a 42-58 vote. In the review, Kagan writes that the Bork hearings may have been contentious, but the nominee's actual testimony was serious and substantive. "The Bork hearings presented to the public a serious discussion of the meaning of the Constitution, the role of the Court, and the views of the nominee; that discussion at once educated the public and allowed it to determine whether the nominee would move the Court in the proper direction," she wrote. Nominees shouldn't say how they would rule on a specific case, but "a nominee can say a great, great deal before making a statement that, under this standard, nears the improper. A nominee, as I have indicated before, usually can comment on judicial methodology, on prior case law, on hypothetical cases, on general issues like affirmative action or abortion." At the time Kagan wrote her review, she was a law professor at the University of Chicago, and had served a short stint as special counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, primarily to provide guidance on President Bill Clinton's nomination of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993. (The committee chair was then-Sen. Joe Biden.) Speaking at her own confirmation hearing, Kagan said some of that review wasn't quite right. "I do think much of what I wrote in 1995 was right, but in some measure I got a bit of the balance off," she said. What she got right back then, she said, was that it was inappropriate for a nominee to indicate how he or she might vote in a specific case. But now she realized that there are other types of questions about previous cases or judicial philosophy that could give hints to how a justice would vote in the future. "I skewed it too much toward saying that answering is appropriate even when it would, you know, provide some kind of hints," she added. "And I think that that was wrong. I think that, in particular, that it wouldn't be appropriate for me to talk about what I think about past cases -- you know, to grade cases -- because those cases themselves might again come before the court." We should note that senators from both parties asked Kagan about the book review and her thoughts on how candid nominees should be. Sen. Herb. Kohl, D-Wisc., noted that Kagan wrote it was a fair question to ask a nominee in what direction she would move the court. Kagan answered simply, "Well, it might be a fair question." Left unsaid was the possibility that she might not answer, a response that drew laughter from the audience. Kagan also declined to answer other questions during the course of the hearing, such as when Kohl also asked her to comment on the Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore, which pushed the disputed 2000 election to a conclusion. Kohl specifically noted that the case would not come before the court again, and asked her if the Supreme Court should have gotten involved in the case in the first place. Rather than saying plainly that she wouldn't answer, Kagan evaded the question by saying she thought the court might consider the type of question again. "And if it did, I would try to consider it in an appropriate way, reading the briefs and listening to the arguments and talking with my colleagues," she said. "I think it is an important question, and a difficult question, about how an election contest that at least, arguably, the political branches can't find a way to resolve themselves, what should happen, and whether and when the court should get involved. It's hard to think of a more important question in a democratic system, and maybe a tougher one." In ruling on this statement, we find that Kagan herself has walked back her previous position on how much Supreme Court nominees can and should comment during nomination hearings. She indicated she would not be answering questions that she had previously said were not only permissible but desirable. So we rate her position a Full Flop.

pomt-02148	"More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/04/kareem-abdul-jabbar/nba-legend-abdul-jabbar-more-whites-believe-ghosts/	The May 4 Sunday news shows sought outside-the-Beltway perspective for talking about American race relations, booking stars from the basketball and music industries to analyze racist comments made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Guests included Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am and former basketball stars Kevin Johnson (now the mayor of Sacramento, Calif.) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Abdul-Jabbar, who worked under Sterling for three months as a Los Angeles Clippers coach in 2000, offered his thoughts on the controversy last week in a Time op-ed, saying Sterling’s racially disparaging remarks revealed in a leaked voicemail were not a surprise given other discrimination over recent years. On the set of ABC’s This Week with host George Stephanopoulos, the retired six-time NBA champ said racism remains part of American culture. "This is a problem. I did a little bit of research. More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism," he said. "That’s why we have shows like Ghostbusters and don’t have shows like ‘Racistbusters.’ " We set out to find whether his catchy comment comparing white attitudes on ghosts and racism is accurate. We tried to contact Abdul-Jabbar through Twitter and ABC’s media team but could not reach him by our deadline. Polls on white Americans and ghosts A number of polls over the years have examined Americans’ belief in the supernatural, including ghosts. The problem is the surveys are often not broken down by race and the questions are not universally framed. People are generally more likely to say they believe in ghosts than that they have interacted with one. Non-white Americans are more likely than whites to say they believe in ghosts, and women are more likely to believe in paranormal activity than men, said Carson Mencken, a Baylor University sociology professor and director of the Baylor Religion Survey, a national random sample of U.S. households completed every three years with Gallup. According to the most recent survey results, in 2010, about 56 percent of whites say ghosts either absolutely or probably exist, which is "pretty consistent over time," said Mencken, who co-wrote Paranormal America: Ghost encounters, UFO sightings, Bigfoot hunts and other Curiosities in Religion and Culture. (Within that rate, 22 percent said they absolutely exist, he said.) That’s a bit higher than other surveys we found, but Baylor professors said results can skew widely depending on the way a question is framed. A Harris Poll of 2,250 people surveyed online in November 2013 found that 42 percent of all Americans, and 42 percent of whites, said they believe in ghosts. The overall average was down from 51 percent of all adults who said they believed in ghosts in a 2003 Harris Poll. That 11-year-old survey, which included response rates by race, showed 51 percent of whites as saying they believe in ghosts, compared with 43 percent of blacks and 59 percent of Hispanics. Another poll, by the Huffington Post and YouGov.com, found 45 percent of Americans say they "believe in ghosts, or that the spirits of dead people can come back in certain places." We were unable to find a breakdown of the December 2012 survey by race. Another September 2013 poll of 1,000 Americans by the Huffington Post and YouGov.com asked if they agreed with the statement "I believe some people have experienced ghosts." Sixty percent of whites agreed, compared with 62 percent of both black and Hispanic respondents. Showing just how much the way a question is worded can affect answers, a 2011 poll by The Economist/YouGov found 36 percent of white Americans say they generally believe in ghosts. The takeaway: The number of white Americans who say they believe in ghosts ranges from 36 percent to 62 percent depending on the year, survey and question. Polls on white Americans and racism We were unable to find a poll that asked Americans if they "believe" racism exists. Nor do pollsters ask, "Are you racist?" "People are obviously unlikely to tell pollsters they are racists," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "So I don't know how to interpret what he said." Still, we found many polls examining white Americans’ attitudes on race relations, with a lot of recent polling conducted amid the summer 2013 Trayvon Martin trial. Gallup has done a lot of work on this subject. Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport produced a July 2013 video analyzing highlights in polling research on U.S. race relations. These questions peel away American attitudes on race and show clear disconnects. When asked if new civil rights laws are needed to reduce discrimination against blacks, 53 percent of blacks said yes compared with 17 percent of whites. When asked if the justice system is biased or not, 68 percent of blacks and 25 percent of whites said yes, "a huge racial gulf there," Newport says. In yet another interesting Gallup question, 15 percent of whites said the fact that blacks have on average worse jobs, income and housing than whites was mostly due to discrimination, with 83 percent saying the cause was something else. One Gallup question that got at the issue a little more directly (but several years ago in 2009): "Do you think racism against blacks is or isn’t widespread in the U.S.?" Forty-nine percent of whites said it is widespread, while 48 percent said it was not widespread. We looked at other surveys, too, recognizing there are probably so many that we could not have reviewed them all by our deadline. A May 2013 poll for the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found 57 percent of whites said there was some or a lot of discrimination against blacks (88 percent of blacks said they saw a lot of or some discrimination against blacks). A 2006 CNN survey found 66 percent of whites say racism is a "very serious" or "somewhat serious" problem. Finally, a 2011 study by the Harvard Business School and Tufts University found white Americans feel they are more discriminated against than blacks. The "reverse racism" sentiment is notable, researchers said, "because by nearly any metric—from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education—statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for black than white Americans." The takeaway: The results, again, vary depending on the question — but none of them truly measure whether white Americans believe racism exists. In general, polls seem to suggest blacks are more likely to see racism as a problem than whites, but a plurality of whites acknowledge discrimination exists in some form in at least two polls we saw. But even these comparisons to Abdul-Jabbar’s claim are not perfect, as those polls measured whether discrimination was widespread or asked respondents to measure the amount of discrimination against blacks, not just acknowledge whether it was present. "The problem with the comparison is how do we measure racism? Racism takes a lot of forms. It’s much, much harder to say, ‘Do you believe in racism?’ than ‘Do you believe in ghosts?’ " said Kevin Dougherty, a Baylor University associate sociology professor. "As a rhetorical flourish, I think it’s an effective one," Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, said of Abdul-Jabbar’s statement. But a serious look at empirical data shows it is "far too complex to just be captured in one kind of rhetorical comparison." Our ruling Abdul-Jabbar said, "More whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism." While we don’t know what research he was citing to support his point, Abdul-Jabbar’s claim is a stretch based on the polls we found and the pollsters we consulted. Depending on the question, you could argue that as many as about 6 in 10 white Americans believe in ghosts, though other polls present a smaller ratio. Abdul-Jabbar, meanwhile, seems to have interpreted polling about white Americans’ views of discrimination as their belief in racism. We'll be happy to revisit this fact-check if someone points out a poll we missed. Polling we found supports the theory that white Americans are less likely than black Americans to think that blacks are being discriminated against. But those polls don’t measure whether white Americans think racism exists in this country. Experts told us that defining racism is difficult in terms of a poll and that a comparison with believing in ghosts is problematic. Abdul-Jabbar fails to acknowledge the wide disparity on polls dealing with ghosts, inaccurately describes the polling on racism and makes a shaky comparison between the two. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar	None	None	None	2014-05-04T17:04:50	2014-05-04	['None']
pomt-10573	John McCain "voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/citizens-united-political-victory-fund/mccain-voted-against-cuts-now-supports-them/	The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund launched an ad that at first appears to be an attack on Sen. Hillary Clinton, making several charges about votes and political positions. "One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times," the narrator states, among other charges. A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal Sen. John McCain; the narrator says, "Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain." "John McCain. Surprisingly liberal," the ad concludes. The ad is correct that McCain voted against tax cuts proposed by the Bush administration two times, in 2001 and 2003. McCain was on the losing end of those votes; the tax cuts passed. In 2006, McCain changed position and voted in favor of extending the tax cuts. McCain has explained his position by saying that although he opposed the cuts when first proposed because of budget issues, rescinding the tax cuts after they were in effect would be the equivalent of a tax increase. The ad gets it right that McCain voted against the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. But by using the word "both," it implies there were only two votes. It doesn't mention the 2006 vote when McCain changed position and voted in favor of a tax cut extension. (Clinton voted in favor of the 2006 tax cuts as well.) We have to deduct a little bit for leaving the impression that there were only two votes on the tax cuts, but the ad is correct that McCain voted against the measures. So we find the statement that McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts "both times" to be Mostly True.

pomt-02565	David Dewhurst is "the first lieutenant governor in history to have a personal security detail."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/31/todd-staples/david-dewhurst-appears-be-first-lieutenant-governo/	Todd Staples, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas, charged incumbent David Dewhurst, standing to his left, with a self-oriented achievement. At a Jan. 27, 2014, debate, hosted by KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas, Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, said: "I wish the lieutenant governor was more focused on what we’re spending in public schools rather than... being the first lieutenant governor in history to have a personal security detail. I would be more worried about what’s going on in the security of our schools rather than having a personal security detail that drives you from place to place and sweeps rooms before you go in." Is Dewhurst, the lieutenant governor since 2003, making history with a security phalanx? Law enforcement agency confirms To our inquiry, Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, confirmed that Dewhurst is the first lieutenant governor to have a state security detail. Asked if the detail is provided full time or on an as-needed basis, Vinger said the agency does not discuss security specifics. Generally, Vinger told us by email, the DPS "is committed to protecting any state official that may be under threat conditions, especially considering that the threat environment has changed dramatically over the last decade," Vinger said. "The Texas Government Code, Section 411.002(a) charges DPS with enforcing the laws protecting public safety and providing for the prevention and detection of crime. "This includes any threat or attempt to physically harm any state official," Vinger wrote. "The department deploys resources to detect and prevent such an act from occurring. Protecting the governor, lieutenant governor," Texas House "speaker, attorney general and other state officials is a critical mission of the department, and DPS has a responsibility to perform these and other security related missions, such as protecting the state Capitol." Dewhurst: 'I didn't request protection' Word of officials beyond Gov. Rick Perry getting greater security attention surfaced in early 2011, a year after a man fired shots on the south steps of the Texas Capitol before getting tackled by state troopers, according to a Jan. 21, 2010, Associated Press news story. On Jan. 12, 2011, a news story in the Dallas Morning News called Dewhurst the "first Texas lieutenant governor to have a security detail, though governors have had them for years." But the story quoted an unidentified spokesman for Dewhurst saying that Dewhurst did not request the security. In a political analysis published Jan. 14, 2011, Ross Ramsey of the Texas Tribune noted that Capitol security had been beefed up the year before in various ways including the placement of metal detectors at main entrances. An Austin American-Statesman news story published that day quoted Dewhurst as saying that the DPS "came to me months ago and recommended security, but I have resisted. In December, because of some credible threats, I agreed to it when I am in public places, public functions -- not all the time." Dewhurst did not elaborate on the threats. Dewhurst further said that his added security included an occasional DPS detail, driver and a state vehicle, a black SUV that had been in his parking spot outside the Capitol much of the week. The story further said that according to Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus and Attorney General Greg Abbott had also been provided state guards. To our telephone inquiries, Abbott spokesman Jerry Strickland said Abbott has a security detail, while Straus spokeswoman Erin Daly said Straus has not acceded to personal guards, though security was stepped up around the House in early 2011 in reaction to outside threats. Staples’ campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us by email that Staples would decline such protection. Staples "keeps his protection in his boot," Black said, which we took as a reference to a firearm. Security teams for past lieutenant governors? And what of previous lieutenant governors? Black said Staples, a former state senator, has known four lieutenant governors dating back to the late Bob Bullock, who left the office more than a decade ago. Dewhurst, Black said, "is the only one of the four who has utilized a full-time taxpayer-funded security detail. We have personally observed this detail," Black said. A state spokesman for Dewhurst, Andrew Barlow, reiterated what Dewhurst said in 2011, also saying that the "expanded security detail is just one of the" DPS’s "many changes in security protocol in the post-9/11 era, including restricted Capitol driveway access, security gates at Capitol parking garages and metal detectors at Capitol entrances." By phone, several Dewhurst predecessors told us they did not have security contingents. Bill Hobby, who held the gavel-wielding job from 1973 into 1991, told us he never had a detail. Former state Sen. Bill Ratliff said the same per his service as acting lieutenant governor from late 2000 through 2002. Ratliff added that Bullock, lieutenant governor from 1991 through 1998, "almost certainly" never had a security detail. Sen. Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat who briefly served in the post after Perry resigned to become governor in 2000, did not have a security detail, his spokesman, David Edmonson, said. Our ruling Staples called Dewhurst the first lieutenant governor of Texas to have a personal security detail. That appears so. Still, Staples’ statement could leave the impression that Dewhurst arranged for something unique for his own benefit. In contrast, Dewhurst was quoted years ago as saying that he did not initiate the protection and initially declined it. Also, Staples did not acknowledge that Capitol security was beefed up in various ways in 2010 and 2011 or that Dewhurst wasn’t alone in gaining a protective detail. We rate this claim, which lacked these clarifications, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06604	The city of Atlanta has either the highest or second-highest average water bills in the country.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/23/carla-smith/atlanta-drowning-nations-highest-water-bills/	t’s no secret to many homeowners in the city of Atlanta that they are floating in high water and sewer bills. Some say they’re drowning in the money they sink into city coffers. The issue came up during a recent City Council committee meeting where officials discussed a voter referendum set for February. The referendum would extend a penny-per-dollar sales tax to pay for ongoing work to repair Atlanta’s century-old sewer system, reduce pollution in the Chattahoochee River and improve its water quality. The sales tax, city watershed management officials say, is projected to bring in about $113 million in 2012. And if voters don’t continue the tax? Officials say they would have to raise monthly water and sewer rates on Atlanta users. "We can’t do a rate increase," Councilman C.T. Martin said. Particularly since homeowners saw their water bills rise by 12 percent in July, thanks to a series of annual rate increases passed by city leaders in 2008. The council’s Utilities Committee debated how legislation authorizing the referendum should be crafted at its Sept. 13 meeting. Councilwoman Carla Smith, who said she was running low on patience about the discussion, made a comment about water and sewer bills that might surprise some recent Atlanta homeowners. "We all know our water bills are the highest in the nation," said Smith, former chairwoman of the Utilities Committee. "Or the second-highest." The claim is repeated so often in Atlanta that we thought it’d be worthwhile to check it out. "We are pretty sure we are first," said Janet Ward, a spokeswoman for the city’s Watershed Management Department, focusing on research she’s seen. "Based on everything I know, we are No. 1." Here are some recent surveys we found: Black and Veatch, an engineering, construction and consulting company, looked at residential bills for water and wastewater in 50 large cities for three amounts of use for 2009 and 2010: 3,750 gallons, 7,500 gallons and 15,000 gallons. Atlanta users paid the highest average monthly rates for 7,500 gallons and 15,000 gallons. The bills were $154.30 and $327.70, respectively. Atlanta was a close second to Seattle in the 3,750-gallon category. Raftelis, a Charlotte-based consulting firm, helped conduct a study for the American Water Works Association in 2010. Atlanta’s wastewater rates were the highest among 30 large systems it studied. The city was fourth in water rates among those systems. Circle of Blue, a network of scientists, journalists and experts conducted a survey of water prices for 30 of the nation’s largest water and sewer systems. The average monthly bill for a family of four using 150 gallons of water a day in Atlanta was $126. That was a distant second to Santa Fe, N.M., where the average monthly bill was nearly $243 a month. New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection conducted a study of water and sewer rates that found Atlanta had the highest average annual residential rates among 24 cities studied, as of March 2008 at nearly $1,500 -- or $125 a month. Atlanta -- by far -- also had the highest average commercial rates, at more than $16,000 a year. Atlanta voters have twice passed referendums, by overwhelming margins, for the 1 percent sales tax for the water and sewer improvements. Water and sewer rates are rising across the country at rates higher than inflation, experts say. Circle of Blue found the average water bills increased by 9 percent in the past year in the cities it surveyed. Cities say it costs more money to treat water, buy it from wholesale suppliers and pay the workers -- and they are passing those higher costs along to customers, the organization found. Raftelis’ chief operating officer, Piper Brandt, said water and wastewater rates have each risen by an average of nearly 5 percent in large cities since 1996. Another reason governments are raising costs, Brandt said, is use is down because people are conserving more water and using more efficient appliances. Brandt believes governments had below-market prices and are trying to catch up. "Utilities have fixed costs and revenue is variable," Brandt said. Based on the research we’ve seen, none of which has been disputed, Atlanta has the highest monthly bills in most categories. When it is not first, Atlanta is typically second. Atlanta users may not want to toast a glass of H2O to this one, but Smith’s claim appears on target. We rate it as True.	None	Carla Smith	None	None	None	2011-09-23T06:00:00	2011-09-13	['None']
pomt-13646	Donald Trump says "all Mexicans are rapists."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/08/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-falsely-says-trump-said-all-mexicans-are/	Tim Kaine’s two-word description of Donald Trump is "trash talker." Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, used the term repeatedly during an Aug. 1 campaign rally in his hometown of Richmond. He accused Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, of "trash talking" about U.S. allies, foreign leaders, people with disabilities, women and other Republicans. "The thing that amazes me is the depth of his trash talking with Latinos, saying all Mexicans are rapists and going after Latino immigrants," Kaine said. No doubt, Trump has made controversial statements about the groups Kaine cited. But did Trump go as far as saying "all Mexicans are rapists?" We asked the Clinton-Kaine campaign for evidence. It cited 16 instances since June 2015 when Trump said that some of the unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. are hardened criminals and rapists. Topping the list was a Trump statement that made international headlines when he announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015. "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best," Trump said. "They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Trump’s statements about Mexican immigration have been discredited in fact checks. PolitiFact National has twice given Pants on Fire ratings to his claim that the Mexican government is sending violent criminals to the U.S. Trump hasn’t provided proof for his repeated claims and a number immigration say there’s no evidence to support them. Experts say unauthorized Latino immigrants usually come to the U.S. looking for jobs and to reunite with families that already are here. There’s no knowing the number or percentage of U.S violent crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants, because the U.S. doesn’t keep such statistics. There’s is strong evidence, however, that the border-crossers haven’t made the U.S. more dangerous. The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. grew from 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.2 million in 2012, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. That’s a 220 percent increase. During the same years, the violent crime rate in the U.S. declined by 47 percent, according to FBI data. Now, let’s get back to Kaine. His campaign, as we’ve noted, cited 16 times when Trump said "rapists" and other violent sorts are coming into the U.S. from Mexico. But Trump, in none of the quotes, made the charge that "all Mexicans are rapists," as Kaine said. There’s nothing that even approached such a contention. "Sen. Kaine was clearly referencing Trump's attacks on Latino immigrants -- as he said in his comments -- from Mexico," Amy Dudley, a national spokesprson for Kaine, wrote us in an email. Our ruling Trump has roiled emotions with his debunked claims that the Mexican government is sending "rapists" and other violent criminals into the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants." Kaine has embellished the controversy by saying Trump has said "all Mexicans are rapists." The Democrat doesn’t come close to proving his claim; all of the Trump quotes Kaine’s campaign sent us pertain to unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. No doubt, many Latinos have taken umbrage with what Trump actually has said. But Kaine put an insult into the mouth of Trump that never was uttered. So we rate Kaine’s statement False.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-08-08T00:00:00	2016-08-01	['Mexico']
pomt-14173	Says "Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion dollars."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/27/new-day-america/super-pacs-1-trillion-tax-claim-against-hillary-cl/	The day before the April 26 primaries in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, the John Kasich super PAC New Day for America was making calls to would-be voters featuring the recorded voice of Michael Reagan, a political consultant and son of former President Ronald Reagan. His claim about Hillary Clinton caught our ear. "Polls show Kasich's the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton in the fall. Trump loses. Cruz loses. And Kasich wins in a landslide. Isn't that what this race for president is really about? Becoming president? And if we don't win in November, Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion dollars," Reagan says. To put that number in perspective, the national debt has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. PolitiFact has looked at the presidential candidates' tax plans and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on a March 3, 2016, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion — $1.1 trillion in fact. But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long. Reagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: "Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes," according to the report. For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.) Clinton's plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States. However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce "incentives to work, save and invest." When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to Clinton's interview with the New York Daily News and an analysis by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan. "Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree," Wehrkamp said in an email. Our ruling New Day spokesman Reagan said, "Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion." Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years — longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn't fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion. Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data — that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its top tax rate drop dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74e26b13-8562-44ce-a220-60187aef6984 A previous version of this fact-check included an erroneous line about the per-individual share of the national debt should Clinton's plan go into effect. It has been removed.	None	New Day for America	None	None	None	2016-04-27T11:00:40	2016-04-25	['None']
pomt-01150	The wealth gap between blacks and whites in the United States is "greater than the black-white wealth gap was in apartheid South Africa."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/17/nicholas-kristof/missing-data-sinks-apartheid-wealth-gap-claim/	Since August, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof has written a series of columns aimed at showing that white and black Americans live in very different worlds. For Kristof, understanding this reality is essential if the country hopes to fix the trends that lie behind the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of the police. Comedy Central’s The Daily Show picked up on an interview Kristof did with CNN and inserted a clip in its Dec. 4, 2014, program. Kristof was making a fundamental point about inequality in the United States. "The race gap for wealth in the United States right now between the median white family and the median black family is 18-fold," Kristof said. "That’s greater than the black-white wealth gap was in apartheid South Africa." For those who might not remember, apartheid was the iron-fisted system of comprehensive segregation that held sway in South Africa until 1991. Nearly all the country’s land was reserved for whites. Non-whites were divided into Indians, coloreds and blacks. Laws decreed where nonwhites could live and blacks were isolated in regions dubbed Bantustans. Needless to say, all economic advantages flowed to whites while blacks faced enormous barriers. If disparities were greater today in America, it would be shocking indeed. We decided to probe into Kristof’s claim that the wealth gap is worse in the United States. A reminder: Wealth is distinct from income. It measures how much we own, not how much we make. While the two are closely tied, economists talk about wealth in terms of net worth. A house for example adds to our net worth if its value is higher than the amount of the mortgage. Assets minus debts gives you net worth. The latest government numbers back up the American slice of Kristof’s argument. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2011 the net worth for the median white household was 17.5 times greater than the median black household. That’s pretty much what Kristof said. His statement however runs into trouble on the South African side. Not because it is provably wrong, but because there is no data to back it up. In his corresponding newspaper column, Kristof backed his point with a link to a blog run by a former southern Africa bureau chief for the Washington Post. The blog said, "Racial inequality in apartheid South Africa reached its zenith in 1970 when black households’ median net worth represented 6.8 percent of whites’, according to an analysis of government data by Sampie Terreblanche, professor emeritus of economics at Stellenbosch University." Another way to say the same thing is that the median net worth of white households was nearly 15 times greater than that of blacks. That would put Kristof on solid ground, but for one thing. The economist Sampie Terreblanche told PunditFact that his analysis dealt with income, not wealth. "The per capita income of African blacks in South Africa was in 1970 only 6.8 percent of the per capita income of the Whites," Terreblanche said. "It is in Table 10.8 in my 2002 book The history of inequality in South Africa." When we told Kristof about this discrepancy, he contacted Terreblanche himself and heard the same thing. Terreblanche says he has only written about per capita income, not household wealth. While we cannot compare the wealth gap between apartheid South Africa and the United States, we can look at the income gap between the two countries. Through that lens, apartheid South Africa was far worse for blacks. Blacks in South Africa in 1970 earned 6.8 percent of the per capita income of whites. Blacks in the United States in 2009 earned 65 percent of the per capita income of whites, In 2013, the median household income of blacks in the United States was 59 percent that of whites. Ingrid Woolard is professor of economics at the University of Cape Town and heads South Africa’s national household panel survey the National Income Dynamics Study. "I am 99 percent certain that no household-level data exists on wealth in South Africa pre-1994," Woolard said. "I think people get confused between income and wealth. Even income data for black households prior to 1993 is patchy. There is very little wealth data for South Africa even post-apartheid." We found World Bank data on inequality in South Africa, but it examined the distribution of income, not wealth. While income and wealth often go hand-in-hand, they don’t always move the same way. The Pew Research Center noted that in America, since 1967, black-white income gap narrowed a bit, but the wealth gap grew wider. (We found different estimates of the black-white income ratio over time, with the complicating factor that in 1967 the Census Bureau did not distinguish between whites and non-Hispanic whites. Based on 1967 race categories, the number shifted from 58 percent in 1967 to 63 percent in 2013.) Our ruling Kristof said that for median families, the wealth gap in America now between blacks and whites is "greater than the black-white wealth gap was in apartheid South Africa." That statement is based on a blog post that in turn relies on a South African economist. Something must have become garbled because that economist told PunditFact he has written about disparities in income, not wealth. The two measures are very different. Another South African economist said she knows of no household wealth data for her country before 1994, which would be several years after apartheid ended. We do not doubt that the wealth gap between blacks and whites was large under apartheid but Kristof relied on a source that mischaracterized the data and spoke with a precision that could not exist. As such, no comparison to the wealth gap in America is possible. Without any supporting evidence, this claim rates False.

pomt-04677	Says that Mitt Romney's response to the crisis in the auto industry was, "Let Detroit go bankrupt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/jennifer-granholm/granholm-says-romneys-response-auto-crisis-was-let/	Judging by the number of times they have brought it up in Charlotte, N.C., Democrats are ecstatic about the resurgence of the American auto industry. They offer it as slam-dunk proof that government intervention can revive, not stifle, private enterprise. Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan, took her moment at the podium and got the crowd roaring as she touted President Barack Obama's response to the crisis. "He organized a rescue! He made the tough calls! And he saved the American auto industry! And you know, you know...Mitt Romney saw the same crisis and you know what he said: 'Let Detroit go bankrupt.' " Democrats like that line about Romney so much that, later in the speech, they projected the headline on the gigantic screen behind Granholm. But here are some facts. Romney wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in November 2008. The headline does say "Let Detroit go bankrupt," but Romney didn’t write that headline and those words don't appear in the text of the article. The line came from a headline writer at the New York Times. We thought we should look at what Romney actually said and see if it represents the sort of callous tough talk that Granholm suggests. Auto makers in crisis When Romney wrote that piece, the Big Three - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- had just asked Washington for a bailout. With sales at their lowest levels in decades, credit markets frozen and cash running short, they were after $25 billion in loans. Democrats favored the deal if the government got a stake in the firms and could swap out some of the automaker CEOs. Many Republicans favored bankruptcy. "I don't believe that the $25 billion they're talking about will make them survive," said Sen. Richard Shelby R-Ala. "It's just postponing the inevitable." Generally, Republicans opposed government intervention. They believed the carmakers suffered from fundamental problems that only a bankruptcy could flush clean. In that context, when people read the op-ed headline, they might have thought Romney meant "Let Detroit go belly up." But that was not his point. Romney offered a more nuanced view of what ought to emerge out of a bankruptcy. It is worth reading what he said: If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won’t go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed. Without that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself. With it, the automakers will stay the course — the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check. Romney called for a "managed bankruptcy." He didn’t define the terms, but he did list some of the desired outcomes. • New labor agreements to align pay and benefits to match those of workers at competitors such as BMW, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Plus, lower retiree benefits. • Management as-is must go. New faces should be recruited from unrelated industries. • A new direction for the United Auto Workers, profit sharing or stock grants to all employees and a change in Big Three management culture. • An end to executive perks such as jets and private dining rooms. Romney had other items on his list, including making sure shareholders and lenders took it on the chin. "They bet on management and they lost," he said. As for the government’s role, he said it should invest in basic research in energy, fuel efficiency and advanced materials that would help carmakers produce better vehicles. At the very end of the op-ed, Romney said, "the federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk." In 2012, about four years after that first op-ed, Romney wrote another one. In it, he wrote "The course I recommended was eventually followed. GM entered managed bankruptcy in June 2009 and exited it a month later in July. The Chrysler timeline was similarly swift." Romney went on to fault the administration for unfairly rewarding the unions with billions of dollars. "Crony capitalism" he called it. That criticism aside, Romney is right in that many of the outcomes he listed in 2008 came to pass. The health benefits of retirees were taken completely off the automakers’ books and became the sole responsibility of a trust fund. Labor costs fell dramatically and now are on par with those of Honda, Toyota and other foreign automakers. That trust fund holds a large stake in Chrysler and a much smaller but still significant stake in General Motors. It might not be the form of employee stock ownership Romney had in mind, but it does tie the fate of retired workers to the profits of the company. What Romney never mentioned in 2008 is what Washington would do to bring about those changes. The outcomes he praises came with a price tag of $23 billion, according to a recent Treasury Department estimate. That’s the gap between the $80 billion the government put into the deal and the $57 billion it expects back. Romney’s managed bankruptcy would have required massive amounts of private capital, capital that would have been a challenge to raise in the best of times and this took place during a financial meltdown. Without the infusion of cash from some source, all reports we have read and all observers we have found believe that some liquidation would have followed with much greater disruptions to the entire auto industry and the economy as a whole. However, no one knows for sure what would have been. Our ruling Granholm accused Romney of saying "Let Detroit go bankrupt." The line, a popular Democratic talking point, suggested that Romney wanted to let the auto companies go out of business. That was the headline, which he did not write, and he was not suggesting the auto companies should go belly-up. But he did advocate a managed bankruptcy that would produce carmakers with lower labor costs and products that could compete better in the marketplace. We rate the statement Half True. UPDATE: After we published this item, readers alerted us to a CBS TV interview where Romney addressed the "go bankrupt" question and he expanded on some of the things he mentioned in the op-ed about the need for a managed bankruptcy. Romney stood behind the title of his op-ed, "Let Detroit go bankrupt," but said his main point was to oppose government handouts with no strings attached and no demand that the automakers break away from the costs that were dragging them down. Bankruptcy was the way to make the necessary changes and would not be a liquidation. Romney did use the words about letting Detroit go bankrupt but his meaning was more nuanced and he emphasized that he was not referring to liquidation. Our ruling does not change.

pomt-07985	If the Stamp Farm wind turbine is built, the "health risk of 'flicker' impact created by shadows of blades of turbines poses real and significant health risks, particularly seizures."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/19/laurence-ehrhardt/north-kingstown-wind-turbine-critics-say-spinning-/	To some, spinning wind turbines are a majestic source of pollution-free energy. But when they're proposed for residential areas, opponents often portray them as a menace to healthy, safety, aesthetics and property values. The rhetoric can get pretty extreme. When one was proposed in Barrington in 2008, opponents claimed that unnamed "independent medical experts" had found that turbines can cause everything from headaches to heart problems, and that sunlight flashing through the blades can produce a stroboscopic effect that may lead to nausea, dizziness, disorientation and seizures. So when a massive 427-foot turbine was proposed for Stamp Farm on Route 2 in North Kingstown, it wasn't surprising that the opposition would echo those claims. One opponent was state Rep. Laurence Ehrhardt of North Kingstown. He co-authored an opinion column published in The Providence Journal with former North Kingstown Town Council President Edward Cooney. For one of their bullet points, they played the epilepsy card: "The health risk of 'flicker' impact created by shadows of blades of turbines poses real and significant health risks, particularly seizures." We've seen reports in the medical literature documenting that seizures can be caused by everything from Pokemon cartoons and "Super Mario Brothers" to the voice of former Entertainment Tonight host Mary Hart, but we've never seen any real evidence that wind turbines can trigger seizures. So we decided to investigate. We contacted Ehrhardt and Cooney to ask for their source for the statement. Ehrhardt said Cooney was responsible for that part of the commentary. Cooney sent us links to various articles available on anti-turbine websites. None of them offered any documented case histories of people having seizures because of wind turbines. Instead, they say the turbines "may" cause seizures and they raise other issues with similarly tenuous evidence. For example, North Kingstown opponents sent us to the website WindVigilance.com asserting that "the health impact of visual burdens cannot be underestimated." But the WindVigilance.com page, drafted by turbine opponents, doesn't say turbines pose a "real" seizure risk, as Ehrhardt and Cooney said. Instead, it says that flicker just "has the potential to induce photosensitive epilepsy seizures, however the risk is low with large modern models and if proper planning is adhered to." Similarly, opponents sent us copies of a research report that looked at flicker and epilepsy, but the report only examined the conditions that might cause a seizure. Cooney referred us to "a well-known study by Dr. Nina Pierpont, which addresses 'wind turbine syndrome' and the health risks associated with such." Pierpont's "study" is actually a book in which she reports on people who claim to have suffered all kinds of ills from living next to turbines, from blurred vision to rapid heart rate and panic attacks. But, according to her online resume, she has never published a study on any human health topic in any respected medical or scientific journal. One of her stated goals was to prove that the physical symptoms of the residents were real, not psychosomatic, a bias that most researchers try to avoid. In one of his emails, Cooney referred us to a 2007 report on wind turbines written by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. It reported that "Thus far, there has been relatively little dispassionate analysis of the human impacts of wind-energy projects. Much that has been written has been from the vantage points of either proponents or opponents." That report, written by a panel of experts, concluded that shadow flicker "can be a nuisance to people living near a wind-energy project" but the frequency of the flickering "is harmless to humans." In his e-mail, Cooney quotes the "harmless to humans" paragraph, which directly contradicts his claim. When asked about the contradiction, he responded: "I stand by my statement." Another piece of evidence supplied by Cooney was a portion of a report called "Planning for Renewable Energy. The section on flicker and epilepsy says only 0.5 percent of the population is epileptic, only about 5 percent of those are sensitive to flickering light, and less than 5 percent of those would be sensitive to the type of flicker produced by turbine blades. That's less than 1 in 80,000 people. We contacted two epilepsy experts who said the concern was ridiculous because it was so unlikely. David Mandelbaum, a neurologist and pediatrician at Brown University's Alpert Medical School, said even if an epileptic is sensitive to light, the flicker has to be at just the right frequency, and that frequency can vary widely from person to person. Dr. Gregory Kent Bergey, director of the epilepsy center at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said in an email: "The fact is, the great majority of people with seizures [probably greater than 95 percent] do not have this photosensitivity." Some patients may experience a brief spasm if they see the sun coming through the trees, "but these seizures are usually readily controlled by medication. I do not tell these patients not to drive in the forest!" He said "the risk from sun coming through a wind turbine would be very small -- the person would first have to be looking at the sun, not just at a turbine, and most of us know not to look at the sun directly. . . . We cannot use this as a reason not to erect wind turbine farms." Mandelbaum said he has never seen any reliable documentation that turbines can cause seizures, or any other health problems. "They're using the epileptic community. It's clever and it's nonsense, and I find it personally offensive," he said. Finally, we called a place where, if wind turbines did cause health problems, doctors would probably know about it. Cogdell Memorial Hospital is near what is reputed to be the world's largest wind farm, located in Roscoe, Texas. The farm has 627 turbines spread out over 100,000 acres and 4 counties. Several are located along Route 84, where motorists would be exposed to flicker. Said spokeswoman Belinda Kerr: "We have not seen or treated any illnesses or injuries related to these wind farms." In the end, there may be valid arguments to make both for and against wind turbines in residential neighborhoods. But the seizure risk that Ehrhardt and Cooney cite is not one of them. The "real and significant" health risks that they say turbine flicker poses are undocumented. If they exist, they are probably not very significant. To say that seizures are the best example is ridiculous. We wish there were a more environmentally-friendly solution, but the Truth-O-Meter calls for some carbon-based combustion. Pants On Fire!

pomt-02859	"Florida sheriffs unequivocally support" the "stand your ground" law.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/15/larry-ashley/florida-sheriffs-unequivocally-support-stand-your-/	Florida’s "stand your ground" law has been controversial both statewide and nationally since the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. But Florida legislators show no sign of backing away from it. The Florida House Criminal Justice Subcommittee rejected a repeal of the law during a five-hour meeting Nov. 7, 2013. The hearing was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, who had previously vowed not to change "one damn comma" of the law. At the hearing, supporters and critics lined up to speak about the law. Among the supporters are sheriffs, said Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Ashley. "Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to stand your ground," said the sheriff from northwest Florida. Ashley said that the "stand your ground" law expanded the "castle doctrine" -- the right for people to defend themselves at home -- to other places, including their neighborhood and the mall. "Florida sheriffs stand behind this law and oppose the repeal of it," said Ashley, who served on the task force formed by Gov. Rick Scott to examine the law after Trayon's death. The dictionary defines "unequivocal" as "admitting of no doubt or misunderstanding; clear and unambiguous." Ashley’s statement could leave listeners with the impression that Florida sheriffs’ have no doubts about the stand your ground law. Is that correct? Sheriffs association vote on ‘stand your ground’ The "stand your ground" law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. Trayvon, of Miami Gardens, was shot in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012, by George Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman. The "stand your ground" law was cited in the jury instructions, and in July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. The law became a touchstone in the debate about Trayvon's death. About a month after the acquittal, the Florida Sheriffs Association issued a press release expressing support for the law. "The right to self-defense is well-established in law," stated the Aug. 9 press release. "The Florida Sheriffs confirmed this position by voting unanimously, at the 2013 Florida Sheriffs Association Summer Conference, to support the 'stand your ground' law as it is currently written. Our current judicial system is comprised of multiple checks and balances to ensure fair and equitable application of all laws, including 'stand your ground.' " Ashley, who participated in the vote, told PolitiFact Florida that none of the sheriffs voiced opposition to the law during the association’s meeting at Marco Island in August. "As with any issue you can only measure support or opposition to a position when it is voiced at the time of its measurement," Ashley told PolitiFact Florida in an email. But some news reports about the association’s announcement questioned whether it was accurate to describe the vote as "unanimous." For starters, it was unclear how many sheriffs voted. The association reported that 57 of its 66 sheriffs registered for the conference, but the association didn’t record the number who participated in the vote -- some may have left before the vote or didn’t participate in it. "It was a large number of sheriffs," Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, the association president, told PolitiFact Florida. "I can’t tell you if it was 57, 52, 55. It is a well-attended session because that’s where we discuss things among ourselves that are of some importance." News reports indicated that some sheriffs -- including from large urban counties including Broward, Hillsborough and Orange -- didn’t participate in the vote and that a few sheriffs had some reservations about the law. Judd told PolitiFact that there was no written agenda that notified sheriffs ahead of time that they would take a vote on the "stand your ground" law. Judd said that sheriffs had heard that House Speaker Will Weatherford wanted input from law enforcement about the law, and that that’s what prompted the vote. Judd couldn’t recall for certain if he was the sheriff who brought up the topic, but he added that it might have been him. (Judd was elevated to the group’s presidency during the conference.) There was no written motion about the vote, but Judd said the wording was essentially: "Do you support Florida’s 'stand your ground' law?" "It was a unanimous vote and there was not a voice in opposition," Judd said. Judd said he was frustrated that news reports questioned his description of the vote as "unanimous." "Some reporters say ‘you didn’t have 100 percent of Florida sheriffs.’ You are missing the issue. We had 100 percent vote of the ones in the room that voted. ... It’s kind of like election day -- you don’t show up and vote, your vote doesn’t count." Judd said the association’s vote doesn’t stop any individual sheriffs from advocating for their personal views about the law. Sheriffs could weigh in again at their conference in February shortly before the legislative session. Some sheriffs have raised concerns about the law The vote is one thing; subsequent comments by sheriffs are another. We found news reports about seven sheriffs, a mix of Democrats and Republicans, who either raised concerns about the law or whose position about the law was unclear. In some cases, these sheriffs didn’t participate in the association’s vote. PolitiFact Florida contacted spokespersons for those sheriffs. Here’s a summary of our findings: Broward County: The Sun-Sentinel reported that Sheriff Scott Israel wasn’t at the Florida Sheriffs Association conference due to National Night Out events in Broward. Israel told the Sentinel in August that had he attended, "I would have voted against the FSA statement on the 'stand your ground' law. I support an individual's right to use armed self-defense when faced with the immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury, and without requiring any duty to retreat in one's own home. However, if there is a safe opportunity in other settings to retreat and de-escalate potentially deadly violence, it should be done. For this reason, I support legislative changes to more narrowly restrict the use of the 'stand your ground' defense." Israel expressed support for "fixing serious flaws" in the law in an October op-ed in the Sun-Sentinel. Pinellas County: Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told PolitiFact Florida in an email, "I was unclear as to exactly what was being asked in the motion," at the association meeting. "I did not verbalize a response when the voice vote was called." Gualtieri said that he "unequivocally" supports the broad concept of the "stand your ground" law. However, he said there is room for discussion about some adjustments. "I do not support the application of SYG immunity in circumstances where the person against whom deadly force was used was totally unarmed with any type of weapon when the force was used," Gualtieri said. "I also do not believe that someone deemed to be a 'primary aggressor' should be able to assert SYG — one does not get to pick the fight and then end it with deadly force." Hillsborough: The Tampa Tribune reported that Sheriff David Gee attended the conference but left before the vote. (We confirmed that directly with a spokeswoman.) He said he "wouldn't have voted that way without hearing the state attorneys out on that issue." In July 2012, Gee sent a response to an NRA questionnaire in which he declined to provide his personal opinion about self defense. "The Legislature has spoken on this issue," he wrote. "HCSO deputies always follow the law." Orange: A spokesman for Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told PolitiFact Florida that Demings attended the meeting but had to leave early to attend National Night Out events. The spokesman sent us a previous statement by Demings: "Had I been present, I likely would not have supported the vote. As a member of the Citizen Safety and Protection Task Force appointed by Governor Scott last year, I stand by the recommendations of the Task Force." Volusia and Flagler counties: The News Service of Florida reported that the sheriffs in Volusia and Flagler counties expressed reservations about the law. A spokesman for Volusia Sheriff Ben Johnson told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Johnson was in the room for the vote but did not participate in it. Johnson, a past president of the association, stands behind the association’s position on the law, but added that "his personal position differs slightly from that of the association. The sheriff supports the right of citizens to employ deadly force with no duty to retreat in order to defend themselves while in their homes or vehicles. However, when out in the open and facing a threat, the sheriff believes citizens should attempt to retreat if possible before using lethal force. He has consistently stated this position and supports the law, but believes it would be improved with the addition of three words (retreat if possible) as it relates to locations other than homes or vehicles." Meanwhile, Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, according to the News Service of Florida, "said the association's take doesn't exactly match his personal view. Manfre said he thinks the castle doctrine should remain on the books and the rest be repealed." (Manfre had no additional comment for PolitiFact Florida, his spokesman said.) Miami-Dade: Miami-Dade is the most populous county in the state and home to Trayvon, but J.D. Patterson -- the county’s appointed police director, the equivalent of an elected sheriff -- does not appear to have commented publicly about "stand your ground." According to Huffington Post, a spokesperson for Patterson confirmed that he attended the conference but couldn’t say if he voted. "Director J.D. Patterson was there and he does not wish to discuss the issue," Det. Alvaro Zabaleta told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Our ruling During a legislative hearing about Florida’s controversial "stand your ground" law, Okaloosa Sheriff Larry Ashley said "Florida sheriffs unequivocally support this, the right to 'stand your ground.' " The Florida Sheriffs Association did take a voice vote in August that the association reported was unanimous in support of the current "stand your ground" law. But no more than 57 of the state’s 66 sheriffs voted (and quite likely fewer) and a number of sheriffs, including those representing some of the state’s most populous counties, have spoken publicly or to PolitiFact Florida about their reservations about the law. Ashley’s comments left readers with the impression that the support among Florida is "unequivocal," or unambiguous, but that’s not the case. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00936	"We live in the most incarcerated country in the world."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/23/john-legend/fact-checking-john-legends-claim-we-live-most-inca/	And the Oscar for Best Real Talk in an Acceptance Speech goes to — Actually, that’s a tough one. Some of Sunday’s Oscar winners issued sincere pleas for wage equality, suicide prevention and calling your parents, not to mention lingering racial injustice 50 years after the civil rights movement. Musicians John Legend and Common left the audience with a tear-inducing performance of their Oscar-winning Selma anthem "Glory" and then a powerful message about setbacks for black Americans in voting rights, police relations and imprisonment. "We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world," Legend said. "There are more black men under correctional control today than there were under slavery in 1850." As for Legend’s latter claim, it is true in terms of raw numbers. There are almost double the number of African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision as male slaves in 1850 — about 1.68 million prisoners compared to about 873,000 slaves. (The claim isn’t as solid if you adjust for the share of the black population.) PunditFact wanted to take a closer look at the first half of Legend’s first claim. Is the United States really the most incarcerated country in the world? The London-based International Centre for Prison Studies is the best resource for comparing worldwide prison statistics, experts said, pointing to the group’s World Prison Brief, which is updated monthly as data becomes available. The United States led the world in raw numbers, with 2.23 million prisoners at the end of 2012. More than half of those prisoners were held in state prisons, followed by people held at local jails, federal prisons, juvenile detention facilities, military and U.S. territorial prisons, immigration detention facilities, and Indian country jails, according to a breakdown of the center’s data performed by the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population. Ranking just below the United States is China at 1.7 million, Russia at 671,700, Brazil at 581,500, and India at about 412,000. China’s population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid 2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.35 million in China, pushing it above the United States. But we can’t settle that possibility here. A better way to compare prison populations worldwide is to measure a country’s prison population as a share of the national population, experts told us. Adjusted for population, the United States’ prison population (707 prisoners per 100,000 population) exceeds countries around its size, including China. But according to the latest data, it ranks second -- not first -- worldwide. That distinction goes to the tiny nation of Seychelles, which posts the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the most recent data. Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said he would not ding Legend for not accounting for Seychelles. The countries are not at all in the same league. Seychelles is a group of African islands in the Indian Ocean northeast of Madagascar and is home to just over 90,000 people. For perspective, the least populous U.S. state is Wyoming with more than 580,000 residents. The addition of 240 Seychellois from 2012 to 2014 into an already small prison population dramatically pushes the rate from 707 prisoners per 100,000 population to 868, overtaking the United States. "I think countries that small are just not comparable," Wagner said, adding that his group’s 2014 States of Incarceration report filtered out countries with less than a half-million residents. What sets American prisons apart from the rest of the world? "We’ve criminalized so much behavior," said University of South Carolina criminology professor Geoff Alpert, singling out sentences for drug and property offenses in particular. Our ruling Legend said, "We live in the most incarcerated country in the world." The United States far and away incarcerates more people than its peers, in terms of the portion of its population behind bars, despite having a comparable amount of crime. Only Seychelles technically has a higher incarceration rate than the United States. But experts said it’s an outlier because of its miniscule size and largely should be disregarded. Maybe so, but it is a point at least worth noting. Legend’s Oscar-night claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04540	"Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last 50 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-families-are-their-lowest-/	In an interview with CBS’ 60 Minutes that aired on Sept. 23, 2012, President Barack Obama defended his economic policies of the past four years, including his tax policies. Interviewer Steve Kroft noted that on the campaign trail, Mitt Romney has been arguing that Obama is "crushing economic freedom with taxes, regulations and high-cost health care." Obama responded, "Yeah, well, it's a lot of rhetoric, but there aren't a lot of facts supporting it. Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last 50 years. So I haven't raised taxes. I've cut taxes for middle-class families by an average of $3,600 for a typical family." The numbers Since Obama said "probably in the last 50 years," we will be somewhat flexible on the time frame. The most detailed look at this question comes from a table compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed tax plans of the presidential candidates. The table calculates the average federal tax rate for four-person families at three different income levels -- one-half the median income, the median income, and twice the median income. The "average rate" means actual taxes paid as a percentage of a taxpayer’s income after deductions and exemptions. The table includes data from 1955 to 2011. For one-half the median income and the median income, average tax rates were lower in 2009, 2010 and 2011 than any year back to 1955 except for 2008. So Obama's largely right for these groups. For taxpayers earning twice the median -- which was just over $151,000 in 2011 -- tax rates were lower in Obama’s three years than in any year back 44 years, to 1968. But rates were lower for this group between 1955 and 1967. So by this measure, Obama’s claim wasn’t perfect either. These figures account for federal taxes only, so we also looked at different data that included all personal taxes -- federal, state and local. A president has the biggest influence over federal taxes but can also indirectly influence state and local taxation by expanding or shrinking the size of federal payments to the states. Using data from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, we calculated the percentage of personal income spent on taxes back to 1962. We found that taxes as a percentage of personal income has varied in a narrow range over that period, never falling below 9.6 percent and never rising above 14.3 percent. During the first three years of Obama’s presidency, taxes were 9.6 percent, 9.7 percent and 10.8 percent of personal income, respectively. Those are on the low end of this 50-year time span. The only other years to fall below the 2011 rate were 1964, 1965, 2003 and 2004. So, again, Obama’s statistical claim isn't entirely correct. Even though the exceptions to Obama's claim are few, they are significant -- none more so than 2008. During the Bush presidency of 2001 to 2008, average tax rates declined steadily. But they bottomed out in 2008 -- which was one year before Obama took office, and the year in which the recession hit full force. They then rose slightly under Obama. A key reason for the especially low rates in 2008 was the recession, experts said. "One expects taxes, in the aggregate, to decrease in a recession," said Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University. The reason: employment shrinks, incomes fall and people move to lower tax brackets. So while Obama’s policies, such as cuts to the payroll tax, did have some effect on today’s low average tax rates, the policies of his predecessor and the ripple effects of the poor economy Obama inherited also helped keep taxes at historically low levels. "Taxes are historically low right now mainly because of the worst recession since the Depression, and the fact that we have record high progressivity in the tax code, meaning heavy reliance on relatively volatile high incomes," said William McBride, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. Our ruling Obama said, "Taxes are lower on families than they've been probably in the last 50 years." On the numbers, his statistic isn't exact, but it's pretty close -- average tax rates are in fact lower than most years in the past five decades, at least for the three income groups we looked at. However, the decline in average tax rates was already under way under Bush and the recession helped keep them low. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03231	"Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/18/ron-kind/defending-obamacare-rep-ron-kind-says-increases-he/	On Aug. 2, 2013, when House Republicans staged their 40th vote to do away with all or part of Obamacare, Rep. Ron Kind rose to defend President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation. "Mr. Speaker, what turned out to be a silly exercise has suddenly turned into an insane exercise. We find ourselves, for the 40th time in the House of Representatives, debating repeal of the Affordable Care Act," the Wisconsin Democrat said on the House floor. "We understand they don't like it. But I beseech my colleagues on the other side to start working with us to improve a system that's in desperate need of reform, and make changes and adjustments along the way as we learn what's working and what isn't. That's the only way this can work." Then Kind, who took the microphone after Rep. James Bridenstine, R-Okla., made this claim: "But let me just inject a few facts in this debate, especially for the benefit of the previous speaker. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years." Let’s see whether Kind is right on the numbers -- and to what extent Obamacare is responsible. The numbers The most recent federal figures, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, show total public and private health care spending grew by the same rate -- 3.9 percent -- for three straight years: 2009, 2010 and 2011. Kind's spokesman, Peter Knudsen, confirmed to us that those were the years Kind was referring to when he spoke of "the last three years." The 3.9 percent is the smallest annual increase since 1960, the first year total health care spending statistics were kept. The total spending has never declined from one year to the next. That means Kind is mostly on target with the statistical part of his statement. Where he’s off is that the 3.9 percent increase in 2009 occurred before the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010. Now let’s turn to the other part of the statement: Kind's linking Obamacare with the record-low increases in health care spending. The credit Kind didn’t explicitly state that Obamacare alone is responsible for keeping a lid on spending on doctors, hospitals and other health care. His spokesman told us that Kind meant that Obamacare was merely one of many factors. But the implication was pretty strong. In defending Obamacare from a repeal attempt, Kind said that since the passage of the law, health care spending had been much lower. And he didn't cite any other reasons. We found widespread agreement among experts that many factors helped hold down the spending growth. And there is no consensus that Obamacare, which is still being implemented, was a leading factor. The experts who have weighed in on reasons for the smaller increases in spending include the American Medical Association, the Health Affairs journal and the federal government itself. Some experts have said Obamacare has helped rein in spending through steps such as reducing some Medicare Advantage payments; providing incentives that have led to fewer hospital-acquired infections and readmissions; and adding "accountable care organizations," which give physicians incentives to improve quality and lower costs. But many economists and others experts say the slowdown in health care spending simply reflects the overall economic slowdown. Other factors include expert cite for the slowdown in health care spending increases include a decline in private insurance coverage, changes in the design of insurance benefits, and a slower introduction of new drugs and technology. And when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the total health care spending figures for 2011, the agency concluded that Obamacare had "no discernible impact" on the slowdown in spending that year. Our rating Defending Obamacare, Kind said: "Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, U.S. health care spending grew at 3.9 percent for the last three years, the lowest growth rate in over 50 years." The statistical part of the claim is mostly accurate. But despite Kind’s implication that Obamacare was key in reducing the growth of health care spending, the evidence suggests its role was modest. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Kind a Half True.	None	Ron Kind	None	None	None	2013-08-18T05:00:00	2013-08-02	['United_States']

pomt-09871	If you log into the government's Cash for Clunkers Web site (cars.gov) from your home computer, the government can "seize all of your personal and private" information, and track your computer activity.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/03/kimberly-guilfoyle/glenn-beck-claims-governments-cash-clunkers-web-si/	On Glenn Beck's Fox News program on July 31, 2009, Fox anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that clicking on the government's Cash for Clunkers Web page (cars.gov) would give the government complete access to your home computer. The accusation came in a back-and-forth exchange among Beck, Guilfoyle and Jonah Goldberg, author of Liberal Fascism. After warning viewers not to try this at home, Beck typed in cars.gov., the U.S. Department of Transportation Web site for the program better known as Cash for Clunkers. "Here is Cars.gov," Beck said. "Let's say you go in. If I understand this right, I go in and I say, 'I want to turn in my clunker.' The dealer goes to Cars.gov, and then they hit 'submit transaction.' Here it says 'privacy act and security statement,' and it's like, oh, it's the Privacy Act of 1974. Whatever. I agree." But when you pull it up, he noted, here's how the warning statement read: "This application provides access to the DOT CARS system. When logged on to the CARS system, your computer is considered a federal computer system and it is property of the United States Government. Any or all uses of this system and all files on this system may be intercepted, monitored, recorded, copied, audited, inspected, and disclosed to authorized CARS, DOT, and law enforcement personnel, as well as authorized officials of other agencies, both domestic and foreign." "Good God Almighty!" Beck said. Said Guilfoyle: "Could it be any more broad and frightening? Here you are trying to be a good citizen and make a charitable contribution, do something that's good — and guess what? They are jumping right inside you, seizing all of your personal and private (information) ... And it's absolutely legal, Glenn. They can do it." "They can continue to track you basically forever," Guilfoyle warned. "Once they tap into your system, the government, of course, has like malware systems and tracking cookies and they can tap in anytime they want." "Can you believe that?" she asked. "I mean, seriously, they can get all your information." Later, Goldberg said it was "all very troubling. And, look, let me give you a hard example of this. Say you use Skype or some other Internet phone system, right? If you're on the phone while logged in on this thing, according to this, according to a lawyer I talked to before ... the government can legally listen to your phone call. They can check out what Web sites you've been searching." "Because it says ... your computer is a government's property," Goldberg said. "That's correct, if you log on to this at your home, everything in your home is now theirs?" Beck asked. "Basically," Guilfoyle said, "and there's nothing you can do." To dissect this one, we have to begin by noting the small amount of truth in their comments. The statement Beck read was on a government Web site for auto dealers, but Guilfoyle twists that into some incorrect claims about the government getting access to individuals. Here's the true part: The Department of Transportation confirmed the language was on the cars.gov Web site, but on Aug. 3 it was removed. The DOT released this statement to PolitiFact: "A security warning on the CARS.gov dealer support page that stated computers logged into the system were considered property of the Federal Government has been removed. We are working to revise the language. The language was posted on the portion of the website accessible by car dealers and not the general public." "It would be factually inaccurate to say that any computer that went to cars.gov would become the property of the U.S. government," said Sasha Johnson, a DOT spokeswoman said. Although Beck began his segment by noting that the warning was on a part of the site for dealers, Guilfoyle then distorted the truth by suggesting it applied to members of the general public coming to the site for information about Cash for Clunkers. The allegations escalated as she and Goldberg issued warnings about anyone even typing in that address at home. And that's just wrong. Beck seemed to concede that point when raising the issue again on Aug. 3. "Now, these blogs have come out this weekend and said, 'Oh, there goes Glenn Beck trying to stir up trouble again. It doesn't affect the average person. It's just the car dealerships.' I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the car dealerships. Oh, so then I shouldn't care? It's not the average people? It's just the average people who are in small business running the car dealerships," Beck said. DOT's Johnson said the government has no plans to take over the computer of auto dealers either. And, again, the language was removed on Aug. 3. But the language was there when Beck and Guilfoyle first raised their concerns. And clearly the language was overly broad, and bad enough to give ammunition to conspiracy theorists. That much is implied by the fact the government felt the need to remove the language. So in that sense, we think the DOT bears some blame for the confusion. Had she said from the start that this just applied to dealers completing transactions, we might be more generous in our ruling. But we think anyone who saw the July 31 program — in which she claimed "seriously, they can get all your information" — would be left with the clear impression that anyone who logged into the cars.gov site was opening their computer to Big Brother. And that's False.	None	Kimberly Guilfoyle	None	None	None	2009-08-03T17:57:16	2009-07-31	['None']
pomt-08021	Wisconsin’s lawsuit rules are so anti-business that the state’s system is "one of the most promiscuous" in America.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/09/national-federation-independent-business-wiscons/national-federation-independent-business-says-wisc/	The business community’s years-long drive for tighter limits on injury-liability lawsuits got a huge boost when Republicans took control of state government in January 2011. Even though Gov. Scott Walker immediately proposed a list of business-backed legal changes, business leaders began mobilizing to respond to trial lawyers’ attempts to cast the initiatives as anti-consumer. The Wisconsin chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business portrayed mom-and-pop companies as easy prey when people sue over harm from defective products, negligent care, accidents and other injuries. "Wisconsin has one of the most promiscuous tort systems in the country in which small businesses are easy targets for baseless lawsuits and civil penalties that are entirely disproportionate," said Bill Smith, state director of the group, in a Jan. 4 news release in support of Walker’s proposals: The release added, "The impact of a single lawsuit on small business can be devastating." The other side -- plaintiff’s trial lawyers in a lobbying coalition known as the Wisconsin Association for Justice -- say the reforms will devastate some victims. In this item, we’re not sorting out the policy implications of the proposed changes. We’re looking at whether -- as Smith said on behalf of the group claims -- Wisconsin is on the extreme edge in terms of being a pro-plaintiff state in injury cases. Smith pointed to a 2010 Pacific Research Institute ranking of states that he said puts Wisconsin at 35th -- or 16th-worst in the United States -- for an anti-business lawsuit climate. The institute is a free-market think tank based in California. He also pointed us to Andrew Cook, a lawyer working with the Wisconsin Civil Justice Council, a business coalition lobbying for tighter lawsuit controls. The two noted three areas of liability law where they say Wisconsin court rulings have put the state out of the mainstream. One involves a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that allowed a Milwaukee lead-paint lawsuit even though no single specific manufacturer could be tied to the paint. Cook noted that a leading expert, University of Maryland law professor Donald Gifford, said that put Wisconsin alone among states. A second is product liability, in which Wisconsin is one of just four states that continue to rely on a legal standard that critics say makes it too hard for manufacturers to defend themselves. The third involves expert testimony in complex cases. Wisconsin is one of 14 states that have rejected tougher requirements for scientific proof of experts’ opinions, as set out in a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court case. Of course, Smith did not quote any of those individually. He made a more sweeping statement. Let’s weigh the evidence. The Pacific Research Institute study cited by Smith is widely quoted but comes with an agenda: the group is openly in favor of tighter controls on lawsuits. That doesn’t make it a bad study, but there’s a much bigger issue with Smith’s use of it as a defense: The study actually rates Wisconsin as among the best in the country for its lawsuit climate from a business standpoint -- ninth among states. The No. 35 ranking -- cited by Smith -- was mentioned in the study. But that ranking judged the set of laws and rules on each state’s books, not the actual outcome in terms of volume of lawsuits, damage awards and settlements. The group’s study makes clear that the information on the state of the law can’t be used as a precise measure or comparison. The study bases its state-by-state rankings on results -- and Wisconsin was No. 9 on that score. Leading the pack was Alaska. In the study’s foreword, then-Gov. Sarah Palin says said "we practice the rule of law, not the rule of lawyers as in other states." The study credited Wisconsin with having very low losses in auto, medical malpractice and commercial cases. It said the risk of litigation here was 10th-lowest in the country. It said the state has no "judicial hellholes," which it defined as places where the courts are sought out by personal injury lawyers because they are so friendly to plaintiffs. That’s a far cry from how Smith portrayed it on behalf of his group. So, according to the study: Wisconsin has comparatively anti-business laws and rules on going to court, but it does not produce much for plaintiffs when they get there. How can that be? Daniel Rottier, a Wisconsin personal-injury lawyer with national experience, says the answer lies in the conservative nature of Wisconsinites. He says they are less inclined to hit companies with big damages than jurors in many other states. The only other national study mentioned by either side is done by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In that study, Wisconsin’s lawsuit system, from the business perspective, ranked 22nd last year and between 10th and 24th in seven previous years, based on a survey of corporate lawyers. A No. 1 ranking meant most business friendly. That puts Wisconsin in the middle of the pack. Beyond the rankings, Smith and Cook cited specific types of cases where the state’s highest court has taken a liberal tack on some specific areas of liability law. The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling on lead-paint manufacturer’s liability was unprecedented. And we are in the minority of states in how we approach product liability and expert testimony. Whether the proposed changes will have much impact on those areas is a hotly debated point. "They are out of whack," said Brooklyn Law School Professor Aaron Twerski, an author of product-liability standards adopted in whole or in part by most states but not Wisconsin. "It’s makes it too hard for defendants." Wisconsin Supreme Court justices are divided on adopting the more-popular new standard, a review of relevant rulings found. But we are not divided on judging NFIB-Wisconsin’s statement. In making the case for the Walker-proposed reforms, the group says the state has one of the "most promiscuous" legal climates in the country. Smith, the group’s state director, cites some individual points, including the lead paint ruling, where Wisconsin stands out. But the larger study he cites undercuts his own main point. It shows that Wisconsin -- based on 42 separate measures -- is actually among the best for business, not the worst when it comes to outcomes. The only other study cited in the debate, by the obviously pro-business U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had Wisconsin squarely in the middle of the pack. The verdict is in. We rate the group’s claim False.

pomt-01711	"In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/08/facebook-posts/1978-someone-minimum-wage-could-earn-enough-summer/	Everything was better in the old days, apparently -- including the chore of paying for college, at least according to a social media meme sent to us recently by a reader. The meme -- created by OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, "In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice." Really? We figured this was worth a look. First, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the minimum wage was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors. For the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government’s repository of education data. The cost of tuition and fees (in that year’s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university. So the meme’s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant: • The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year -- $2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite "tuition" only, so we’ll ignore the impact of room and board. • The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers. • The meme’s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase "of their choice." The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate only at their home-state university. That’s not the same thing as "of their choice." Our ruling The meme said that "in 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice." If you use the national average the figure is correct. The only problem is the part about a university "of their choice." The data is correct for in-state tuition -- not for any university in the country, where out-of-state rates may well have kicked up the tuition amount beyond a summer’s minimum-wage haul. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: After we published this article, a reader noticed that we had used the incorrect tuition figure from the National Center for Education Statistics chart. This version uses the correct figure. The rating remains at Mostly True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-08-08T12:09:05	2014-08-07	['None']
pomt-08302	"(John) Kasich was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/31/john-kasich/john-kasich-touts-role-balancing-budget-creating-s/	Jobs are the central theme of this fall’s election campaigns, and John Kasich's TV ad "Busted" neatly delivers the Republican candidate's two-pronged message about the state's economy: The policies of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland have failed, and Kasich can do better. "Kasich," the ad says, "was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation." It's a sweeping claim that begs for explanation and context. The ad doesn't provide it. Neither does the posting about the ad on the campaign's blog, though it more helpfully calls Kasich "chief architect of the 1997 Balanced Budget." PolitiFact Ohio looked into the record for more. We started with "Balanced Budget." That refers to the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, H.R. 2015, a bipartisan agreement to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. The 537-page bill was sponsored by Kasich, a U.S. House member representing a suburban Columbus district from 1983 through 2000 and chairman of the House Budget Committee. The legislation also promised the first major tax cuts in 16 years, and it reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments to health care providers. Kasich was widely recognized as the its chief architect and a key player in negotiating its passage. When President Clinton signed the agreement into law, Kasich stood beside him in the Rose Garden. Failure is an orphan, but success has a thousand fathers -- or custody-seekers. Newt Gingrich, Kasich's mentor and then-speaker of the House, called him "a historic figure. More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget." Clinton, appearing in Cleveland for Strickland in September, said Kasich "always tells people that he brokered for the Republicans the balanced-budget bill that I signed. That is true but misleading" -- because, Clinton said, Kasich earlier was among congressional Republicans who shut down the government because the president refused to slash federal agencies and programs. Regardless, conditions were comparatively favorable for the budget agreement. It came amid a booming economy and increased tax revenues that already had driven down the deficit, ultimately leading to a surplus. (The increase in tax revenues is credited to the improved economy and to tax increases that were part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.) Clinton announced that surplus in September 1998, a year after the agreement was signed. It was the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000. Republicans claimed credit, saying they had pressured Clinton to adopt their balanced-budget commitment. Clinton said he and congressional Democrats deserved the credit for passing the 1993 budget bill, which did not win a single Republican vote in the House and which Cinton has said "led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America." (PolitiFact examined that claim in detail last April and rated it Half True. The economy did improve after the 1993 budget bill became law, but economists say many factors played a role.) Unemployment was one key indicator of the economy's health. It fell from 4.9 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 2000, continuing a steady decrease that started in 1993. But the impressive amount of job creation does not mean that a record number of jobs were added. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 3,154,000 jobs in 1998 -- about 100,000 more than were created in 1997 -- and another 3,063,000 in 1999. But neither year reaches the peak of 3,447,000 jobs in 1994. (Job creation began to slow in 2000.) Kasich deserves credit for conceiving, sponsoring and negotiating passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. But the ad overstates his role by saying he balanced the budget. And it exaggerates by giving Kasich, or the the budget agreement, credit for a surplus or "record" job creation. We rate Kasich’s statement as Half True.

pomt-14114	"There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. … And that’s just within the last year."	false	/california/statements/2016/may/11/duf-sundheim/duf-sundheim-wrongly-says-californias-violent-crim/	Republican Duf Sundheim started on the attack at Tuesday’s debate in San Diego among five candidates vying to be California’s next U.S. senator. But the GOP hopeful missed hard on a fact about the state’s violent crime rate. He used his opening remarks to criticize the race’s frontrunner, Democratic California Attorney General Kamala Harris. "The PPIC (Public Policy Institute of California) recently reported that Kamala is failing to keep us safe," Sundheim said May 10, 2016. "There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. … And that’s just within the last year." The PPIC, a nonpartisan think tank, reported no such thing. What the PPIC said The PPIC report cited by Sundheim doesn’t include final statewide violent crime data for 2015. It has preliminary statistics for January to June 2015 for 66 California cities covering about half of the state’s population. Brandon Martin, the co-author of the report and a research associate at the policy institute, told PolitiFact California that statewide crime statistics for 2015 won’t be available until this summer. Moreoever, Sundheim misstated the preliminary data that the PPIC did have. The authors of the report said 34 of the 66 California cities saw a double-digit percentage increase in violent crimes. They never claimed that the state, or even the sample of cities, saw a 34 percent increase in violent crime. "I have not seen any data showing a 34 percent increase in crime in California in 2015. He made a mistake," Magnus Lofstrum, the study’s author and a senior fellow at PPIC, told PolitiFact California. The most recent full-year crime stats, from 2014, put the state’s violent crime rate at a 47-year low, according to the PPIC. A spokeswoman for Sundheim’s campaign said, "Looking at the study, the wording is vague and our researchers believed that the '34' was in reference to the percent rise in violent crime."

pomt-13485	Says Patrick Murphy advocated for "cuts to Social Security and Medicare."	false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/patrick-murphy-wanted-cut-social-security-and-medi/	The GOP is attempting to link Senate hopeful and U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy to the third rail of Florida politics, saying he wants to cut both Social Security and Medicare. Playing off questions about Murphy’s job history, the National Republican Senatorial Committee created a website called RealMurphyResume.com. The site spins a partisan look at the Jupiter Democrat’s qualifications and policy positions, and says one of his priorities was to "Advocate for cuts to Social Security and Medicare." When we first looked over the website on Sept. 7, 2016, we wondered if Murphy really did say he wanted to cut the two programs for seniors. The evidence doesn’t suggest that’s the case. ‘Structural changes’ The NRSC told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy had said as much in a CNN interview on Jan. 2, 2013 — the day before he started his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives. CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield asked Murphy what he was prepared to do to find common ground in a partisan Congress that had begrudgingly reached a compromise over budget negotiations — a situation usually referred to as the "fiscal cliff." The House had passed a bipartisan agreement on Jan. 1 that fended off big income tax increases on most Americans and prevented huge cuts in defense spending and other programs. In the interview, Murphy said he wanted to help the House make "big choices" to move ahead without similar battles in the future. When Banfield asked him what those choices were, he said he didn’t think Congress should continue to delay action on passing a budget or shoring up benefits programs. "Unfortunately, we have to look at cuts across the board," he said. "We're going to have to look at defense. We're going to have to look at some structural changes to some programs like Social Security and Medicare." He went on to say he wanted to eliminate "fraud, waste and abuse." He said he thought his CPA training would be helpful in going through the budget to find the best places to cut. Later in the interview, Banfield asked Murphy if he would break away from his party on any issue during negotiations, and where he thought Congress could make "painful cuts" if needed. "You know, I think we're going to have to make some structural changes to programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid," he answered. "We're going to have to make sure they're sustainable for years to come." The NRSC did not provide any more evidence of Murphy’s position on Social Security and Medicare. Murphy’s primary opponent in this year’s Senate race, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, had used this same line of attack, editing the quote to, "We have to look at cuts across the board, uh, to some programs like Social Security and Medicare." But in full context, Murphy said "structural changes," which is not the same as cuts. We couldn’t find any clear evidence that Murphy had voted for or advanced any legislation that would have cut the programs. His campaign told us Murphy was referring to raising the taxable income limit for the payroll tax, and allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices. There are some examples of Murphy wanting to prevent cuts to the programs. On Murphy’s 2012 campaign website — archived on the Wayback Machine — he vowed to protect both Social Security and Medicare. He said he would fight attempts to privatize Social Security and cut the program, and oppose moving Medicare patients to the open market. Three weeks after joining the House, Murphy offered a motion to change a debt ceiling bill in order to prevent future benefit changes for seniors and veterans. The failed motion sought to keep Congress from changing Medicare to a voucher plan and privatizing Social Security in 2014 budget negotiations. He subsequently made similar actions through his term, although many of them failed in the Republican-led House. In August 2014, Murphy spoke out about increasing the taxable income limit for the payroll tax, which was $117,000. Income above that threshold is not subject to the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Taxing income above that would bring more money into the program. "If you’re going to be honest about addressing Social Security you have to, I think, take a broad approach to it and look at all options. That is the easiest option, raising that cap to a larger number," Murphy said. He signed onto a bipartisan letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in March 2015, asking the agency to abandon proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage. CMS decided to increase Medicare Advantage payments instead. Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Murphy advocated for "cuts to Social Security and Medicare." The attack focused on one interview from before Murphy officially joined Congress. While Murphy said cuts were possible, he pointed out Congress will need to focus on "structural changes" to the two programs. Murphy’s efforts to protect Social Security and Medicare have focused on protecting seniors and veterans, but we didn’t find any clear evidence he has endorsed or voted for legislation to cut current or future benefits. We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bff30e2-953f-4e8f-849b-f74b54025e61	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-08T16:09:30	2016-09-07	['Social_Security_(United_States)']

The image did not disclose that the quotes were satirical. "Senate Democrats demand Supreme Court nominee not be unduly influenced by U.S. Constitution," the image said in bold yellow font. The image featured photos of Sens. Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, each with a quote attributed to them. The quotes purported to portray the Democratic senators as more interested in pushing an agenda than abiding by constitutional laws. "Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down," Schumer is quoted saying. "And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end." The image also quoted Warren saying, "We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws, not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda." Finally, the image alleged that Booker said, "We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do." Several readers sent us emails flagging the image and asking that we check it out, so we did. We discovered that each quote is entirely made-up. As it turns out, the quotes can be traced to a June 29, 2018, article from the Babylon Bee, a website that describes itself as "your trusted source for Christian news satire."

pomt-10089	"For my energy plan, my economic plan, and the other proposals you'll hear tonight, I've offered spending cuts above and beyond their cost."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/30/barack-obama/proposed-cuts-are-too-vague/	In his half-hour prime time political ad on Oct. 29., Sen. Barack Obama made his case for a number of new initiatives for such things as health care, education and energy. Those will cost money. But Obama assured that for all of his new spending proposals, he’s proposed commensurate spending cuts, and then some. "Across the country, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington," Obama said. "That’s why, for my energy plan, my economic plan, and the other proposals you’ll hear tonight, I’ve offered spending cuts above and beyond their cost." Note what Obama is not saying here. He is not saying he will reduce the federal deficit, or even stabilize it. A number of non-partisan budget and tax analysts say that the deficit is likely to grow considerably under Obama’s plan - mostly due to his proposed tax cuts for the middle class. What Obama did say is that for all of his new spending initiatives, he is proposing offsetting spending cuts. "I think he can go out with a clear conscience and claim that," said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which performed a detailed analysis if the budget impact of the Obama and McCain plans as revealed through the camapign. But it's based on a number of shaky assumptions, she said. Obama has proposed several nitiatives - expanded health care coverage, investments in alternative energies and increases in education spending, foreign aid and the size of the military - that the CRFB estimates at a cost of about $220 billion. On the "savings" side of the ledger, the Obama campaign includes ending the Iraq war, letting tax cuts expire for people who earn more than $250,000, closing corporate tax loopholes, discouraging offshore tax havens and reducing wasteful spending. The campaign says all those changes would yield several hundred billion dollars a year. For example, ending the Iraq war — the first five years of which cost $600-billion, according to the Pentagon — would save between $90-billion and $100-billion a year, the Obama campaign asserts. All the savings together would easily be enough to pay for all the programs Obama mentioned, along with all the other new spending and tax cuts he plans, the campaign says. But the Obama campaign uses a few "gimmicks" to make its numbers work, said MacGuineas, a former adviser to the 2000 McCain for President campaign. For example, the Obama campaign includes "savings" realized by a phased-down withdrawal of combat troops in Iraq. The CRFB put a $156 billion tag on that. But to include that figure as "savings" is shaky, MacGuineas said, inasmuch as it’s double counting to include reductions in policies that we are already borrowing to pay for. It also assumes that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 would be extended indefinitely, even though they are set to expire in 2010. That way, Obama can claim savings with his proposal to eliminate those tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year. The Obama plan is also short on details when it comes to spending cuts, MacGuineas said. For example, the campaign has pledged to save tens of billions of dollars by "reducing and reforming government contracting" and "reducing wasteful spending." The campaign gives a few examples, she said, "not enough to fill in all of the (claimed) savings." "All of his plans to spend money have far more specifics than his plan to save money," MacGuineas said. It’s that lack of detail that makes many budget experts skeptical of Obama’s claim. Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that advocates budget restraint, said it’s a leap of faith to put a monetary figure to something like Obama’s plan to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. Which waste exactly? Which fraud? Which abuse? "In the sense that they are trying to come up with offsets to the spending plans they are proposing, that’s a good thing," Gordon said. "Whether the numbers are completely accurate, I think even the campaigns would admit they are just best guesses." Isabel Sawhill, an associate budget director during the Clinton administration and a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said she has yet to see specific proposals for spending cuts from the Obama campaign that go beyond his more specific spending plans. "Frankly, it’s a mystery," Sawhill said. "He’s been petty vague." That’s often true with presidential campaigns, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Does a candidate get credit for being more fiscally responsible if they talk about larger, unspecified savings? "I think the best you can do is get a sense of what the candidates priorities are," Horney said. "But at the end of the day, it’s difficult to add it all up and come up with a number, then later be able to back that number up." And even if all of Obama’s proposals were budget neutral, Gordon said, the country’s existing debt would continue to grow. Without any changes to current policies, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $2.3 trillion budget deficit over the next decade. "If there’s not a net tax increase or a net cut in spending, we’re just treading water as the ship is going under," Gordon said. The "all paid for" logic also assumes you don’t include Obama’s proposals for a host of refundable tax credits. Some would argue those are simply spending initiatives dressed up as tax cuts. "The overall effect of the these policies, there’s no question it would put the country deeper in debt," MacGuineas said. "His plan will significantly increase the budget deficit." A detailed analysis of the Obama tax plan by the non-partisan Tax Policy Institute concluded Obama’s tax plan would increase the country’s debt by $3.5 trillon over 10 years. They estimated McCain’s tax cut plan would boost the deficit even more, by $5 trillion. "He (Obama) is digging a $3.5 trillion hole that has to be filled with spending cuts," said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. To be fair, Obama has not pledged to cut the deficit. "I do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013," Obama said, "because I think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in America’s families." Still, experts agree that while Obama has made efforts to correlate new spending initiatives with proportionate spending cuts, his proposals to cut spending make too many best-case-scenario assumptions and are far too vague to be relied upon. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05938	"Romneycare … is a top-down, government-run health care system."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-calls-massachusetts-health-law-top-d/	It’s like a new cover of an old song. During a Republican primary debate on Jan. 26, 2012, Rick Santorum said that the health care legislation Mitt Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts is "a top-down, government-run health care system." The former Pennsylvania senator called the issue one of "fundamental freedom" and criticized Romney for enacting a law similar to the one that passed nationally in 2010. And the beat goes on. PolitiFact has explored the Massachusetts health program extensively, considering its similarities to the federal law and examining what role the government really plays in it. Here are a few important points: • Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. • Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees must offer health insurance or pay a penalty. • Health insurance exchanges. The plan involves the use of voluntary "exchanges" through which individuals and small businesses may purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. • Affordability subsidies. Lower-income individuals and families receive government subsidies to help pay their health insurance premiums. Subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. • Expansion of Medicaid. The plan expands Medicaid to all children whose families earn up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. • Insurance market regulation. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 may be covered on their parents' plan. We think Santorum’s use of the label "top-down" reflects his political opposition to both the Massachusetts plan and the national plan modeled after it. Given that opposition, a person could consider an individual mandate a "top-down" approach to health care, although others would disagree. But "government-run?" That characterization is simply wrong. We asked Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, to explain: "The Massachusetts plan leaves private health insurance intact, and under the Massachusetts plan, health care delivery remains predominantly in private hands, as it was before the law was enacted," he wrote in an email. "The role of government is expanded, but that is not the same as saying the government ‘runs’ the health system. The Massachusetts plan expanded Medicaid, but at the same time it expanded uninsured residents’ access to private insurance (through subsidies to buy coverage and the connector)." What does an actual government-run system look like? Oberlander pointed to the truly socialized system of Great Britain -- as well as to one in our own backyard. "The Massachusetts plan ... looks NOTHING like a true ‘government-run health care system... the VA’s health system where the government owns the hospitals and employs doctors directly," he said. Our ruling Santorum called Romney’s health law "a top-down, government-run health care system." The individual mandate and the requirement that employers offer health insurance might be considered top-down, though it is still a system that relies heavily on private insurance and private medical providers. But there’s no case to for calling it "government-run." A real government-run system has doctors on the payroll. Massachusetts does not. We rate Santorum’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01956	The Senate proposal to restore emergency unemployment benefits for five months was "fully paid for."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/22/jack-reed/us-sen-jack-reed-says-proposal-restore-emergency-u/	When the recession hit, federal unemployment benefit coverage was temporarily expanded to as long as 73 weeks, depending on the state. When that expansion expired on Dec. 28, 2013, the maximum dropped back to 26 weeks. The U.S. Senate, controlled by Democrats, subsequently voted to restore emergency benefits for five months, through the end of May. That proposal languished in the Republican-controlled House and was considered dead, especially now that it would no longer benefit those added to the unemployment rolls as of June 1. But Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), a strong advocate for restoring those extended benefits, said earlier this month that there's still a push to extend them, although not retroactively. One of Reed's arguments, made repeatedly on the floor of the Senate in speeches on April 10 and May 1, and during a May 1 news conference, was that the original proposal was "fully paid for." With the U.S. government in debt to the tune of $17.5 trillion -- that's $55,000 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. -- one could question whether anything in the current $3.5 trillion federal budget would be fully paid for, especially when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was projecting a shortfall of $492 billion for the current fiscal year. Question: So if the proposal was "fully paid for," how would the government have covered the $9.9 billion cost of extending the benefits for five months? Answer: With extra tax revenue collected over the next 10 years. When we contacted Reed's office, spokesman Chip Unruh sent us an analysis from the CBO. Aaron Hernandez, a senior policy adviser for Reed, walked us through the complicated plan. Most of the immediate revenue -- $1.7 billion just this year -- would have come from giving companies the option to lower the amount of money they have to pay into their pension plans over the short term. Therefore, that would leave more money in profit for the feds to tax. In theory, by the 2017 fiscal year, more than enough would have been collected to cover the cost of Reed's legislation. However in subsequent years, those companies would have to pay extra into their pension plans to catch up, producing less taxable income and a loss of revenue for the federal government, beginning in 2020. To compensate for that, the legislation called for a one-year extension of customs fees that were set to expire nine years from now. The feds would have, in essence, extended that tax to 2024 and use the revenue to directly cover the long-term costs of fiddling with the pension payment system. Unruh, Reed's spokesman, said the senator "is 100 percent correct in saying that it's fully paid for" when all the revenue is taken into consideration under Washington's rules for balancing out changes to the budget. Reed, he said, made it clear in an April 2 floor speech that the payment would have been spread out over 10 years. But we note that in the two speeches and one news conference we saw, Reed repeatedly asserted that the bill "is fully paid for," making no reference to how the cost would be covered or how long it would take. We asked some budget experts what they thought of the explanation from Reed's office. "When people think about things being paid for, they think about making difficult choices," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, which monitors budget issues. But when that phrase is used in Washington, he said, "it's not in the sense of, 'I've got to fix my roof so I'm not buying the flat screen TV.'" Reed "has the offsets, and according to the CBO it's paid for. But that's not the whole truth here. He's spending money today and promising to pay for it many years from now," he said. "It's a gimmick." Joshua Smith, a senior policy analyst with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that supported extending the benefits, put it in different terms. "It's technically true, but it's only technically true as long as you understand how CBO does budget scoring," Smith said. "They use a window that is 10 years long, so if it doesn't cost money over 10 years, it doesn't add to the deficit." "It's true in Washingtonese. Members of both parties have been doing exactly the same thing for a long time, saying things are fully paid for if they are paid for within the 10-year window," said Smith. "The bill does attempt to cover its costs, unlike some things that are going through Congress now, such as unpaid-for corporate tax breaks." Chris Edwards, economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, called the funding plan "a classic example of phony Washington smoke and mirrors accounting," that is all too common by both parties in Washington. "The biggest joke is the customs fees -- three and a half billion dollars, 10 years from now, in a single year," he noted. "The lobby groups have 10 years to work to reverse that particular fee, and they probably will." Leonard Lardaro, professor of economics at the University of Rhode Island, called the funding plan "really murky." The accounting assumes revenue that may not be there over the years, he said, calling the savings "speculative." Our ruling Jack Reed repeatedly said that the Senate proposal to restore expanded unemployment benefits "is fully paid for." He didn't say it would be paid for in the future. He made it sound like it HAD been paid for, presumably through immediate savings or new taxes. You can't say "my house is paid for" when you've just taken out a 10-year loan from the bank to pay off your mortgage. If the unemployment insurance extension had passed, Congress wouldn't have given up the flat screen TV to pay for roof repairs. It would have bought both, and done it with a cash advance on a credit card that is already maxed beyond the ability to pay. Reed's statement may be technically accurate in the world of Washington budgeting. But for the rest of us -- at least those of us who can't print money, who know that 10-year plans can go awry, and who don't think something is paid for until the bill is actually, well, paid -- his statement contains only a small element of truth. We rate it Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-10742	Rudy Giuliani is "probably the most underqualified man since George Bush to seek the presidency."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/06/joe-biden/rudy-has-run-the-nations-largest-city/	During the Oct. 30 Democratic debate, Sen. Joe Biden won the biggest laugh of the night when he said "there's only three things that (Rudy Giuliani) mentions in his sentences — a noun, a verb and 9/11." But the first part of this passage had this doozy: "And the irony is Rudy Giuliani, probably the most underqualified man since George Bush to seek the presidency, is here talking about any of the people here." When the audience laughed, Biden clarified by saying, "I mean this sincerely; he is genuinely not qualified to be president." We talked to historians to assess Biden's statement and see how Giuliani stacks up. (Our detailed look at the candidates' experience can be found in our story here.) Historians like Sean Wilentz, a Princeton history professor who is sharply criticial of George W. Bush, said you can't discount Giuliani's eight years as mayor of New York City. "Experience on the local level doesn't carry much weight in presidential campaigns," Wilentz said. "But it's the city of New York. It's no ordinary city, and that's an advantage he has." Add a crisis like 9/11, where Giuliani was involved in the ground zero rescue effort, and he has experience other candidates don't have, said Stanley Renshon, a political science professor for the City University of New York. "Giuliani got a taste of what it was like to be president," Renshon said. "He was the only person at the epicenter of an attack on American soil." He also has six years as U.S. attorney in New York, where he prosecuted mob figures and Wall Street titans. By contrast, Biden's fellow Democrat John Edwards has only six years of experience in the Senate. Barack Obama has only three in the U.S. Senate and eight in the Illinois Senate. We find Biden's rhetoric is not backed up by the facts because it ignores Giuliani's considerable experience as U.S. attorney and mayor of the nation's largest city.

pomt-01604	Says Michigan U.S. Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land "said guaranteeing equal pay for women who do the same job as men is not a good idea."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/02/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-organization-takes-terri-lynn-lands-com/	Terri Lynn Land, the Republican Senate candidate from Michigan, doesn’t think women should have guaranteed equal pay, says the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The committee recently released an ad attacking Land, who is running against Democratic Rep. Gary Peters in a tight race for Michigan’s open Senate seat. The ad takes clips from one of Land’s own videos -- where she says that as a woman, she knows more about women’s issues than Peters -- and alternates them with claims about Land’s positions on women’s issues. Such as: "Terri Lynn Land said guaranteeing equal pay for women who do the same job as men is not a good idea." We’ve looked into equal pay before, checking the oft-cited claim that women make 77 cents for every dollar men earn. The accuracy of statements about gender and pay depends a lot on how they're phrased. But when speaking of the pay gap overall, it's Mostly True. So we decided to figure out whether Land really said that it’s a bad idea to guarantee equal pay. We found that the DSCC twisted her words. Out of context The claim refers to an interview regarding pay equality that Land gave to the Wall Street Journal back in April, in which she did say the phrase: "I don’t think that’s a good idea." But the ad takes that quote out of context. The Journal asked Land if she would have voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed to pass the Senate that same week. Land -- like others in her party, including Republican women -- said she supports equal pay but not that legislation in particular. The legislation is built off of the Equal Pay Act and would have required employers to prove that pay differences are not gender-based, and it would have prevented employers from punishing employees who inquire or complain about pay concerns. Additionally, employers would have been liable to civil action law suits, which was a concern among Republicans. Land incorrectly told the Journal that her problem with the legislation is that it would require businesses to publicly disclose individuals’ pay. (The law doesn’t have such a provision.) Land has said that existing law already protects equal pay for women; in her platform on women’s issues, she pointed to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Some Republicans have argued that the Paycheck Fairness Act is redundant because discriminatory pay is already illegal. On this year’s Women’s Equality Day -- Aug. 26 -- Land released a statement once again supporting the Equal Pay Act and criticizing Peters for supposedly unequal pay in his own office. This isn’t the first time that Land has had to defend her position on equal pay during this race. In April -- before Land’s interview with the Journal -- American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal political action committee, circulated a 20-second video of Land speaking to a women’s club in 2010. The isolated clip makes it seem that Land believes women aren’t interested in seeking out equal pay. "Well, we all like to be paid more, and that's great. But the reality is that women have a different lifestyle," Land said in the video. "They have kids, they have to take them to get dentist appointments, doctors appointments all those kinds of things, and they're more interested in flexibility in a job than pay." We found a video of the full 30-minute speech and were able to put the short clip in context. She was talking about her experience as a county clerk and union leader in Kent County, Mich., where she noticed that male leaders often negotiated for pay raises. Instead, she chose to negotiate for more job flexibility for her and the female employees she represented (such as making it easier for parents to take time off to care for sick children). Here’s a more representative quote: "About 85 percent of my employees were women. Well, the (union) is a little male organization, have you ever noticed that?" she said. "And of course, they always negotiated for money, for raises. Well, we all like to be paid more and that's great but the reality is that women have a different lifestyle. They have kids, they have to take them to get dentist appointments, doctors appointments all those kinds of things, and they're more interested in flexibility in a job than pay -- although pay is important, too. So we went out and fought those issues for them." Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Congressional Committee said "Terri Lynn Land said guaranteeing equal pay for women who do the same job as men is not a good idea." The ad twisted Land’s words -- she said the Paycheck Fairness Act was "not a good idea," not the general concept of guaranteeing equal pay for women. We can’t read Land’s mind to know whether or not she truly believes in equal pay for women, but as far as we can tell, she never said publicly that it’s a bad idea. We rate this claim Mostly False.

What if you used the savings to pay for upcoming veterinary bills for your dog? Or to pay for your child’s school supplies? What if this still left you deeply in debt? These questions, though hypothetical, apply to the federal government. President Obama announced on Nov. 9 that he was ordering federal departments and agencies to cut wasteful spending on cell phones, promotional plaques and other items by $4 billion. In other words, the federal government was going to save $4 billion a year by cutting out swag. Right? Wrong, said U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Urbana, Ohio. Jordan is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives, and on Nov. 13 he wrote a guest column in USA Today saying that the nation’s $1 trillion annual deficits and $15 trillion debt require actual spending cuts, not illusory ones. His focus was on the then-functioning Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, better known as the "supercommittee," which ultimately failed to unite around tax hikes, spending cuts or any other solution to bring deficits under control. But in making his point, Jordan said: "President Obama's recent plan to cut $100 million of waste within his administration won't actually save money because he's going to spend it elsewhere." This claim intrigued PolitiFact Ohio because of the hoopla surrounding Obama’s announcement on Nov. 9 that federal agencies would be smarter about how they spend money internally. This was the latest step in an ongoing White House "Campaign to Cut Waste," which more broadly includes such steps as cutting Medicare payment errors, selling unneeded federal buildings and using the Internet rather than government printing presses and paper to distribute documents such as the Federal Register, which many people read online. Jordan, too, wants to cut government waste, although his view of government waste is more sweeping than many Democrats’. Still, he said after the recent announcement on cell phones and travel, all the White House was really doing was cutting some areas of spending in order to use the money for other spending. He called it "deficit relocation, not deficit reduction." News reports from the New York Times and USA Today, among others, supported that view. In the words of a USA Today report from Nov. 9, "It turns out President Obama's latest effort to cut government waste isn't forecast to save any money. Instead, federal departments and agencies that take the president up on his mandate to shave 20% from certain categories of spending will be free to use the savings elsewhere." Reported the New York Times: "In fact, the administration said, only a small portion of the $4 billion in annual savings will go toward reducing the deficit. Rather, the money will be spent on other programs, like helping veterans re-enter the work force or improving the nation’s infrastructure, which the White House contends are more worthwhile." The headline on that story was, "Obama cuts $4 billion, then uses it elsewhere." Jordan’s spokeswoman, Meghan Snyder, cited the USA Today story when we asked about her boss’s claim. We noted that the savings were reported as $4 billion, not the $100 million her boss had said, and she said in a return email: "The federal government is on a path toward bankruptcy. In response, the administration wants to move money from one program to another, and call it a 'cut.' Then, to find out the problem is actually 40 times bigger than was previously reported, makes it even worse." But is it really that clear? Obama does intend to cut. He also intends to put the money from the cuts into what he considers higher priorities for the federal government. As USA Today put it, "the estimated savings -- $4 billion -- can be saved but can also be plowed back into more effective programs." So how do you define savings in such a context? We ran this by Eugene Steuerle, a longtime Treasury Department official who was a deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis under President Reagan. Steuerle, a co-founder of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, was not familiar with the fine details of Obama’s waste-cutting plan, but said it sounded as if there could be savings on cell phones (unless it results in $100-an-hour employees wasting their time at a phone booth because their cell phones have been taken away). But that doesn’t mean there will be savings to the federal budget, or a reduction in the number of bonds the government must sell to keep operating. It depends, in other words, on definitions. If you’re throwing money in the ocean and you stop doing that, you are saving money that you used to throw away, Steuerle said. Perhaps you’ll spend it on food, which may be good. But what, he asks, if you spend it on beer? We are tempted to split the baby rather than get totally philosophical. We turned to Webster’s, and the dictionary was somewhat helpful; it defined saving as the act of economizing. In that case, the Obama administration is going to economize, or save -- on cell phones and swag, at least. But in the view of Jordan and many other Republicans, it is not going to use the savings to reduce overall government spending. Instead, it is going to use the cigarette and ocean money for a vacation, for the dog, for food and, in some views, for a little beer. Whether the government spends money well or needs a starvation diet is not the issue here. Jordan’s point was clear, and we do not think he was trying to be cute or clever. He made his statement amid a national and unfinished conversation about taxes, spending and the size of government. But his statement needs clarification, partly because his figure was off -- although that does not affect his overall point -- and also because the concept of saving money can be qualified differently for other purposes. That’s why we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jim Jordan	None	None	None	2011-12-01T06:00:00	2011-11-13	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-00762	A $5-a-night hotel/motel tax that’s part of the transportation bill will hurt Georgia’s convention business by adding extra costs for large groups coming to the state.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/15/michael-t-owens/new-hotel-fee-adds-costs-not-always-guests/	It was clear that everyone would pay a bit more when the Georgia Legislature rammed through a $900 million transportation funding bill that voters and businesses alike said the state needed. State gasoline taxes will increase by almost 35 percent. Electric vehicle drivers, who haven’t been paying for gas, and truckers both will see new annual fees. And if Gov, Nathan Deal signs the measure as expected, it also will add a $5-a-night fee on hotel and motel stays starting July 1. The hospitality industry opposed that last-minute provision. Michael T. Owens, President and CEO of the Tourism Leadership Council in Savannah, told GPB that the charge would have a "serious effect" in that tourist hotspot and statewide. "We absolutely expect to see cancellations of major, major groups," he said. PolitiFact Georgia can’t fact-check predictions. But there is a part of Owens’ comments that calls out for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter: claims that the fee would hurt convention business by adding tens of thousands of dollars in costs for large groups. Georgia does not have a statewide hotel tax. Instead state law allows local governments to levy up to a 3 percent excise tax or up to an 8 percent sales tax. Some of the collections have no limits while others must pay for tourism promotion or specific projects or attractions. Atlanta sets its hotel rate at the maximum 8 percent. Savannah charges 6 percent. The new charge is a flat $5 fee, tacked on for every night of a hotel stay. Owens was out of town when PolitiFact called, but Tourism Leadership Council Vice President Molly Swagler said the group is concerned about an increase to the bottom line of a multi-day stay. "We would typically have a 500-room convention and that adds up to another $2,500 on their bill," Swagler said. "In a larger market like Atlanta, you’ll see 15,000 room nights, so it could be a $75,000 increase out of a $5 fee." Lawmakers did not discuss any of those figures in committee or public, since the fee was added only after a dramatically revised compromise bill. That means the fee was not part of the fiscal note, or official estimate of the effect a bill will have on tax revenues or public spending. Teresa MacCartney, the state’s chief financial officer, released the state Senate’s original fiscal note but said the updated report, with estimates from the bed tax, will not be available until later this week. Senators did request an analysis from the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of West Georgia, that will be part of that updated note. William J. Smith, the university’s economics chair who did the work on the fee, said his research involved collecting information about the average number of hotel rooms and occupancy rate in Georgia, plus the state’s share of tourism visits relative to the rest of the country. That gave an estimate of room nights per year that, multiplied by $5, showed the fee will generate about $160 million a year for transportation projects. In the most basic economics of supply and demand, that tab appears to back up tourism officials’ worry. After all, when prices go up, don’t people buy less? Sometimes. But there are more complex economic realities to that $5 fee. First, even tourism officials agree that the visitors who are set on seeing the historic squares and other Spanish-moss draped sites will still come. Paying $5 more every night could eat into those visitors’ budgets for their stay – costing restaurants and shops business. But there is nothing that says visitors must pay the new fee. Put bluntly, the hotel could eat the cost, if it meant remaining competitive with the likes of, say, Charleston, said Bruce Seaman, an economics professor at Georgia State University who specializes in the impact of projects and attractions. Seaman used 2013 data from the Savannah Area Chamber to see if the city’s hotels would be better off absorbing the cost or increasing the cost to guests. His math included sympathy to the idea that some guests would be sensitive to price changes and stay away. In his scenario, the price change could chase away about 7.5 percent of room nights – costing Savannah-areal hotels about $22.5 million a year. And if the hotels eat the $5 per night themselves? With 3.6 million room nights at a 67 percent occupancy rate, the price tag would be $18.7 million. "The bottom line is, to whatever extent they pass along any of this cost to their customers, they will pay more in a year," Seaman said. "Except, no one is requiring hotels to increase the price paid by customers and in this case, it looks like it would cost them less to eat it than pass it forward." In other words, the overall point from Owens is legitimate. The $5 per-night fee is an increase that will affect business. That is, there are downsides to levying any new tax or fee. But part of that risk can be mitigated by the business eating some of the cost – additional context that shows there is not always a price increase with a new fee. More money is headed to state coffers if the transportation plan becomes reality. But the state is not requiring hotels, which change their rates constantly as a reflection of demand, to raise rates. Considering that caveat, we rate Owens’ statement Mostly True.	None	Michael T. Owens	None	None	None	2015-04-15T00:00:00	2015-04-01	['None']
pomt-05630	According to the Congressional Budget Office, "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/	Republicans marked the two-year anniversary of President Barack Obama’s health care law with statements and video ads attacking the law. RNC chairman Reince Priebus took aim with an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel. Priebus pointed to what he saw as a range of problems with the law, but we zeroed in on one claim. "While millions will be added to the government rolls, millions more will also lose their current health-care coverage," Priebus wrote, later explaining, "According to the (Congressional Budget Office), as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare." Is the health care law really going to leave 20 million American workers without health insurance from their employers? We should note that PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions. However, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others, particularly ones that carry a great deal of credibility, like CBO. So that’s what we’ll do in this case. First, we should explain that the law is being phased in and that only a few provisions have already taken effect. The major elements of the law, which require individuals to obtain coverage and state exchanges for the self-employed and workers from small businesses to get insurance, won’t take effect until 2014. Also, it's important to understand that the CBO and other independent groups project the law will result in new coverage for millions of people who are now uninsured. The numbers vary, but the CBO has projected that the number of uninsured Americans will be 29 million to 31 million lower than it would otherwise be without the law. The law will cause some shifting around of how people get their insurance, and that is at the root of Priebus's point. When we asked the RNC to back up its number, a spokeswoman pointed us to a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office. We often cite CBO’s research because we consider their work to be independent, nonpartisan and credible. We wondered whether Priebus had used CBO’s figure appropriately, and with sufficient context. The CBO study in question was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. It took up this task with care, noting that surveys of what companies may do in the future about health care "have no consequences for the responders, do not require careful analysis or extensive deliberations, and are necessarily based on limited information about the various ways that the (law) will affect the market for health insurance." Still, after taking into account the various cross-cutting factors, CBO came up with a "baseline" estimate -- essentially, its best guess. CBO, along with the similarly nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. While 3 million to 5 million people is nothing to sneeze at, it’s also quite a bit lower than the 20 million figure Priebus cited. So where did the 20 million number come from? CBO supplemented its "baseline" estimate with four alternative scenarios, tweaking its model in a variety of ways to account for the possibility that companies or individuals will behave differently than the baseline estimate assumed. The four alternative scenarios produced a wide range of outcomes. One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million. So Priebus is right that CBO estimated that "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare." But this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered. So Priebus has engaged in cherry-picking. He also ignores some important context. It’s important to note that not everyone who "loses" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to CBO’s "baseline" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans, they are choosing to switch. Priebus also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. After accounting for these other groups, that still leaves about 11 million people "who would have had an offer of employment-based coverage under prior law" who will not have an offer under the new law, CBO says. That’s about 7 percent of the roughly 161 million people projected to have employment-based coverage under prior law, according to CBO. While not as big as the 20 million Priebus cited -- and while it’s partly offset by the 9 million who would gain employer coverage under the law -- this is not a trivial number. Still, it’s important to keep a few bits of context in mind. The people who lose insurance this way won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law. Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will be able to go onto the exchanges and get guaranteed, and in many cases, subsidized coverage. And again, contrary to Priebus's implication, the law is expected to result in a huge gain in the number of people getting coverage. In addition, CBO expects that the employers who drop coverage "will generally have to raise the cash compensation of their employees to compete with employers who continue to offer health insurance." It’s unclear whether they will raise wages and salaries by enough to compensate for the lost insurance, but it’s still worth remembering that any change will likely be something of a trade-off for the employee in question -- no more employer insurance, but more cash compensation. Finally, a number of other estimates by groups other than CBO tend to track with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Priebus’ figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. Our ruling Priebus’ number does appear in the CBO report he references in the op-ed, but it’s not the primary estimate -- it’s one of four alternative scenarios, and easily the one with the biggest decrease. So the number is cherry-picked. His claim also suggests that 20 million people are being forced out of the coverage, when in fact many will choose voluntarily to switch to better coverage. And he conveniently ignores the estimates that 9 million people who didn't have employer coverage will get it because of the law, at least according to CBO’s estimates. His claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, which is our definition of Half True.

pomt-03433	A study of private bail bond systems "showed that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states" of defendants skipping court appearances.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/24/robin-vos/vos-says-study-shows-defendants-skip-court-appeara/	Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) says his support for a private bail system and bounty hunters in Wisconsin is a fiscal matter. The whole point of bond, Vos told a group of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors June 10, 2013, is to guarantee that defendants show up for court. "Anything that increases the ability of people to show up for court is a good thing because a smaller number of no-shows means more effective and efficient courts and hopefully a smaller cost for taxpayers," he said. Vos added: "There was a study done by WPRI that showed that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states. We’re one of only two or four states that doesn’t have bail bonds right now." With Vos and his Republican colleagues in charge of the Legislature, their move to include a private bail measure in the state budget made its enactment a strong possibility. As it stands, only Wisconsin, Illinois, Oregon and Kentucky bar private bail. Gov. Scott Walker vetoed a broader provision in 2011, but Vos has narrowed the plan this time to a five-county experiment (Dane, Kenosha, Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha) of the type Walker signalled he could support. Under the proposed system, defendants would pay a bail agent 10 percent of the full bail amount. The company must pay 3 percent of the bail amount to the court. If the defendant fails to appear in court, the bonding company is liable for the full amount. But a bail agent usually has an opportunity to recover a no-show defendant -- often using bounty hunters. Bail companies say their work needs no taxpayer funding and enhances public safety by lowering the number of no-shows. Critics say it’s an unfair monetary burden on lower-income people and that elected judges should have primary say over who is held or walks free before trial. With that in mind, we wondered if Vos was on the mark claiming a study shows that Wisconsin court defendants fail to appear more often than in other states. Digging deeper Vos cited a March 2013 report ("Should Wisconsin Allow Commercial Bail in Pretrial Release?) by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute (WPRI), a conservative think-tank based in Hartland. For the report, which reviewed various studies on bail, the group hired Kate Lind, a Madison lawyer who is Walker’s campaign treasurer and was controller for the state Republican Party. She runs a political consulting firm that helps Republicans comply with campaign finance laws. Lind did an earlier study for WPRI on probation and parole. Her report concluded that bringing private bail back to Wisconsin, if integrated with pretrial assessments and services, would create a "valuable option to prevent failure to appear while protecting the financial and public safety interests of Wisconsin." We read Lind’s report and found no state-by-state comparisons of no-show rates, and no data for Wisconsin’s statewide no-show rate. Lind confirmed she never found any statistics showing that Wisconsin lags behind other states and that it’s probably impossible to do such a comparison due to the lack of data here and elsewhere. Criminal courts typically are county-based, so statewide figures are elusive. Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer agreed the study does not make the case on Wisconsin versus other states. Beyer said Vos believes you can infer a disadvantage for Wisconsin because government and academic studies of data from large U.S. counties (including Milwaukee County) have found a lower no-show rate on private bail bonds than on personal-recognizance bonds or most other forms of non-financial release. Those studies have limitations but do show that disparity, as we reported in rating False a claim by Democratic state Sen. Lena Taylor of Milwaukee that "no statistical evidence" exists that bail bonds increase the likelihood that defendants appear for scheduled hearings. Most significantly for evaluating Vos’ claim, those studies are not statewide and rely on data from 1998 and earlier in Milwaukee County, where judges say a 2012 internal study found their felony no-show rate is 16 percent. That is below the national average for large counties cited in various studies. Milwaukee County uses a system of methodically assessing criminal defendants’ risk of flight, and judges there say that would protect public safety better than a commercial bail system. Our rating Vos said a study of private bail bond systems "showed that Wisconsin has a higher no-show rate than other states" of defendants skipping court appearances. The study doesn’t compare states, and doesn’t include a Wisconsin figure. And while various studies of local municipalities show lower no-show rates for private bail and therefore suggest the same advantage would hold for Wisconsin, Vos spoke as if the question is settled. We rate his claim False.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2013-06-24T14:37:36	2013-06-10	['Wisconsin']
pomt-00227	Says Minnesota congressional candidate Jim Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away health care for 340,000 veterans, with 17,000 in Minnesota possibly losing coverage.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/votevetsorg/veterans-group-says-jim-hagedorns-health-care-posi/	Like apple pie, some things are so sacred in American society that you mess with them at your peril. Senior citizens, for one. Veterans, for another. So look out, Jim Hagedorn, because a veterans’ political group says you’d do some messing if elected. Hagedorn is a Republican in southern Minnesota running for the seat held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Walz, who decided to run for the state’s governorship rather than seek reelection in its 1st Congressional District. VoteVets, a liberal-leaning group, says Hagedorn’s support for past congressional Republican health care proposals shows he backs "a plan that rewards special interests while taking away health care for 340,000 veterans." That’s a national number, but in Minnesota alone, "17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage," VoteVets says in an ad. "That’s a disgrace," says the announcer, who calls Hagedorn "not fit to serve in Congress." PolitiFact was unaware of any plan to cancel health coverage for veterans, but it sounded outrageous so we asked VoteVets, which explained its case. We also spoke with Hagedorn, who said the criticism shows ignorance of his and other Republicans’ ideas. We’ll explain. Veterans care The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs operates a nationwide system of hospitals and health centers. But "contrary to claims concerning promises of ‘free health care for life,’ not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the VA," said a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 that explained which veterans get care. "Eligibility for VA health care is based primarily on veteran status resulting from military service." VA has "priority groups," which factor in such things as service-connected disabilities, prisoner of war status, Purple Heart or Medal of Honor honorees, and income. That leaves a lot of other veterans to get care from their employers, to buy it on their own or, if their incomes are low enough, to qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state program. As a result, about 1.75 million veterans across the country are on Medicaid, says Families USA, a liberal group supporting broad health care eligibility. Paying for Medicaid Medicaid enrollment used to be limited to people with extremely low incomes -- the median state cap was 61 percent below the federal poverty level -- and it was difficult for childless, working-wage men to enroll because of other participation limits. The Affordable Care Act raised the income-eligibility level to 138 percent of poverty, or $16,753 for an individual today, and broadened the enrollment guidelines. But states had to agree to participate, because states have to pay a share of the costs. Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia ultimately decided to participate in this expansion and three more are considering it, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data as of Sept. 11, 2018. The federal share of money to pay for this new group of enrollees started at 100 percent but phases down to 90 percent by the year 2020, with states paying the rest. That’s a lot higher than the 57 percent, on average, that Washington paid for pre-expansion enrollees. About 340,000 veterans nationwide gained health coverage through this Medicaid expansion, a Families USA analysis said in May 2017. Counting all people enrolled in Medicaid, not just those in the expansion pool, 17,000 veterans in Minnesota get their health care paid for through the program, Families USA said. Proposed cuts Republicans in Congress never liked Obamacare. They have tried ever since its passage in 2010 to repeal the law and, more recently, to replace certain parts. One idea popular among many Republicans in 2017 was to turn more authority over to states. But the funding formulas would change. A Republican House bill that passed on a partisan basis, the American Health Care Act of 2017, would have rolled back the "enhanced federal matching rate" of payments for Medicaid expansion starting in 2020, taking it from 90 percent to an average of 57 percent, with some fluctuation by state. States could still get the 90 percent federal match for any expansion enrollees still in the program at the time of the changeover. The House bill would also slow future Medicaid spending in general. A Senate bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, would have set a per-person cap for Medicaid spending, limited the program’s funding growth and cut the federal share for expanded Medicaid to 57 percent on average by 2024. Lacking votes to advance, in part because some conservatives were not satisfied it adequately curbed the government’s role, the Senate bill died. Hagedorn’s tie-in These bills and similar ideas form the basis of the VoteVets claim. Hagedorn supported both bills in principle. Analysis by health policy analysts and the Congressional Budget Office said the current enrollees in Medicaid’s expansion would ultimately be dropped from enrollment. Among the reasons: People cycle on and off the Medicaid rolls as their incomes and circumstances change. That means that while the 90 percent federal funding match would have remained for continuous enrollment, fewer than one-third of these people would still be enrolled two years later, the Congressional Budget Office said in an analysis of the House bill, and 95 percent of them would be gone by the end of 2024. Once they left, states would lack the federal dollars to re-enroll them, health policy analysts said at the time. The other cuts and spending caps would add to this pressure. States would be faced with higher costs in general. Put all this together and, VoteVets and Families USA said, this could lead to the death of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. Some states "would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped," the Congressional Budget Office said in its March 2017 analysis of the House bill. As a result, there would be 14 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026, a reduction of about 17 percent, the CBO said. The numbers were different, but not by much, in the CBO’s analysis of the Senate bill. "By 2026, among people under age 65, enrollment in Medicaid" -- all Medicaid, not just the ACA expansion pool -- "would fall by about 16 percent," the nonpartisan analysts said. All Medicaid spending would be about 35 percent lower in 2036 compared with spending under the current trajectory, the CBO said. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a liberal group, but health policy analysts last year agreed with a conclusion it made in its own report: The cost shifts would require states "to come up with tens of billions more in annual funding from their own budgets in order to maintain their expansions. In practice, states very likely wouldn’t be able to absorb these additional costs." No Grinch here Hagedorn told us in a telephone interview that VoteVets’ criticism was based entirely on speculation. "It’s all ‘could, would, maybe,’" he said. While true that states would have to make decisions, "I’m sure we would do the right thing" in Minnesota to make sure veterans were covered. Furthermore, he said, he would want to pass legislation in Congress to open the VA system to all veterans, and let them decide whether to get care at a VA center or from private doctors and hospitals. Hagedorn has a number of his positions on his campaign website, including giving "block grant funding and authority of the Medicaid program to the states." Finally, you might be wondering: Why on earth would congressional Republicans want to take away people’s health care? House and Senate Republicans said they didn’t and wouldn’t. Although their bills would roll back Medicaid, people losing Medicaid would qualify instead for subsidies with which to buy insurance -- even people with incomes below the poverty line, unlike the Obamacare subsidy system. Their form of insurance might change from Medicaid to an insurance carrier (with subsidies to pay premiums), but they’d still be able to get coverage. But the CBO and Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation said this would be inadequate for many. The GOP bills would let insurers cover fewer illnesses and conditions than under Obamacare, so people with some illnesses would have to pay more for care. Regardless of their coverages, the policies would require more out-of-pocket costs, whereas now, "the vast majority of people enrolled in Medicaid pay no premiums and have either no out-of-pocket costs or nominal amounts of such costs," the CBO said in its analysis of the Senate bill. Because of "the expense for premiums and the high deductibles," most people losing Medicaid "would not purchase insurance," the CBO said. Our ruling VoteVets said Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away "health care for 340,000 veterans. In Minnesota alone, 17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage." Hagedorn says that’s not true, in part because of his proposal for broader VA enrollment. It’s an interesting idea, but not on the verge of congressional consideration. Yet the Medicaid cuts have been on the verge of consideration -- and even got House approval -- for some time. PolitiFact examined a number of claims around last year’s discussions. When White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the House plan "doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion," PolitiFact called it Mostly False, explaining that with reduced federal funding, states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. When Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said "nobody on Medicaid" would have benefits taken away, we ruled it False for similar reasons. And when the Senate considered the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, PolitiFact said a claim by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida -- that "there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid" -- was Mostly False. There were other claims, and you can read them here. VoteVets used two specific numbers in its claim. The first number, 340,000, is a nationwide figure for veterans in the Medicaid expansion pool. There is no way to know if every one of them would lose coverage. As for the 17,000 figure in the ad, it includes all veterans on Medicaid in Minnesota, not just those in the expansion pool. The claim is based on analyses, and things might turn out differently, especially if states stepped up, as Hagedorn expects. As such, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01260	Loretta Lynch, the new nominee for attorney general, "was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/10/breitbart/breitbart-gets-wrong-loretta-lynch-whitewater-clai/	President Barack Obama made some political news over the weekend, nominating federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. The announcement sent news staffs scrambling to better understand Lynch’s political views and to better understood the likelihood that she’ll be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Conservative news website Breitbart.com unearthed a potentially controversial line in Lynch’s biography. "Obama’s new attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch represented Clintons during Whitewater," read a headline from Breitbart’s Warner Todd Houston. Houston wrote: There is just one problem. Breitbart got the wrong Loretta Lynch. The mistake was first noted by liberal journalists at Media Matters. Breitbart eventually acknowledged in a correction that they got the wrong Lynch, but left the story up anyway. Later, Breitbart deleted the story, though it had already spread to other conspiracy, opinion and conservative news websites like WND, Sodahead.com and the American Thinker. In this case, the Truth-O-Meter doesn’t have to work too hard to come up with a rating, but we think it’s important to address anyway because of how quickly false information spreads around the Internet. The Loretta Lynch nominated to replace Holder began working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in 1990, so she couldn’t have been part of Clinton’s defense a few years later. According to her official biography, Lynch was appointed by Obama on May 3, 2010, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, an office she previously led from 1999 to 2001. The other Loretta Lynch got a law degree from Yale and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton’s, according to her biography. This Loretta Lynch served as president of the California Public Utilities Commission from 2000-02 and as a commissioner until 2005. We captured this image of her from her last appearance on C-SPAN, when she was addressing senators in 2002 about an alleged scheme by Enron to manipulate energy prices in California. Our ruling An article on Breitbart that has since been deleted said Loretta Lynch, Obama’s new nominee for attorney general, "was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe." The conservative news website got the wrong Loretta Lynch. We’re hoping the correction spreads as fast as the original story. This claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-10639	"John doesn't have a record in the Senate. John's only passed four bills. They're all about post offices."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/07/joe-biden/edwards-a-significant-player-on-several-bills/	Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. About John Edwards, he said, "John doesn't have a record in the Senate. John's only passed four bills. They're all about post offices." Edwards was similarly depicted as inexperienced by Democratic primary opponents and President Bush's re-election campaign during the 2004 presidential race. But as a freshman senator, he worked with senior Democrats like Edward M. Kennedy to see that his views on public school accountability, border security, bioterrorism and other issues were incorporated into bills moving toward enactment. Edwards took a lead role enacting a law that authorized federal grants for local agencies and nonprofits to find missing adults. It was named "Kristen's Law" after Kristen Modafferi, a North Carolina State University student who disappeared in 1997, shortly after her 18th birthday. He collaborated with Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to enact a law to combat deceptive sweepstakes notices. And in his third year, Edwards was active in the 2001 debate over President Bush's bid to revamp federal education policy, which put an emphasis on annual testing and created consequences for schools with chronically low test scores. Edwards authored a provision in the final version of a landmark education bill that established "support teams" to help turn around failing schools. In the wake of the Enron corporate governance scandal, Edwards wrote language in a law regulating the accounting industry that requires attorneys to report corporate wrongdoing to a company's officers or, if necessary, to its directors. And three days after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Edwards introduced legislation aimed at strengthening security at airports and seaports. Elements of the plan were eventually incorporated into aviation security and port security laws, including requirements for strengthened cockpit doors and the establishment of special port security units within the Coast Guard. Edwards also took a prominent role in an important health care debate, joining with John McCain and Kennedy in 2001 to unveil a plan that would give patients more leverage over their managed-care health insurance plans. The plan, which promised new patient protections and liability caps for employers, passed the Senate 59-36 that summer but then stalled over the question of whether patients could sue their health plans. Congress' attention shifted to national security following the Sept. 11 attacks, and the measure was not revived. "You can't hold it against him that his bills don't pass as they flow from his pen," former Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in assessing Edwards' record after he was tapped to be John Kerry's running mate in 2004. "Major bills come from committee chairmen and occasionally ranking members. . . . If a younger member has an idea, those ideas are often incorporated into a larger bill in committee." As for less significant legislation, Edwards, like many members of Congress, sponsored several bills authorizing the naming of post offices in his home state, as Biden correctly states. He also drafted a 2001 Senate resolution honoring Dale Earnhardt after the NASCAR driver was killed in a crash. But because Edwards successfully injected himself into a number of significant debates and shaped their outcomes — often while serving in the minority party — we rule this Biden statement False.

pomt-06767	"Hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/21/gary-schaer/assemblyman-gary-schaer-claims-hair-stylists-face-/	Sit down for a hair cut and you quickly see it: a document telling you this stylist or barber is licensed by the State of New Jersey. Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic) said the state should also be in the business of regulating foreclosure consultants, those who try to help people save their homes. Following a recent court ruling allowing four banks to resume uncontested residential mortgage foreclosures in state court, Schaer issued a press release on Aug. 17 calling on Gov. Chris Christie to sign a bill aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure rescue scams. Foreclosure consultants could charge homeowners with the promise of helping them avoid or postpone foreclosure. In some cases, clients could end up turning over their homes, paying rent to live there and then getting evicted. "New Jersey continues to be the ‘Wild West’ of foreclosure consulting," Schaer, one of the bill’s sponsors, said in the press release. "Hair stylists are required to undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants." Could hair stylists really face more government requirements than foreclosure consultants? PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Schaer’s claim was accurate. Hair stylists must receive a license and follow other regulations, while Schaer’s bill would actually outline the first regulations for so-called "foreclosure consultants." However, individuals providing such consulting services as "debt adjusters" face state regulations, and a new federal law already imposes requirements similar to those under Schaer’s bill. First, let’s talk about the regulatory environment faced by hair stylists. According to 23 pages of state regulations, hairstyling and other related positions require a license from the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling. Hair stylists and barbers must complete an educational course, and pass an exam conducted by the board. By contrast, there are no state regulations for "foreclosure consultants," because the term doesn’t exist under state law, according to Marshall McKnight, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Banking & Insurance. The bill sponsored by Schaer would define that term and lay out the new regulations, McKnight said. Under the bill, known as the "Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Prevention Act," the new requirements for foreclosure consultants would include securing a license from the Commissioner of Banking & Insurance and undergoing a criminal background check. "People are being scammed on a constant basis," Schaer said in a phone interview. "There’s no oversight at all." But most of the foreclosure consultants’ activities listed in the bill are covered by the state’s Debt Adjuster Act, which requires "debt adjusters" to be licensed to act as intermediaries between a debtor and his creditors. In essence, debt adjusters can perform a type of foreclosure consulting, but they must be licensed -- just like hair stylists. In 2008, state officials issued warnings about individuals or entities advertising or performing foreclosure consulting and other services. Those warnings indicated that providing such services requires a debt adjuster’s license. Peggy Jurow, a senior attorney with the Anti-Predatory Lending Project at Legal Services of New Jersey, said foreclosure consultants are subject to the state’s Consumer Fraud Act, but otherwise, they’re not regulated. So, Schaer’s bill marks new territory in regulating "foreclosure consultants." Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the governor has until Thursday to take action on the legislation, which was passed unanimously by the Legislature on June 29. "As with all pieces of pending legislation, it is receiving the careful review of our counsel’s office prior to the Governor taking action," Roberts said in an email. Now, even though Schaer’s statement refers to state regulations, let’s take a quick look at how federal law regulates foreclosure rescue services. Federal regulations don’t require licensing or background checks for foreclosure rescue consultants, but a new law from the Federal Trade Commission mandates requirements similar to those under Schaer’s bill. Called the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services (MARS) Rule, that law prohibits foreclosure rescue service providers from receiving fees until homeowners get a written offer from their lenders. All of the rule’s provisions were in effect as of Jan. 31. The ruling Schaer claimed hair stylists must "undergo more government scrutiny than foreclosure consultants." He’s right, because there are no existing state regulations governing foreclosure consultants. That term and the regulations would come from Schaer’s bill. Foreclosure consulting done by "debt adjusters" requires a state license, but since Schaer’s statement was in reference to "foreclosure consultants," we rate the statement True.

pomt-06340	"Today 46 percent of all Floridians owe more on their home than it is worth."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/nov/08/rod-smith/rod-smith-says-46-percent-florida-mortgages-are-un/	Republicans have ruled the trifecta of state government -- the House, Senate and governor's office -- since the election of Gov. Jeb Bush in 1998. So what happens when a host of essentially locked-out Democrats come together for a rally amid the worst recession since the Great Depression? A whole lot of blame-tossing against the party in charge. Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith, a former prosecutor who lost his 2006 gubernatorial bid to Charlie Crist, roasted Republicans in his speech at the party's state convention on Oct. 29, 2011, for being out of touch with middle-class Americans, the St. Petersburg Times reported. He used the housing crisis as an example. "Think about it. When Republicans took over the leadership of Florida, most of you had never even heard the term 'underwater mortgage,'" Smith said. "Today 46 percent of all Floridians owe more on their home than it is worth. "It is in a moment of crisis like we are (in) that a political party can revive itself, reinvent itself into a force that can re-center this nation, this state," he said. "Unlike the Republicans, we don't have some undying sworn oath that says we will keep supporting the same predatory practices that got us into this mess to start with. We're the only party situated where we can reach out and lead the entire nation." We hear all the time about Florida's foreclosure problems and unemployment (10.6 percent in September). But Smith's figure for the number of underwater mortgages in this state is striking. Do nearly half of Floridians really owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth? Being underwater means a home owner owes more on their mortgage than the home is worth, and it's happened to many home owners since Florida's housing bubble went bust. Borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth sometimes opt to leave their homes and let the properties enter foreclosure. These "strategic defaults" contribute to foreclosures already clogging the courts, leading to even lower home prices. We already know from this fact-check that the national percentage of underwater homes is around 22 and 27 percent, depending upon which real estate data-mining company you ask. If Smith is right, Florida's figure would be almost twice the national average. We circled back to CoreLogic Inc. and Zillow.com, companies that analyze real estate data using county public records. CoreLogic's most recent report, spanning April to June 2011, found Florida's rate of underwater homes was third-highest in the country at 45.1 percent, trailing Nevada at 60 percent and Arizona at 49 percent. The next-highest state is Michigan at 36 percent. By CoreLogic's tally, the number of underwater homes in Florida as of June was about 1.97 million. Zillow.com typically does not typically measure states' overall rate of underwater homes, said spokeswoman Alison Paoli. The company did, however, have underwater data for Florida's metropolitan areas through the end of the third quarter ending in September. The breakdown gives us some perspective about the places in Florida most plagued by sinking home values. Metro areas with the highest rate of underwater homes include Jacksonville (59.8 percent), Port St. Lucie (57.8 percent), Melbourne (54.8 percent) and Sarasota (51 percent). (Information for Orlando is not available). The lowest-rate places? Those include Panama City (37.4 percent) and Gainesville (39.8 percent). Our ruling Rod Smith claimed that nearly half, or 46 percent, of Floridians owe more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. The most recent rate of underwater homes in Florida is 45.1 percent, behind only Nevada and Arizona. And that estimate is actually pretty conservative compared to what several metro areas are experiencing. Given the implications for our housing market, we suspect most Floridians are sorry that his claim checks out. What's not so clear is Smith's suggestion that Florida Republicans are somehow responsible for the ailing housing market. While he doesn't explicitly blame Republicans for causing the housing bust, he does suggest it, and that's enough for us to downgrade his rating. The housing bubble was a national phenomenon, at the heart of which were national lenders, and other states are feeling our pain. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-15028	"We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/04/mark-kelly/out-date-gun-background-check-statistic-gets-new-l/	As the country grapples with Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college, a retired astronaut whose wife survived a killing spree four years ago is leading the charge for stricter gun control. Mark Kelly is married to former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was severely injured in a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson that left 10 others dead. Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control. "One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check," Kelly said during CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 4. "That means felons, people who are dangerously mentally ill have easy access to guns." The 40 percent figure was often invoked by gun control advocates who wanted stricter background check laws after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school mass shooting. We and other fact-checkers have pointed out that it’s based on outdated research. We wanted to know if there had been any updates that would give this statistic more weight. The 21-year-old statistic, recently reproduced in an unpublished survey, is still the best figure available, experts told us, thanks to a two-decade ban on federal funding of gun violence research. Virtually all iterations of the 40 percent claim can be traced to a 1994 survey by Duke University’s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago’s Jens Ludwig. Kelly’s source is a 2013 white paper that cites Cook and Ludwig’s survey as its source, according to a spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions. The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases, was enacted. There’s debate among researchers on whether the 40 percent figure still holds true today, and Cook and Ludwig have both said that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check. Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of The Politics of Gun Control, noted that the background check statistic is "notoriously slippery," because gun sales that don’t go through a federally licensed seller are, as you would expect, not subject to formal record keeping. "How would a researcher identify a sufficiently large and representative sample of non-background check gun purchases/exchanges, given the absence of a paper trail?" Spitzer said. "My general sense is that 40 percent might be on the high side but is certainly possible." Nevertheless, it’s the best estimate we have, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, adding, "There's no good reason to believe that the number has changed substantially — though we can't know for sure." Ludwig told PolitiFact that he can see why people use the 1994 survey as the benchmark, "even though everyone recognizes the estimate is now old." So why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old? There’s very little funding for research on gun violence. Problems with methodology also play a role, but the 1996 appropriations bill, experts said, is mainly to blame for the lack of research dollars. Strong-armed by the powerful gun lobby, Congress wrote in a provision that effectively banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching the roots of gun violence. "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control," the bill reads. "It basically was a shot across the bow by Congress on the part of the NRA," Mark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Control and Prevention, told the Washington Post. "All federally funded research was shut down." As a result of the attack on CDC funding, all government funding for the issue was stifled, agreed David Hemenway, director of Harvard University’s Injury Control Research Center. Private foundations, too, were wary of putting dollars toward a controversial and politically divisive topic, he said. (There are fewer than five foundations providing the funding today, said Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, to Slate.) Just a few years ago, it looked like things were about to change for gun violence research. In the wake of the Newtown shooting in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation directing the CDC and other federal agencies to look into the causes of gun violence. In spite of the presidential pressure, the 20-year moratorium on gun violence research wasn’t really lifted, and researchers haven’t exactly heeded Obama’s call. Six days after the Charleston, S.C., church shooting on June 17, 2015, House Republicans blocked an amendment that would have funded CDC gun violence research in the next fiscal year. Instead, the appropriations bill "continues the general provision to prevent any funds provided from being spent on gun research." Advocates of the funding ban say the research is inherently biased to support stricter gun control and is irrelevant to the mission of the CDC. In the words of outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, "a gun is not a disease." Hemenway has managed to get around the lack of federal and private funding for gun research with a recent project financed by the Fund for a Safer Future, a program aimed at reducing gun violence. He told PolitiFact that the Harvard Injury Control Research Center conducted a 2015 national survey with a sample size over 3,000 that confirmed the 40 percent of sales without a background check figure. However, this study has not been published, and we could not read it for ourselves, so we cannot factor it into this fact-check. Our ruling Kelly said, "We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check." The figure he’s citing comes from a 21-year-old survey with a small sample size before a key gun law took effect. Even its authors say they’re not sure if it holds true today. Still, there are few credible alternative statistics because of a two-decade dearth of gun violence research funding. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Mark Kelly	None	None	None	2015-10-04T18:36:20	2015-10-04	['None']
pomt-04129	"Eleven states complete their [legislative] sessions within three calendar months, and another five only meet biennially."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/08/kenneth-block/kenneth-block-chairman-rhode-islands-moderate-part/	When it comes to legislative sessions, Kenneth Block, chairman of Rhode Island’s Moderate Party, says shorter is better. In the November 2012 elections, 15 of the 38 state Senate seats and 33 of 75 House races were uncontested. Block says he thinks that’s partly because the General Assembly session can last six months, a time commitment that most working Rhode Islanders can’t make and still keep their paying jobs. In a commentary that appeared in The Providence Journal on Dec. 16, 2012, he said the Ocean State should take a lesson from the 11 states that are obligated, usually by their state constitutions, to finish their sessions within 90 days. Or the five other states that meet every other year. "The business of the General Assembly can and should be carried out in three calendar months," Block wrote. "This would make public service in the General Assembly more accessible to a great many more Rhode Islanders - and would bring a far wider diversity of life experiences into the legislature." We decided to see if Block’s tally of legislatures with shorter terms was right. But first, a little background on Rhode Island’s legislature. Article VI, Section 3 of the the Rhode Island Constitution requires the General Assembly to open its annual session on the first Tuesday in January but puts no time limit on how many days the Assembly can be in session. The Assembly usually meets from January to June, generally three days a week, starting at about 4 p.m. By the time adjournment rolls around, the House has usually met a day or two more than the Senate. Legislators usually try to adjourn as early in June as they can. Last year’s session ran through June 12 and took 64 legislative days, according to a review of the daily journals on the legislature’s website. In the early 2000s there were years when the legislature was in session for 70 days or more, and went into July. When we asked Block about his figures on other legislative sessions, he said his source was the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group with offices in Washington, D.C., and Denver, that provides research and policy advice to state legislatures across the country. On their website, we found a conference survey of the 50 states showing that 11 did in fact have constitutional requirements that their legislatures meet for no more than 90 calendar days. Five others meet just once every two years, for varying lengths of time. Block argues shorter sessions would encourage more working people to consider running for legislative office. Setting a specific date or number of days would force the legislature to compress its work, he said. But there is something else to consider. Larry Berman, director of communications for the state House of Representatives, said Block’s focus on the January-to-June timeline is misleading because the legislature usually only meets three days a week. Other states hit those 90-day limits by meeting four or five days a week. If the Rhode Island General Assembly met five days a week, and if it worked through the week off it usually takes in February, it could finish a 64-day session in the last week of March -- in other words, three calendar months. Berman said that, with the legislature meeting three days a week, and starting at 4 p.m. instead of 9 or 10 a.m., it’s easier for people with day jobs to serve. Our ruling Ken Block said that "Eleven states complete their [legislative] sessions within three calendar months, and another five only meet biennially." He argues that shorter sessions could encourage more participation. By the calendar, counting months, Block is right. Eleven other state legislatures finish weeks before Rhode Island’s usual June adjournment. But when you count the number of days the Rhode Island General Assembly is in session, Rhode Island legislators actually work fewer days than their counterparts in some of those 90-day states. We find the statement is "accurate but needs clarification or additional information," our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-12351	"While (women) represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/12/ivanka-trump/ivanka-trump-target-figures-women-stem-fields/	During an interview on Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed the challenges facing women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math -- collectively known as STEM. It was one of the themes of her recent book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success. In a discussion with the hosts about the nation’s employment picture, Trump raised the issue of where future jobs will be coming from. "A lot of them are in STEM-related fields -- science, engineering, computer science," she said during the June 12, 2017, segment. "Women, for example, while we represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations." When we looked into this statistic, we found that it’s not far off the mark. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Trump was correct about the percentage of the overall workforce that is female -- average Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 2016 finds precisely that figure, 47 percent. As for STEM employment, the most recent comprehensive data we could find was in a report published in 2016 by the National Science Board and the National Science Foundation, using 2013 statistics. The report found that in 2013, women represented 29 percent of individuals in science and engineering occupations. That’s higher than Trump’s 23 percent, although it supports her broader point -- that women are underrepresented in STEM fields. And if you recalculate the raw data in the report, you can get a few percentage points closer to Trump’s figure. In coming up with the 29 percent figure, the report counted jobs in the social sciences. Some may not think that such fields as political science and sociology are core STEM professions, so we ran the numbers without that subcategory. This meant removing a sector -- social sciences -- that is 62 percent women. The remaining fields -- which include mathematics, computer science, life sciences, chemistry, physics, geology and engineering -- are just over 25 percent female. That’s closer to Trump’s figure, but still a little high. It’s also worth noting that there is wide variation in the percentage of women from STEM field to STEM field. (Trump was referring to average figures, so we won’t lower her rating for this part of the equation.) For instance, in "biological, agricultural, and environmental life scientists," there is almost gender parity, with 48 percent female, 52 percent male. In the field of non-practicing medical research, women actually have a majority of the positions, at 56 percent. By contrast, engineering as a whole is only 15 percent female. The percentages are even lower in certain specialties, such as aeronautical engineering (12 percent female), petroleum engineering (10 percent) and mechanical engineering (8 percent). When we ran our calculations by the National Girls Collaborative Project, a nonprofit group that specializes in increasing the number of girls and women in STEM fields, Erin Hogeboom, the group's community development and network strategy manager, said our analysis mirrors theirs. "Women’s representation in STEM fields is distressingly lower than it should be, and the best way to support the argument for the need to change this is through accurate data," Hogeboom said. Our ruling Ivanka Trump said, "While (women) represent 47 percent of the overall work force, we only make up 23 percent of STEM-related occupations." She’s right on the first figure, and she’s close on the second, according to the most recent comprehensive data. But because she’s a few percentage points off on the latter figure, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-13406	Says Israel profiles based on ethnicity and "does it very successfully."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-claim-israel-profiling-very-successfu/	In the wake of two bombings in New York, Donald Trump repeated his call for profiling as a way to deter terrorism, citing Israel as a role model. Trump first made the proposal on CBS’ Face the Nation in June 2016, in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando. He suggested it again in two Sept. 19 interviews on Fox News. "Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. They’ll profile. They see somebody suspicious. They will profile," Trump said on Fox and Friends that morning, adding. "If somebody looks like he’s got a massive bomb on his back, we won’t go to that person and say, ‘I’m sorry’ — because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world. We’re not allowed to profile. Give me a break." "Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully," Trump said to Fox’s Bill O’Reilly that night. "I am saying, you go in to profile people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims." The Trump campaign told us Trump did not say ethnic or racial profiling, but this denial is misleading. Trump said "we have no choice" when O’Reilly asked him how profiling "Arab or Muslim men" would work. Israel does perform different types of profiling, but they have other security measures in place as well that experts say are crucial to their success in deterring terrorism. And, the two countries’ security infrastructure are strikingly different. Profiling in Israel Israel practices both predictive profiling and ethnic profiling. The former looks for red flags and suspicious behavior (i.e. arriving for an international flight with no bags) while the latter targets populations seen as more likely to pose risks (i.e. Arab and Muslim men). Amotz Brandes is a former intelligence officer in the Israeli Defense Forces and a security agent and profiler at El Al Airlines, Israel’s flagship carrier. He is now a managing partner at the international security firm, Chameleon Associates. Brandes told PolitiFact that Israeli security almost exclusively profiled Arabs and Muslims until the Lod Airport massacre of 1972. That year, a radical Palestinian group recruited gumen from the militant Japanese Red Army for the terrorist attack that killed 26 people at the airport in Tel Aviv. Using non-Arab, non-Muslim gunmen exploited and exposed a weakness in exclusively focusing on someone’s race or ethnicity, Brandes said. Israeli security now consider a much more comprehensive and specific set of indicators to locate potential threats. But Israel "never really stopped risk-based profiling. They just added threat-based profiling," Brandes said, adding for a Jewish state located in a "very unsafe neighborhood," it’s necessary. "They treat those with Arab ethnicity as higher risk. It’s not a secret. It’s done in many, many ways." For example, Ben Gurion International Airport (formerly Lod Airport) labels passengers with numbered stickers, one representing low risk and six very high risk. All fliers are questioned and searched, but those with higher numbers undergo more intensive security screening. According to Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky, one’s, two’s and three’s are reserved for Jewish Israelis, Jewish non-Israelis and friendly internationals. Arab Israelis and questionable internationals are given a four or higher. Palestinians and Muslims are typically classified as six. The Arab American Institute has documented numerous cases of detentions of Arabs and Muslims lasting upward of 10 hours. In 2014, Ben Gurion installed an automated system for checking bags that some say has improved access for Arab and Muslim passengers. This prompted the Israeli High Court to toss out a lawsuit from the Association of Civil Rights in Israel over ethnic profiling, a decision that the human rights group says didn’t result in the actual prohibition of discrimination. The U.S. State Department’s country profile for Israel warns that Palestinian-Americans and "U.S. citizens of Arab or Muslim heritage have experienced significant difficulties and unequal and hostile treatment at Israel’s borders and checkpoints." The efficacy of ethnic profiling Whether ethnic profiling is actually productive to counterterrorism is a debated question. "I think it is fair to say that the jury is out and that it would be incorrect to suggest that profiling has been successful in deterring terrorism," said Bernard Harcourt, a law and political professor at Columbia University who specializes in penal law and security. In a much-cited 2006 paper, Harcourt found no empirical evidence that racial or ethnic profiling is an effective measure. (Similarly, William Press, a computer scientists at the University of Texas, Austin, has demonstrated that racial profiling is just as effective as random sampling.) Harcourt argues that profiling one group diverts resources from examining others outside the group. So while it may help detect attacks in the short term, profiling could backfire in the long term as "it may well encourage the recruitment of terrorists from outside the core profile and the substitution of other terrorist acts." Michael Chertoff, Homeland Security secretary from 2005-09, offered a similar take in an Intelligence Squared debate (around the 49:15 mark) over racial profiling, which he called the "lazy man’s way out." After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, "there was a unanimous belief that racial and religious profiling would be not only ineffective, but counterproductive from a security standpoint," he said. "The fact is it would be an engraved invitation to al-Qaida to recruit exactly the kind of people who don’t fit the profile." In Israel, analysts noted a shift in who was carrying out attacks as early as a decade ago. "At first, suicide terrorists were all religious, militant young men recruited from Palestinian universities or mosques. In early 2002, however, the profile began to change as secular Palestinians, women, and even teenage girls volunteered for suicide missions," wrote Jonathan Tucker, an influential national security analyst and expert in nuclear nonproliferation, in a 2003 paper. "Suicide bombers have also sought to foil profiling efforts by shaving their beards, dyeing their hair blond, and wearing Israeli uniforms or even the traditional clothing of orthodox Jews." For these reasons, Chertoff and most national security analysts prefer predictive profiling, based on behavior. This approach led Israeli security to thwart a planned terrorist attack by an assailant who didn’t fit the profile and who didn’t even know she was carrying out an attack. In 1986, Anne-Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish woman, was cleared by Health Airport security, but El Al guards found her suspicious and discovered a false bottom in her carry-on bag with 10 pounds of explosives planted by her Jordanian boyfriend. Murphy thought she was travelling to Israel to get married. Why Israeli security is effective Ben Gurion is widely regarded as one of the safest airports in the world, and El Al one of the safest airlines. But even barring ethnic profiling, to suggest predictive profiling is the reason ignores the full scope of Israeli security. Israel’s entire security apparatus is much more comprehensive than just profiling, experts told us. For starters, the vigilance of the Israeli public is key to how the country prevents terrorism, and ordinary Israelis foil more than 80 percent of attempted terrorist attacks in Israel, according to Tucker. Israel’s intelligence gathering agencies are also more coordinated and specialized than U.S. agencies, expert said. Yoram Schweitzer, an international terrorism expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, listed a number of security measures beyond behavior profiling: Israeli airports are much smaller; their perimeters are monitored and screened around the clock; and the entire system is constantly being assessed and improved. There’s also the rigorous selection process for security officers. The personnel are military recruits who must pass intelligence and personality tests. Then they undergo nine weeks of behavior recognition training. Also, the sheer disparity in scale between Israel and the United States is a hurdle to implementing the type of concentrated, high-skilled security apparatus in Israeli airports. Israel has 47 airports, while the United States has more than 13,000, according to the CIA Factbook. While low-risk fliers at Ben Gurion, Israel’s only international airport, are cleared within a few minutes, the average checking time is 57 minutes. The airport saw about 16.3 million passengers in 2015, while more than 100 million moved through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport that year. Brandes also sees institutional differences in how the two countries approach security. For one, Israel’s "entire methodology is based on terrorism" while U.S. law enforcement "is geared towards crime and property crime," he said. For another, average Israelis are proactive about not only reporting suspicious activity but engaging with it, while "everyone in the U.S. holds and waits for the police." And finally, it’s perplexing for Trump to suggest that the United States isn’t "allowed to profile." (Our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker rated this claim Four Pinocchios.) The United States does "profile people that maybe look suspicious," and the Justice Department allows airport security and border patrol to consider race in security screenings. When the TSA attempted to adopt Israeli-style behavioral profiling through a program known as SPOT, the results were less than ideal. Former officers in the program reported in 2012 that 80 percent of passengers targeted at Boston’s Logan Airport were minorities. And a year later, the U.S. Government Accountability concluded that SPOT was ineffective and recommended the program be defunded. "I think there is a lot to learn from Israel," said Brandes, who questioned Trump’s grasp of Israeli security. When he suggests emulate the profiling, "Does he know that means?" Our ruling Trump said Israel profiles based on ethnicity and "does it very successfully." This is misleading. Israel takes ethnicity into consideration in their security screenings, but it also takes many other clues into consideration. While Israel is successful at deterring terrorism, profiling is not the sole reason. The country’s robust security apparatus and vigilant population are just as, if not more, key its safety.

pomt-01995	"The U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/12/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-memoir-theres-very-little-us-/	Let’s be honest: When Hillary Clinton announced she was writing a memoir on her four years as Secretary of State, everyone had one question. What would she say about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya? As it turns out, Clinton did not disappoint — at least on that topic. While critics have called the book a bit of a snoozer, the chapter on Benghazi is one of the longest in Hard Choices. The book explains what happened and how the State Department reacted — and offers a full-throated rebuke of Republican criticisms. In defending the United States’ response to the attack, one of the factors Clinton noted was that there’s a gap between popular perceptions about the country’s military capabilities and the reality. "Critics have questioned why the world’s greatest military force could not get to Benghazi in time to defend our people," Clinton said. "Part of the answer is that, despite having established United States Africa Command in 2008, there just wasn’t much U.S. military infrastructure in place in Africa. Unlike in Europe and Asia, the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent." Since Libya is located on the Mediterranean Sea, on Africa’s northern coast, Clinton’s claim that the U.S. military is "nearly nonexistent" in Africa is pretty consequential to the debate. In 2007, President George W. Bush announced that the United States would create a singular African command responsible for military operations throughout the continent. Prior to its creation, jurisdiction over Africa was split between combat headquarters in the Pacific, European and Middle East regions. The motivation for the change was that Pentagon planners argued that terrorism and extremism spread more easily in countries with weak governments and poor citizens susceptible to ideological messaging. In creating what would become known as AFRICOM, the U.S. hoped to improve its own security by partnering with developing countries in Africa to better handle their own security concerns and avoid another Afghanistan. Pentagon officials also thought, however, that a large U.S. military presence in these countries could become counterproductive, offering propaganda opportunities for terrorists and breeding anti-American sentiments, said Joseph Siegel, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University. The goal all along, he said, was to have a "light footprint." Instead of a large scale operation, small groups would work with African countries in training African troops to handle the unique security issues within their own borders. ''Bases? Garrisons? It's not about that,'' then-Africa Commander Gen. William E. Ward of the Army told the New York Times when AFRICOM opened in 2008. ''We are trying to prevent conflict, as opposed to having to react to a conflict." How small was the presence? A spokesman for Clinton told PolitiFact that AFRICOM is not even based in Africa. Its headquarters are in Germany, where about 1,500 of its 2,000 personnel — troops, civilians and contractors — are located. There’s very little military infrastructure or advanced weaponry and warships. Of the Department of Defense’s annual budget of $520 billion, the Africa Command accounted for just $275 million in 2012. An AFRICOM spokesman noted that Europe — geographically one-third the size of Africa -- has 12 times the number of U.S. troops. Even smaller countries like Afghanistan and South Korea have five times the U.S. forces than all of Africa does. "It’s the smallest of the commands in resources and personnel, and to my knowledge it controls very few assets that it would deploy on its own," Siegel said. There is one U.S. military base on the continent — Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, a country in the African Horn. Between 2,000 and 4,000 personnel are typically stationed there. That includes some troops, but many of those individuals are contractors or military personnel who are there to run base operations, said Larry Hanauer, a senior international policy analyst at RAND Corporation, a think tank. "We do not have combat aircraft permanently based in Africa," Hanauer said. "There are transportation aircraft in Camp Lemonnier," but not fighter jets. Even if Camp Lemonnier had those resources, Djibouti is some 2,000 miles away from Benghazi. Points in Europe are much closer, such as Rome, which is about 800 miles away. At the time of the attacks, AFRICOM had to borrow an emergency response force from Europe Command because it did not yet have one. According to a New York Times article, the Africa Command did not have a gunship or armed drones. Asked whether he thought Clinton’s statement was accurate, RAND’s Hanauer said, "I think it’s more accurate than not." Siegel of National Defense University agreed that it was a "fair statement." So did Michael O'Hanlon, a director of research for the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. "Hillary's right. The headquarters is in Germany and our total military force on the continent is a total of a few thousand at most dispersed in various small locations, not operational bases." Our ruling Clinton said, "the U.S. military footprint in Africa is nearly nonexistent." There is a military presence in Africa, but it’s limited to one base with little combat infrastructure, and it’s commanded from a location that is not even located on the continent. That’s by design; the command’s planners sought to create a preventive, collaborative force rather than one that was heavily armed. Experts we interviewed took little issue with the overall impression of her comment, particularly as it describes the United States’ challenges in responding to a crisis in north Africa.

pomt-03265	"Unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin" as Paul Ryan stepped up his advocacy of "immigration increases."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/09/federation-american-immigration-reform/group-says-wisconsin-jobless-rate-was-rise-while-p/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s role as a potential deal-maker on immigration reform has drawn criticism from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legal status for illegal immigrants and wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States. The group questions why Ryan, the Janesville Republican, would welcome more foreign laborers to America at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high in Wisconsin. "Does Congressman Ryan think Wisconsin workers aren’t good enough to get the job done?" the group asks in a TV ad. The group fleshed out its complaint in an August 5, 2013 news release. "Congressman Ryan needs to explain to thousands of Wisconsin workers, who are struggling to find jobs to support their families, why he wants to increase immigration in order to avert a labor shortage that clearly does not exist," said FAIR president Dan Stein. Then came this claim: "Ryan's advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties." Those don’t sound like good numbers. But Gov. Scott Walker has touted a declining statewide unemployment rate. And the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that June’s private-sector job gain was the largest month-to-month increase since 2003. What gives? As we reported in an August 5, 2013 item, Ryan is open to granting legal status and eventually citizenship to those who came here illegally, if they get in "back of the line," pay penalties and jump through other hoops over a 15-year period. He wants border security tackled first. In this item, we won’t evaluate whether "amnesty" is the proper description of what Ryan supports. The word means different things to different people. But we’ll examine whether "unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin" as Ryan stepped up his consensus-building efforts in the House, as the group claims. A look at the numbers There’s no dispute that unemployment rates still reflect widespread joblessness lingering after the Great Recession, with 210,000 people still unemployed in June 2013. FAIR’s larger point is well taken. But FAIR says things are getting worse. The group refers to a time period when Ryan’s advocacy "intensified", and cites the June unemployment figures in claiming that unemployment has been "on the rise throughout Wisconsin." It’s accurate to say, as FAIR did in backing up its claim, that unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties in June when compared to the previous month. Janesville, for example, saw its rate rise from 8.5 percent to 9.0 percent. Milwaukee rose from 9.9 to 10.6 percent. The figures, which are estimates, were reported by the state’s workforce development agency. The data supports the group’s claim if you interpret "throughout Wisconsin" as a geographical reference. Unemployment rose in most counties, and nearly all major municipalities. But there’s one inconvenient fact. In June, the statewide unemployment rate actually dropped from 7.0 percent to 6.8 percent despite the negative news in many local communities. How can that be? The figures are estimates drawn from a small sample, so the local numbers are less reliable than the statewide figure, noted Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. The size of the changes in different communities influences the bottom line, too. "I would say it is most responsible to watch any of these trends over time -- i.e. statewide unemployment ticking mostly but very slowly down -- or to watch the trend in municipalities over a long horizon as well," Dresser told us. "Only when you see month after month moving the same directions can you really think of it as a trend." Then there’s the matter of the time frame. It’s reasonable to say that Ryan’s public role "intensified" in June and July -- before and after the Senate passed its version of immigration reform. And as FAIR noted, the latest unemployment stats are from June. But Ryan was revving up his push back in May. He barnstormed Wisconsin early that month, pushing for reform. A Journal Sentinel article at the time noted Ryan "has plunged into the fray, using his stature with conservatives to promote a sweeping bipartisan compromise in Congress." The time frame matters because the unemployment rate increase in June was not the norm for 2013. The statewide unemployment rate has nudged up and down for the last year, settling in June at 6.8 percent, below the U.S. rate of 7.6 percent. (Wisconsin’s rate is down from the recession’s 9.2 percent peak in 2009). And, notably, rates in larger municipalities and counties have been on a roller coaster in 2013, rising in some months, falling in others, state data shows. In May, for example, 24 of the 32 largest municipalities saw a rate decrease, as did all counties but two. So the claim of an unemployment rate "on the rise" is true only if we’re talking about a one-month trend. Finally, what about the part of the claim that Ryan favors "immigration increases?" Ryan has told interviewers that fixing the legal immigration system now could help solve future labor shortages. "Not now, but in the future we're going to have labor shortages," Ryan said on The Laura Ingraham Show, June 19, 2013. "We have 10,000 people retiring each and every day in America when the Baby Boomers retire. We are not like Europe, we're not like Japan in that our birthrates are really low, but they're not high enough. Immigration, in a decade or so, can help us." Our rating FAIR says "unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin" as Ryan stepped up advocacy of "immigration increases." The group chose its words pretty carefully, clearly focusing on Ryan’s recent actions and the corresponding -- and overwhelmingly negative -- unemployment trend in most major municipalities and many counties in the most recent month. And it’s true Ryan is endorsing "immigration increases." But saying the rate "has been on the rise" suggests more than a one-month trend -- and there is no such trend in recent months. And for that one month, statewide unemployment in June fell, not rose, undercutting FAIR’s statement. There’s an element of truth here, but some critical facts create a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.	None	Federation for American Immigration Reform	None	None	None	2013-08-09T05:00:00	2013-08-05	['Wisconsin', 'Paul_Ryan']
pomt-01960	Says Dan Patrick has "called immigration into Texas an invasion" and "said immigrants coming into Texas bring ‘third-world diseases.’"	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/20/battleground-texas/dan-patrick-has-called-illegal-immigration-invasio/	A claim about Dan Patrick by an organizer for Battleground Texas, the pro-Democratic group, rang a bell. In a June 10, 2014, interview on Bloomberg TV, Jeremy Bird said Patrick, the Houston state senator who dusted incumbent David Dewhurst in the May 2014 primary runoff for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination, has "called immigration into Texas an invasion" and "said immigrants coming into Texas bring ‘third-world diseases.’ " We looked into whether Patrick made these statements and, if so, whether facts backed them up. Patrick: ‘Stop the invasion’ Patrick, championing his desire to secure the Texas-Mexico border, has often called to stop "the invasion," referring to individuals who cross the border without legal documentation. Spokeswoman Lynda Tran of Battleground Texas noted by email, Patrick has an undated online post in which he asks supporters to donate "if you agree we must stop the illegal invasion!" According to a January 2014 news story in the Dallas Morning News, Patrick and another GOP aspirant blasted Dewhurst in a Jan. 27 debate for not doing more to secure the Texas border from illegal immigration. "The first question is to stop the invasion," Patrick said. "Until you secure the border, you cannot address any other issues." It wasn’t a new cry. A Feb. 24, 2006, Texas Observer story described Patrick, then waging his first Senate campaign, as blaming illegal immigrants for a rising crime rate, overcrowded schools, an overburdened health-care system and runaway growth in the state budget. "The number one problem we are facing," the Observer quoted Patrick as saying, "is the silent invasion of the border. We are being overrun. It is imperiling our safety." More recently, Patrick shelved such language. A June 7, 2014, Texas Tribune news story said Patrick didn’t use the "invasion" term at that week’s Republican Party of Texas convention. Instead, the story said, he called on Republicans to reach out to Hispanic voters by telling them "that we stand with them for the future of their family" and that only the GOP would work to secure their communities. U.S. Border Patrol figures show its apprehensions of individuals crossing the country’s southern border declined 69 percent from a little over 1 million in the fiscal year running through September 2006 to nearly 328,000 five years later. But such apprehensions bumped up 27 percent, to 414,397,as of two years later, in fiscal 2013, the agency says. Since 2011, there’s been a surge in people from countries other than Mexico, including many minors from Central America. ‘They are bringing Third World diseases’ The Observer story revealed Patrick’s claims about disease along the border, saying Patrick characterized illegal immigrants as walking pathogens. "They are bringing Third World diseases with them," Patrick said, citing "tuberculosis, malaria, polio and leprosy." But the story quoted a physician, identified as Tim Metz, the top epidemiologist at the Texas Department of State Health Services, as saying there wasn’t a known case of polio in the Western Hemisphere when Patrick spoke "and we haven't seen it in decades." According to the Observer, Metz said malaria, a tropical disease spread by the anopheline mosquito, is easily treated and remains "a rare disease in Texas and not a huge problem." Leprosy, he said, is known today as Hansen's disease and "we have no more than 50 cases a year that are reported, but it's not on the rise." As for TB, the physician told the Observer, "we'll have 1,500 or so cases in Texas this year, which might be a slight increase, but we've got very effective TB-control programs in every local health department in the state." For our part, we didn’t identify anyone by the name of Tim Metz. When we asked the Texas Department of State Health Services for guidance, spokesman Chris Van Deusen said by email that Tom Betz (not Tim Metz) was at one time the manager of the agency’s Infectious Disease Surveillance and Epidemiology branch. Van Deusen didn’t directly speak to what Patrick reportedly said in 2006, but he indicated immigrants aren’t showing up as bringing most of the diseases listed by Patrick. Polio, Van Deusen said, has been eradicated from the Western hemisphere and "we don’t generally see cases in Texas. Van Deusen said about 100 cases of malaria are annually reported in the state. All are imported, he said, and it’s not spread person to person in Texas. "It’s generally related to travel, either people from here visiting parts of the world where malaria is endemic or people from abroad visiting the U.S., rather than immigration," he said. Cases of Hansen’s disease -- or what has been called leprosy -- are reported, Van Deusen said, with one third related to armadillos; one third tied to "old European families that have a genetic susceptibility;" and one third "related to immigration from areas of the world where the disease is more common, irrespective of the type of immigration." In April 2014, Patrick suggested critics distort what he said in 2006. Patrick bridled after San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro said to him in an immigration debate aired by Univision and posted online by the Texas Tribune: "You have talked about undocumented immigrants bringing third-world diseases including leprosy and polio to Texas. You have said that we’re seeing an illegal invasion from Mexico." Patrick shot back that his comment about disease in 2006 was based on information distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control indicating tuberculosis cases were up nationally and in Texas, "particularly along the Texas-Mexico border--and those cases were coming from Latin America," Patrick said. A 2012 CDC tuberculosis fact sheet states the disease had decreased in prevalence nationally. Some 9,945 TB cases (an average of 3.2 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported, the sheet says, and the 2012 count was the lowest since national reporting of TB commenced in 1953. Still, Texas, California and Florida were among a few states with an average number of cases exceeding the national average, according to a map with the fact sheet. Van Deusen said about half the state’s decreasing number of TB cases show up in residents born abroad. "TB often crops up in immigrant populations because of the nature of the disease where a person can be exposed to the bacteria but not develop active disease for many, many years," he wrote. "In fact, the vast majority of people who get the tuberculosis bacteria in their body will never go on to develop active TB disease because their immune systems will keep the bacteria in check." In the Univision debate, Patrick said he’d previously mentioned leprosy because the World Health Organization reported that from 2010 to 2012, cases increased in Mexico and the U.S. An online search led us to a WHO chart indicating U.S. cases of leprosy increased from 169 in 2010 to 168 in 2011 to 173 in 2012 with cases in Mexico going from 211 in 2010 up to 216 in 2011 and down to 215 in 2012. We asked Patrick’s campaign about Battleground Texas’s claim and the reports that Patrick described and didn’t hear back. Our ruling The Battleground Texas activist said Patrick has "called immigration into Texas an invasion" and Patrick has "said immigrants coming into Texas bring ‘third-world diseases.’" This year and earlier, Patrick referred to illegal immigration as an invasion that he wants to stopper. In 2006, he was quoted as saying illegal immigrants bring third-world diseases to the state. Both claims have weaknesses, but we're not judging Patrick's veracity here.

pomt-02839	Says Barack Obama’s approval rating "is right in the average" for second-term presidents at this point.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/20/ari-melber/ari-melber-says-obamas-approval-ratings-are-line-o/	This item was updated at 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 21, 2013, to include an additional comment from Melber. President Barack Obama’s job approval rating took a hit in the first few weeks of November amid a heap of controversy over implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But to hear the folks on MSNBC tell it, Obama’s poll numbers are par for the course for presidents in their second term. Ari Melber, co-host of MSNBC’s The Cycle, said during a segment on the show Monday that Obama’s approval rating isn’t so far off of some second-term presidents. "As to the approval numbers, it’s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you’ve got in the 40s this president," Melber said. "At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that’s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it’s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer. "But this notion that this is really bad or worse for Obama, it’s actually right in the average, and if anything impressive because we’re in such a super polarized time period." He spoke over a bar chart showing approval ratings of the presidents he mentioned "about 1,750 days" into their second term. Here’s a screenshot: Intrigued by his point, we looked into it. In an interview with PunditFact, Melber told us he used data from Gallup’s Presidential Job Approval Center, an interactive tool that allows users to compare Gallup approval ratings of each president since President Harry Truman (1945-53) at various points in office. Melber isolated Johnson, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. For all but Johnson, the 1,750th or so day falls around the first full week of November. (Johnson’s 1,750th day does not fall around the same time because he finished out Kennedy’s term before being re-elected, so his comparable rating is from September 1968, just months before he left office.) Obama’s 1,750th day fell during the week of Nov. 4-10, when his job approval rating was at 41 percent. For the comparable week, Johnson’s was 42 percent, Bush’s was 40 percent, and Clinton’s was 59 percent. Melber said he chose to compare those presidents because Bush is recent and the others are Democratic two-termers. "We created the graphic of four presidents' ratings in order to reference those four presidents -- not all presidents," Melber said in an email. Even by this narrow comparison, it’s not accurate to say Obama’s poll numbers are "right in the average." But we’re not sure viewers would think Melber was comparing Obama with just three other presidents -- particularly when he said "over the entire history of second-term presidents." If you expand the pool, how does Melber’s claim stand up? (Gallup’s polling goes back to Harry S. Truman.) Approval rating for presidents in their 1,750th day in office President Percent Obama 41 percent George W. Bush 40 percent Bill Clinton 59 percent Ronald Reagan 65 percent Richard Nixon 27 percent Lyndon Johnson 42 percent Dwight Eisenhower 58 percent Harry Truman 37 percent Average of all presidents 46.8 percent So the overall average approval rating for those presidents, under Melber’s metric, is about 47 percent -- 6 percentage points higher than Obama. Another way to look at the data Gallup editor in chief Frank Newport said there’s no right way to compare the approval ratings, but he would use a different method. He looked at the monthly average of polls for presidents in the first November of their second term. He argued this way smooths out weekly blips, and offers a more accurate portrayal of Truman and Johnson, who shared first terms with predecessors who died in office. Comparing by the number of days served puts Johnson well into his second term in September 1968, when his approval rating began to sour over the Vietnam War, Newport said. That exaggerates the disparity. Using Newport’s methodology, second-term presidents had an average approval rating of about 51 percent. Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Melber is correct about one thing: This is one of the most polarized eras in American history. "Sometimes it seems to me that the American people are living in different countries, or different universes," she said. "Republicans and Democrats have completely different impressions." Bowman also would have gone about the comparison in a different way, starting by including Reagan over Johnson, and by looking at different polls, too. (A CBS News poll released Wednesday, after Melber’s segment, put his approval rating at 37 percent. Gallup’s three-day rolling average for Nov. 17-19 was down to 40 percent.) She said the political climate was so different in Truman and Eisenhower’s time that she, like Melber, would have left them out. She empathized with Melber trying to make a point in a tight crunch on television. "People pick and choose polling data they want to highlight," Bowman said. "I think he should have been more precise in his wording, but I’m not gonna give him darts and arrows for this kind of thing." Our ruling Melber said: "As to the approval numbers, it’s very important to understand, we look at Gallup over the entire history of second-term presidents, and you’ve got in the 40s this president. At the same point, 1,700 days or so in, that’s exactly about where (George) W. Bush was, it’s where LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) was. (Bill) Clinton was higher because he was a very popular second-termer." Depending on what presidents you pick, and how you gauge the time frame, Melber comes close. Obama’s approval ratings are roughly in the range of some presidents. But looking at the numbers other ways produce vastly different results. Melber’s claim is partially accurate but take things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Ari Melber	None	None	None	2013-11-20T17:25:00	2013-11-18	['None']
pomt-09274	"Congress can tell [the Supreme Court] which cases they ought to hear. We have that authority."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/28/arlen-specter/specter-says-congress-can-tell-supreme-court-wh/	With Washington bracing for President Barack Obama to announce his next Supreme Court nominee, Sen. Arlen Specter, a leading Democrat on his chamber's Judiciary Committee, has been sharing his views on the upcoming debate. During an interview on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown, Specter told hosts Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie that he thinks the court has been avoiding tough cases, such as the constitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program. Specter said he's even considering conditioning his vote for the nominee based on whether he or she will take up such cases. "The Supreme Court has a very light backlog," he said. "They leave a lot of splits among the circuits, a lot of uncertainty. And I think they ought to work a lot harder. . . . Congress can tell them which cases they ought to hear. We have that authority. And I think Congress ought to exercise it." The last time we checked, there were strict barriers between the three branches of government, so we were curious about Specter's comment. Specter's comment is a bit cryptic; it reads as if he's saying that Congress can tell the court that it must hear a specific case. His office did not respond to our request for comment, but the experts we spoke with said that he's referring to Article III of the Constitution, which gives Congress the authority to establish appellate jurisdiction. "In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make," the Article states. In plain English, all that means is that Congress can tell the Court what genre of cases it must hear. For instance, it must hear appeals on voting issues. Here's what section 5 the Voting Rights Act of 1965 said about states that seek to establish voting qualifications or prerequisites: "Any action under this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the United States Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court." So, appeals on decisions made by the special three-judge court regarding changes in voting qualifications must be heard by the Supreme Court. Appeals to the campaign finance rules set out in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 -- commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act named for the two senators who wrote it -- face a similar trajectory: Complaints are first heard by a three-judge court, and are ultimately decided by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. The law also requires the Supreme Court to hear these cases in an expedited fashion. In fact, for much of the last century, many cases fell within the Supreme Court's mandatory jurisdiction, according to the legal scholars we spoke with. But in 1988, Congress passed a bill that abolished requirements that the Supreme Court hear most appeals cases (although it did preserve mandatory jurisdiction over some types of appeals cases, including voting rights cases). The idea was to save the Court precious time that it was otherwise wasting on appeals that had little significance. So, is Specter correct? "It is up to Congress to identify which cases should go to the Court via appeal," Mark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote to us in an e-mail. "So, basically, Senator Specter's right." "Congress can't look around and say, 'Here's one particular case you have to decide on the merits,'" Tushnet added. "They do have to act in general terms." Specter claimed that Congress can tell the Supreme Court which cases it must hear. According to the Constitution, Congress has the authority to do just that: it can write legislation that gives the court appellate jurisdiction over certain cases, as it did when it passed the Voting Rights Act. However, our experts said Congress cannot tell the Court that is must hear a specific case. We find Specter's claim True.	None	Arlen Specter	None	None	None	2010-04-28T22:52:31	2010-04-21	['None']
pomt-12601	"When you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-flubs-how-unemployment-calculated/	At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump revived some of his longstanding concerns about how the nation’s unemployment statistics are calculated. Appearing to reference the number of Americans out of work, Trump said, "We have 100 million people if you look. You know, the real number's not 4.6 percent (for the unemployment rate). They told me I had 4.6 percent last month. I'm doing great. I said yeah, but what about the hundred million people? A lot of those people came out and voted for me. I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman. But a lot of those people -- a good percentage of them would like to have jobs and they don't. You know, one of the statistics that, to me, is just ridiculous -- so, the 4.6 sounds good. But when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed. But I don't consider those people employed." Is Trump right that "when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed"? Not at all. Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand. That’s not the case. Broadly speaking, if someone is already considered unemployed and they give up looking for a job, they would be counted as "not in the labor force" -- not as "employed." In fact, there is an official statistical category for a person in this situation. If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called "discouraged workers." Specifically, these people "want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months" but are "not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify." The problem for Trump is that "discouraged workers" are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 522,000 of them. That’s just one-fourteenth the number of unemployed workers, and only about one-half of 1 percent of the "out of work" Americans Trump seems to have been referring to. Speaking of which, as we have noted previously, Trump’s 100-million figure of "out of work" Americans is highly misleading. This number -- in reality, a bit lower at 94 million -- includes any American age 16 and over who isn’t institutionalized and who isn’t either working or actively looking for work. This means the figure includes retirees, high school students over 16, undergraduate and graduate students, stay-at-home parents, disabled people, adults who are engaged in full-time education or training, and even trust-fund kids and those wealthy enough to be living off investments. In other words, the figure includes a lot of people who wouldn’t be expected to be working, or who are engaged in other pursuits. We have previously estimated that no more than a quarter of the 94 million people not in the labor market are either out of work, looking for a job, or eager to get back in the job hunt if labor-market conditions were to improve. Here's a chart from the jobs site Indeed.com showing one analysis of the reasons that prime-working-age Americans may not be working. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So suggesting that roughly 100 million Americans are out of work ropes in many people who, in fact, have no desire to find paid employment. Our ruling Trump said, "When you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up. You are now considered statistically employed." That’s flat wrong -- someone who stops looking for work would be shifted to the "out of the labor force" category, not the "employed category." We rate the statement False.

pomt-03260	"If we use (Tax Increment Financing) funding, that's going to take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County, as it will take funds from the general fund for the city of St. Pete."	false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/09/kathleen-ford/pier-funding-will-take-funds-general-fund-pinellas/	St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster and challenger Kathleen Ford tangled over paying for the Lens, the proposed pier replacement, at a debate last week. Foster said the money was use-it-or-lose-it, while Ford said the plan takes money from the city’s general funds. "If we use (Tax Increment Financing) funding, that's going to take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County, as it will take funds from the general fund for the city of St. Pete," Ford said. We decided to look into Ford's comments. (We'll look at Foster's in a separate fact-check.) Let’s go back to 1969, when the Florida Legislature passed the Community Redevelopment Act. The intent was to allow a city and a county to target a specific geographic area -- say, a downtown -- for improvements. The law allows local officials to create a Community Redevelopment Area, so that a portion of property taxes collected in the area can be used for major development projects there. In 1981, the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County set up such an area with the goal of paying for projects downtown. Each time the property taxes within the area rise above the 1981 level, that additional money goes into an improvement fund, usually called TIF, which stands for tax increment financing. We should note that a pier project of some kind has long been on the drawing board. The inverted pyramid made its debut in 1973 and underwent a major renovation in 1987. Since at least 2005, city officials have been looking at either another renovation or a total replacement, paid for with TIF money. Community Redevelopment Areas usually only last 30 years, and then the districts dissolve. But in 2005, the Board of County Commissioners granted the city a 30-year extension until 2035, said Ken Welch, a Pinellas County commissioner. Ford’s point is that if St. Petersburg’s district didn’t exist, the property tax money would go into the city and county’s general funds. But the district does exist, and that means TIF money is out of bounds for the city’s day-to-day operations or anything outside the downtown district, said Joe Zeoli, managing director of administration and finance in city development. City leaders have never supported abandoning the pier without a replacement, Zeoli said. Though Ford doesn’t support the Lens design, she did advocate refurbishing the inverted pyramid at Tuesday’s debate. Refurbishment money would likely come from the TIF fund. Right now there’s about $50 million in TIF money available for a pier project, with about $37 million of that intended for construction. If the money isn’t spent by 2035, only then could the county reclaim its 44 percent share. The city would take the remaining money. Voters will approve or reject the Lens on Aug. 27. If the Lens fails and a different pier project goes forward, the same method of financing would apply, Welch said. What had been coming from the general fund is a roughly $1.5 million subsidy for yearly operating costs for the now-closed inverted pyramid pier structure. The Lens would call for a $680,000 annual subsidy, as estimated by a third party, said Chris Ballestra, the city’s managing director of development coordination. "Any new project including a revamp of the inverted pyramid would likely reduce that $1.5 million burden," Ballestra said, not just the proposed Lens. If the new structure makes the surrounding property more valuable, then taxes in that area would go up and feed back into the TIF fund, said David Cruz, Florida League of Cities legislative advocate. The TIF money means no money for pier construction comes from general city funds. It doesn’t raise people’s tax bills, nor does it come from money the city is allowed to re-appropriate. Our ruling Ford said that TIF money takes away money from the city’s general fund, implying that taxpayers would pay for the Lens with money that could be used elsewhere. Actually, the funds come from a special financing district, not from general funds. We rate her claim False.	None	Kathleen Ford	None	None	None	2013-08-09T16:16:48	2013-08-06	['None']
pomt-00305	"The national economy was strong in its largest expansion of private sector jobs before President Trump came into office."	true	/virginia/statements/2018/sep/25/tim-kaine/ne-right-record-jobs-growth-streak-precedes-trump/	U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine had an old prediction tossed back at him during a debate this summer. It was thrown by moderator Judy Woodruff, the anchor and managing editor of PBS NewsHour. She reminded Kaine that in 2016, when he was the Democratic nominee for vice president, he said the election of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump "would be a disaster for the economy." Woodruff asked Kaine to square that with the strong economic results during the first 18 months of the Trump administration: about 3 million new jobs, the unemployment rate dipping below 4 percent, and "soaring" corporate profits. Kaine replied, "The national economy was strong, in its longest expansion in private sector jobs, before President Trump came into office." We fact-checked Kaine’s claim that Trump, when he became president on Jan. 20, 2017, inherited the nation’s longest expansion of private jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps monthly records on private sector employment back to 1939. They show that the U.S. experienced 82 months straight months of private sector job growth before Trump became president - from March 2010 through December 2016, when Barack Obama was in the White House. That easily qualifies for the longest streak during the eight decades the BLS had been keeping the statistics prior to Trump’s presidency. The streak is still alive under Trump and - through August 2018, the latest statistics are available - is up to 112 months. The second longest streak was 64 months. It ran from May 1995 through October 2000, when Bill Clinton was president. The longest continuous drop in private employment lasted 22 months - from January 2008 through October 2009 during the Great Recession. That was during the last year of George W. Bush’s administration and the first year of Obama’s. Presidents from both political parties traditionally have been quick to claim the credit for good economies and fast to dodge the blame when times turn bad. Economists have repeatedly told us it’s mostly a political dance; that the policies of presidents and governors don’t drive economic ups and downs. Our ruling Kaine said, "The national economy was strong in its largest expansion of private sector jobs before President Trump came into office." Data shows he’s right. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08343	"Donna Campbell has called for ending all federal funding for education"	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/28/lloyd-doggett/rep-lloyd-doggett-says-donna-campbell-has-called-e/	Calling his opponent "too extreme for Central Texas," U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, says in a mailer that Republican nominee Donna Campbell "has called for ending all federal funding for education." We won’t judge whether Campbell’s extreme for Doggett’s constituents. But has she proposed an end to federal education aid? Some perspective: Federal aid accounts for a sliver of overall U.S. public school funding. During the 2007-08 school year, such aid totaled $48 billion, which was 8.2 percent of total public school funding, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education. The federal slice was slightly bigger in Texas: about 10 percent of the public education budget, according to the center. According to the Texas Education Agency, during the 2007-08 school year, Texas public schools received $4.3 billion in federal aid, amounting to about 9.5 percent of public education funding in the state. We wondered if Campbell wants to stop the flow of those dollars. Mike Asmus, a spokesman for Campbell’s campaign, said: "I’ve not heard her call for ending all federal funding for education." We asked Doggett’s campaign for its back-up. Spokeswoman Amanda Tyler forwarded two video clips. The first, from a Nov. 23, 2009 episode of the Austin public-access cable TV show, "The Trailer Park Show." The clip shows Campbell looking slightly out of place in a suit sitting behind a table with a diverse cast of characters. "Would you vote to end federal funding for education?" a man calling into the show asks. Campbell responds: "Federal funding for education? Yes. Because ... it’s a job of the states. Choices need to be put back in the hands of the parents and state." Another man sitting at the table says he thinks that it’s the federal government’s responsibility to educate citizens, which means helping students attend college if they otherwise couldn’t afford it. "And I strongly believe through financial aid, government should step in there and support these students because they are working hard," he says. "They want to be productive citizens of our society." Campbell responds: "But government is state also. The states can do it."Later, she says: "Do I support education? Absolutely. But it needs to go back in the choices of the parents and leave it with the state." Doggett quotes the first part of that exchange — Campbell saying she would vote to end federal funding for education — in his mailer and shows it in an ad posted on YouTube Oct. 13. We e-mailed the video clip to Asmus. He replied: "Thanks for running this clip past me — having now watched it, I still see the statement on Mr. Doggett’s mailer as inaccurate." In a later e-mail, Asmus told us Campbell "has not ‘called’ for anything; she is answering a question. Also, the question does not include the word ‘all,’ nor does her answer." The other clip Doggett’s campaign sent us — also posted on Campbell’s campaign website — shows both candidates talking about federal education aid at an Oct. 19 Bastrop Chamber of Commerce candidates forum. According to the clip, Campbell was asked how she would fund education while cutting federal spending. She replied that too many strings are currently attached. "Why not have money that is from Texas stay in Texas to fund Texas schools?" she said. "Why should any Texas money — when we have a good economy within Texas, relative to other states — why should Texas money go to other schools in the nation?" We looked for other instances of Campbell explaining her position on federal education funding when her campaign e-mailed an Oct. 22 statement in which she stands against federal involvement in the schools, saying improvements happen "best when driven at the local level." It doesn’t say anything about stemming federal education aid. On her campaign website, Campbell also challenges the federal role in education, though we found no call to end federal aid. "Federal bureaucrats have become too involved in our schools," an education issues page on the site says, "preventing teachers from doing their jobs effectively... I will fight for local educators and stand up against the broken and unaccountable bureaucracy in Washington that is all too willing to experiment with our children’s education. In an interview aired Oct. 22 by Austin’s KXAN, Channel 36, Campbell responded to Doggett’s ad: "Monies that arise from Texas from our taxes should stay in Texas to fund Texas schools, not be sent to Washington D.C. to redistribute that education money. Leave it in Texas." We sought to interview Campbell; Asmus said she wasn’t available. And our grade? No question, Campbell said last year she would vote to end federal funding for education. She has not repeated that exact statement. In campaign materials, she advocates against federal involvement in Texas schools, but doesn’t explicitly call for ending federal aid. That said, Campbell also has not clarified or backed off on saying she’d vote to end such federal funding. We rate Doggett’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06331	A bill supported by Gov. Scott Walker makes it "so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/10/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-walker-supported-b/	State prosecutors are scrambling to fend off fresh legal challenges to drunken-driving cases, with defense lawyers scoring some early victories under restrictive new evidence standards. The new rules -- which can make it harder to get police testimony and field sobriety tests admitted into court -- sprang from a legal-reform push in January 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker and Republican lawmakers. Republicans’ primary goal was to make it easier to block unreliable expert testimony and so-called junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses. But the change applies to all types of civil and criminal actions, a move that led the state district attorney’s association to predict before passage that the new rules would "significantly curtail our ability to prove our cases" -- including in charges of operating while intoxicated. That aspect of the law got a sharper characterization when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin -- gearing up for a recall drive against Walker -- blasted the governor on a host of issues. Amid complaints about the budget bill, concealed carry legislation and changes related to sex-ed in schools, the party in a news release declared that a Walker administration move makes it so that "drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it." Amid the rhetoric is an interesting claim: Does Act 2, the legal reform legislation, really mean an easier go for drunken drivers, either in criminal prosecutions or in personal injury suits against them? Asked to back up its claim, the Democrats cited three pieces of evidence: Mothers Against Drunk Drivers’ opposition to Act 2; the bill’s limits on court-ordered punitive damages in civil cases; and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts. But Republicans decided to exempt drunken-driving crash victims from the punitive damage limits in civil cases. So that point is off the mark. The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers position is a moving target. The group opposed the bill initially, but then dropped its opposition after lawmakers added the punitive damage exemption -- and is now seeking a partial legislative fix in reaction to the new evidence rules. As for the evidence rules themselves, prosecutors say the issue is real and the change puts new pressures on them. We talked to numerous lawyers and researchers and they said the changes were significant, but welcome in concept. Almost all agreed the old standards allowed in too much. The new standards are used in federal courts, and by more than 30 states. Since the bill’s Feb. 1, 2011 start date, challenges to OWI evidence have played out in courtrooms and prosecutor’s offices under the new law. Both sides expect many more battles as the "Daubert standard" rules (from a Supreme Court case, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.) come into play in more cases. In our interviews with lawyers in several counties, we did not discover any OWI homicide trials affected by the new Daubert standard -- the focus of the Democrats’ claim. But those cases would be subject to the same advantages and disadvantages as other OWI cases. And there are some examples we can dig into there: St. Croix County: In a criminal case of alleged driving drunk with a child passenger, defense attorney Aaron Nelson used the new evidence standards to challenge the vision test in which an officer moves a finger or item in front of a suspect’s eyes. After the trial began, the judge disallowed testimony about the eye test. A jury on Nov. 1, 2011 found the defendant not guilty. Dane County: A pretrial defense challenge to field sobriety tests in a second-offense OWI case led a judge to block the arresting officer from answering whether he believed the suspect was impaired -- a common question at trials and one that is typically a powerful weapon for prosecutors. The case, already weak due to a paperwork error during the arrest, was pleaded down to reckless use of a vehicle, said assistant district attorney Everett Mitchell. Sheboygan County: Prosecutors beat back a Daubert challenge, but others are pending, leading District Attorney Joe DeCecco to plot a strategy of aggressive pretrial attempts to argue that officers and others can testify as experts on intoxication. "Most of the Daubert challenges have been on drunk driving," DeCecco noted. Ozaukee County: In a drunken driving case, a defense lawyer challenged the qualifications of people who collect and store blood at state hygiene labs that do forensic testing for such cases, according to District Attorney Adam Gerol. The case is pending. In the very early stages here, we found that a loose cadre of defense attorneys are sharing tips on how to mount challenges that DAs told us cause worrisome delays. "This will protract cases in the long run," said Gerol, who likes the Daubert standard overall. But what’s been the experience of prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have Daubert? Nationally, the reality doesn’t look one-sided, we found. Generally speaking prosecutors have found the new standards to be fairly neutral, just more work in defending the reliability of tests and witnesses, said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association. On the defense side, national expert Michael Hawkins of Atlanta, said the tougher rules could produce an "unintended benefit" for some defendants, but only when evidence doesn’t pass legal muster. "It doesn’t make it ‘easier’ on drunk drivers," said Hawkins, a National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers’ expert on drunken driving issues. "It makes it so prosecutors have to do more work to assure judges and juries that the evidence they are using is accurate and reliable." Yes, prosecutors in Wisconsin are having a tougher go of it in first skirmishes here. But the rules apply to both sides. Defense attorneys acknowledge they will have have to introduce better and more reliable evidence under the new standards as well. In fact, Andrew Mishlove, a nationally certified OWI defense lawyer who is helping train judges and lawyers on the new standards, told us a half-dozen common defense strategies might wilt now under the tougher evidence rules. Among them: That testing equipment failed, or that radio frequency interference led to false readings of blood-alcohol level. Overall the new standard will "prevent the defense from putting on bogus experts or questionable experts," said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois-based OWI lawyer who is nationally recognized. Ramsell noted something pertinent to the Democrats’ claim about "drivers who kill." He and others said both sides will have a tougher time presenting testimony on estimates of a person’s intoxication level at the time of an incident -- when the test wasn’t taken until hours after the arrest. In fatal-crash homicide cases, the prosecution will be hurt more often in that scenario, Ramsell said, because often the drunken driver is often injured too, preventing a timely blood test. Looking ahead, what can we expect? On the prosecution side, the big concern is that arresting officers were formerly treated as experts who could draw conclusions about sobriety tests -- but now are being challenged, along with the tests, and police training methods. In cases that already have some evidence weaknesses -- for example, the defendant refused breath and blood tests, or the tests were delayed -- these challenges can be important, lawyers on both sides said. Under the new system, judges are the gatekeepers of what is reliable and relevant scientific testimony, in contrast to past practice of letting juries hear almost everything. Some judges have concerns about testimony that has been routinely allowed in the past -- such as the follow-the-finger vision test known as Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN). Those test are not allowed as evidence in some states. "There are judges that feel like (the vision test) is voodoo because of a conception they have," said Emily Thompson, an assistant district attorney in Dane County who handles crash cases, including fatalities involving alcohol. Such concerns have led the Wisconsin chapter of MADD, the advocacy group, to call for the Legislature to revisit Act 2and exempt drunken-driving cases from the new evidence rules. "This aspect is troubling and MADD hopes the Legislature remedies the oversight as we support prosecutors who often face a daunting task in making sure justice is served and criminal charges relating to drunk driving are fully prosecuted," MADD spokesman Frank Harris told us. Ultimately the state’s high courts will decide how the issue plays out. But most experts and lawyers are predicting neither side will gain clear advantage; others say wait and see. Some prosecutors see some advantages long-term. There’s agreement that fairness will increase. Said Marquette University law professor Daniel Blinka when asked if OWI defendants would have an easier time: "I don’t see how that’s going to happen." Our conclusion The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that one of Walker’s actions was to make it "so that drunk drivers who kill have an easier time of it." One of their talking points to back up the statement -- related to civil lawsuits -- doesn’t hold up given amendments made to the bill. Their other issue, regarding Act 2’s tougher standard for scientific testimony, clearly does affect drunken driving prosecutions. And the law already has benefited some drunken drivers, though not in every instance where scientific evidence was challenged. (We did not find a homicide case affected, but they would be subject to similarly varied effects as would regular OWI cases.) So we think there’s an element of truth in the Dems’ statement. Some defendants already have found an easier road. But the statement implies the net effect of the law is tipped pro-defense. In OWI cases, that is an unknown at this point. Both sides -- defense and prosecution -- are subject to the new standards. And even defense-side experts don’t buy the "easier road" argument. Finally, we think it’s misleading to suggest -- as the party’s statement did -- that the intent of the bill was to favor homicidal drunken drivers. It clearly wasn’t. We rate the party’s claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2011-11-10T09:00:00	2011-11-01	['None']
pomt-02318	State Medicaid expansion "will save our treasury $1 billion over the next eight years."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/30/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-medicaid-expansion-will-save-virgin/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says expanding the state’s Medicaid program would allow Virginia to save money by offering health coverage to 400,000 poor and disabled citizens. "PriceWaterhouse just did an analysis," McAuliffe said on Feb. 26 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. "We will save our state treasury $1 billion over the next eight years. So we can provide coverage and we can save our treasury over $1 billion, which we then can invest in pre-K and other top priorities." The potential savings is a key issue as the General Assembly struggles this spring to decide whether to expand Medicaid eligibility -- a stalemated debate that is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. House Republicans staunchly oppose the enlargement, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to keep its Obamacare promise to pick up the full tab for the added enrollees over the next three years and pay 90 percent of the cost down the road. They’ve accused McAuliffe, a Democrat, of overstating the possible savings. We asked the governor’s office for proof of the $1 billion in savings, a claim McAuliffe has made repeatedly. Spokesman Brian Coy sent a Jan. 23 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch saying Medicaid expansion "would produce savings of $1 billion through 2022." So we turned to the original source: PricewaterhouseCoopers’ analysis, which was presented to General Assembly members in late January. The study looked at the fiscal effect that the entire Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, would have on the Virginia’s Medicaid program. It concluded that the law offers Virginia $1.021 billion in savings through mid 2022. But the charts show that Virginia will save $420 million of that sum regardless of whether it expands Medicaid. The savings will largely come from two other parts of Obamacare: increased federal funding to provide health coverage to low income children and higher than expected rebates from drug manufacturers to defray the state’s cost of Medicaid prescriptions. Virginia still stands to save a significant chunk of money by broadening eligibility for Medicaid, but not as much as the governor said. If the expansion began on July 1, the analysis says Virginia would save $601 million through mid-2022. The main reason is that the state would no longer need to pay hospitals and clinics for their losses from treating indigent patients -- adults who can’t afford private insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. The expansion would make Medicaid to available to people earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line, or $15,521 in a one-person household and $20,921 in a two-person household. Virginia’s currently has three income thresholds for Medicaid eligibility based on where in the state a person lives. The average cutoff for adults is household income exceeding 32.7 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs Virginia’s Medicaid Program. That breaks down to annual earnings of about $3,846 for a one-person household and $5,144 for a two-person household. The Medicaid cutoff for pregnant women in Virginia is 143 percent of the poverty line, or about $16,817. Our ruling McAuliffe says Virginia will save $1 billion if the General Assembly expands eligibility for MedicaId. But the analysis he cites says the state will save $420 million of that sum, regardless of whether it broadens Medicare, from other provisions in Obamacare. The research concludes that $601 million in savings over the next eight years are riding on the legislature's decision. So McAuliffe is right that there’s a lot of expansion money on the table, but he exaggerates how much. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08993	Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis wrongly takes credit for small-business program	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/14/leonidas-raptakis/raptakis-says-mollis-wrongly-takes-credit-small-bu/	There have been few winners in the recession that has gripped Rhode Island these past few years. Families have struggled to pay their bills while companies scrambled to keep their doors open. But if there was any upside, business owners say it was that state leaders finally took notice of them. Politicians clamored to meet with them, trotting them out in public and promising to make it easier for them to do business in Rhode Island. The courtship culminated this spring in the unveiling of a multi-part plan intended to cut the time and headaches it takes to register businesses and get permits. Elected officials including the governor, the House speaker and the Senate president gathered on two occasions to praise their collective work. But it was Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis who garnered the greatest praise. State leaders applauded the secretary for proposing an online master application that requires businesses to fill out just one form and allows them to complete many registration processes online. Not so, says Mollis' Democratic opponent, state Sen. Leonidas "Lou" Raptakis. In announcing his campaign against Mollis, he declared that the program that Mollis was praised for was actually created years ago by then-Secretary of State James Langevin and was further developed through a law passed by another former secretary, Matt Brown. "Jim Langevin launched a First Stop Business Information Center to help small businesses cut through the red tape of having to file multiple forms with dozens of state agencies just to get started. Former Secretary of State Matt Brown built on that effort by winning passage of legislation to create a Business Fast Start office to bring state agencies together to develop a Master Business Application—one state form to replace the dozens," his announcement said. Raptakis said Mollis ignored the program for the first three years of his term, before reintroducing the proposal as his own this spring. Jim Langevin? Matt Brown? Did Mollis really ignore laws established by his predecessors and then take credit for them? We couldn't resist putting this one to the Truth-O-Meter test. State archives show that neither candidate has it quite right. Here's the basic history. In 2001, at the urging of then-Secretary of State Edward Inman (he succeeded Langevin, who was elected to Congress), legislators passed a law establishing a "Business Fast Start Office." The idea was to create a customer service department for businesses within the secretary of state's office. The department was also supposed to recommend ways to simplify business licensing processes and to "develop a master application form that consolidates the information needed..." Sounds a lot like what Mollis says he did. The unit apparently got up and running under Inman, but the master application did not. When Matt Brown was elected secretary of state in 2002, he made some progress, launching pieces of an online registration system, according to Thomas Viall, general manager of the private company that is contracted to do Internet work for the state on its ri.gov website. Viall recalls working on the project with Brown: "It was kind of an experiment, doing what Secretary Mollis is now going to achieve. But it was very much a scaled down idea," he said. The site launched, but quickly hit a snag when officials realized that it would need constant (and expensive) updating any time there were changes to business regulations. A year or so after the website went public, Viall said it was already out of date and the office asked him to take it down. Fast forward to 2006, when Mollis ran for office. One of his campaign promises was helping small businesses. In a commentary piece written in The Providence Journal: "I have proposed a multi-phased business program in the Corporations Division ...[it] would host a master application system, provided to cut through the bureaucratic red tape in incorporating businesses." He did not mention that the law establishing the program had been put on the books years earlier. Mollis spokesman Christopher Barnett attributed the omission to space constraints. "We only had so many words and we had to pick the ones that [were] most germane to the people who read it," Barnett said. Mollis said that soon after he took office, he reestablished the dormant fast start office and began lobbying for legislative support for the master application idea, which ultimately was approved and funded this spring. Why the delay? Mollis said it took the first three years of his administration to determine how complex and expensive the technology would be and to convince lawmakers to provide funding. Raptakis says Mollis' failure to voice his plans until this spring suggests he didn't have any idea in the works. But records show the secretary of state testified in favor of the master application at a Senate committee hearing on Oct. 27, 2009, identifying it as a priority for his administration. Mollis says he was well aware of the 2001 Inman law and it's unfair for Raptakis to suggest he was not. He acknowledges, however, that he never knew about Brown's temporary launch of the online program. Staffers who worked with both administrations never told him, he said. But we're not judging a Mollis statement. We're looking at what Raptakis said. While he is correct in noting that the master application idea long preceded Mollis, Raptakis never did his homework to determine the origins of the law, when it was passed, or whether it was implemented in the ensuing nine years. He relied instead on a June 30, 2008 statement from the Washington-based Democratic Leadership Council, which praised Brown for creating the master application (but apparently forgot to check whether it actually succeeded, which it did not). It is clear to us that Mollis did not give his predecessors appropriate credit for coming up with the ideas he is finally now making happen. And Raptakis was right to pick up on that. Had he focused only on that discrepancy and not on Matt Brown's and Jim Langevin's so-called accomplishments, his statement would have more credibility. But he didn't. That's why we're calling it Half True.	None	Leonidas Raptakis	None	None	None	2010-07-14T18:29:45	2010-06-23	['None']
pomt-05168	Says Joe Kyrillos "voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/17/robert-menendez/robert-menendez-claims-joe-kyrillos-voted-raid-pen/	A theme is emerging in New Jersey’s U.S. Senate race: opponents blaming one another for bloating government debt. Republican challenger state Sen. Joe Kyrillos has tied U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to growth in the national debt and deficits. In an interview on NJTV’s "On the Record" that aired June 8, Menendez, a Democrat, responded to those charges. "Well first of all, evidently my Republican opponent has selective memory," Menendez said, first citing growth in state debt under Kyrillos’ watch. Then, Menendez said: "Here's someone who raided the state's -- voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money." Kyrillos helped pushed through a controversial plan in 1997 from then-Gov. Christie Whitman to sell nearly $2.8 billion in bonds in a bid to cover unfunded liabilities in the state’s pension system. To be clear, we are not ruling on whether the pension bonds were sound fiscal policy. We are also not ruling on Whitman’s overall impact on the pension system. We’re looking at two, specific claims: whether voting for the bonds constituted a $2.8 billion raid on the pension system and whether they are costing taxpayers $15 billion to pay off. Both statements veer from the truth, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The bond legislation -- approved on June 5, 1997, with Kyrillos voting in favor of it -- authorized the state’s Economic Development Authority to sell $2.75 billion in bonds, the proceeds of which were deposited in state retirement funds for public workers. A separate, companion bill changed accounting rules for the pension system and allowed the state and local employers to reduce their normal contributions by the amount of surplus in the funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid making nearly $600 million in payments into the pension system that year, which helped balance her budget. Melissa Castro, a spokeswoman for the Menendez campaign, said "skipping scheduled payments into the pension system is a raid of pension funds, because by definition, it is reducing the total funds available to pay the funds' obligations." Whitman skipped payments that year -- as she did in others -- but she put nearly $2.8 billion of borrowed money in the funds. That does not fit the definition of a raid. Now, what’s the final price tag for those pension bonds, which mature in 2029? Menendez put the tab at nearly $15 billion. According to the state Treasury Department, the bonds -- which the state is paying more than 7 percent interest on -- will cost $10.1 billion to pay off. The general fund shoulders the burden of the bond payments, not the pension system. Treasury Department spokesman Andy Pratt said it’s unfair to look at the expense of the bonds without also considering the investment interest the money is earning. The average rate of return has been 6.36 percent a year, Pratt said. Ultimately, the state’s general fund is still on the hook for $10.1 billion. In the upcoming budget, debt service on the bonds will cost nearly $300 million. Castro said whether it was $15 billion or $10 billion, Menendez is still correct on his fundamental point. "Nevertheless this is still bad fiscal policy," she said. Our ruling Menendez said Kyrillos "voted to raid the state's pension funds by $2.8 billion that is costing New Jersey taxpayers still today to the tune of nearly $15 billion dollars to repay that money." Kyrillos voted in favor of borrowing $2.75 billion to put into the state’s pension funds. The move allowed Whitman to avoid nearly $600 million in pension payments that year, but overall, money went into the system, not out of it. To call it a vote to raid pension funds by $2.8 billion is inaccurate. Also, the bonds will cost taxpayers, in total, about $10.1 billion, not $15 billion. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12482	"In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/may/02/tariq-el-shabazz/philly-da-candidate-blasts-investigative-journalis/	DA candidate Tariq El-Shabazz went nuclear on reporter Ryan Briggs last week after Briggs published an investigative story on City & State PA questioning El-Shabazz’s handling of a 2000 murder case. In a two-page critique released on Twitter, El-Shabazz referred to Briggs as a "fake news reporter" and accused him of racism. The long statement, released Friday, also suggested Briggs had incorrectly stated the former client of El Shabazz was on death row and included this line: "In my 30 year career including dozens of capital cases, not a single client of mine has ever been sentenced to death." Has El-Shabazz really never represented someone who was sentenced to death? We’ll start with Anthony Brown. Briggs’ article originally included the following passage: "With nothing but death row ahead of him, Brown began to file state and federal court petitions largely centering around El-Shabazz’s failure to investigate his case." According to a Philadelphia Daily News article from 2000, Brown was given a life sentence for the murder. State records also indicate nobody by the name Anthony Brown has been sentenced to death in Pennsylvania. Greg Salisbury, editor of City & State PA, said the line about death row was a copy editing error. He said the story was corrected Monday. The above sentence now reads, "With nothing but the rest of his life in prison ahead of him," and a correction is noted at the end of the piece. But another client of El-Shabazz, infamous drug dealer Kaboni Savage, presents a murkier picture. In 2013, Savage was given a federal death sentence for 12 counts of murder, six of which stemmed from a 2004 retaliatory fire bombing in North Philly. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage during the federal case for which he received the death penalty. Salima Suswell, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz, said he was disqualified from representing Savage because of a conflict of interest and couldn’t represent him. The conflict arose because of the earlier case in which he repped Savage. In federal court filings, El-Shabazz is not listed as an attorney for Savage in the case. The earliest motion by the defense comes from Christopher Warren, who was a court-appointed attorney. Savage wasn’t El-Shabazz’s client in that matter, Suswell said. "So the statement stands as true." A 2004 Inquirer article indicates El-Shabazz was representing Savage when the drug dealer was already being suspected — but not yet charged — in the fire bombing. The article explains that the FBI was targeting Savage, lists El-Shabazz as his lawyer and quotes him as saying Savage had nothing to do with the firebombing "directly or indirectly." So the fact-check comes down to this question: Is it fair for a lawyer to say none of his clients have ever been sentenced to death when a major client of his received a death sentence in a case he didn’t litigate after being disqualified from representing him? Two legal experts say yes. Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at Penn, said given the context, El-Shabazz’s statement is not incorrect. "He’s trying to prove he’s a good lawyer," Finkelstein said. "If you look at the spirit of it, it doesn’t falsify the claim. He’s not responsible for that guy getting the death penalty." Said Jules Epstein, a longtime trial lawyer and a professor at Temple Law, who disclosed that he knows El-Shabazz: "The fact that a former client got the death penalty with a different attorney is no reflection on this lawyer whatsoever." Our Ruling After a critical article was published about him last week, Tariq El-Shabazz released a statement Friday calling reporter Ryan Briggs racist and of publishing fake news. In his statement, El-Shabazz said the article had incorrectly claimed former client Anthony Brown was given a death sentence and that not a single client of his had ever been sentenced to death. Brown was not given the death penalty. He received a life sentence, and City & State PA corrected the error Monday. But a former client of El-Shabazz, Kaboni Savage, received a death sentence. El-Shabazz, however, did not represent Savage in the federal case that led to the sentence. Because he didn’t represent Savage in that case, a spokesperson for El-Shabazz said his claim stands as true. A former trial lawyer and expert on legal ethics agree. But while true in a legal sense, El-Shabazz’s statement needs clarification. We rule the claim Mostly True.	None	Tariq El-Shabazz	None	None	None	2017-05-02T17:43:11	2017-04-28	['None']
pomt-13504	"Donald Trump’s been completely consistent" about his plan for nonviolent undocumented immigrants.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/04/mike-pence/pence-says-trump-has-been-consistent-immigration-v/	Donald Trump made a statesman-like visit to the president of Mexico, then followed that up by a delivering a hard-charging speech on immigration in Phoenix. It left many people wondering if Trump was softening or hardening his immigration policies. That was the topic for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who took questions about his running mate on Meet the Press. Host Chuck Todd pointed out that Trump has been inconsistent on what to do with approximately 11 million people living in the United States illegally, specifically those who haven’t committed violent crime. Trump has said violent criminals should be deported, a position that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton also holds. Todd noted that Trump’s position on what to do with nonviolent immigrants isn’t clear. "I think Donald Trump’s been completely consistent," Pence countered. "And I think he did answer the question." Todd pressed Pence with more questioning, noting that Latino leaders were concerned about Trump’s policies and what they actually were. But Pence didn’t directly answer. We looked in depth at Trump’s statements about the undocumented and found that Trump’s answers have not been consistent. At times Trump has been vague, and at other times he’s contradicted himself. His current position seems to be one of wait and see. No official position Before he jumped into the presidential race, Trump seemed to advocate for a pathway to citizenship, not deportation, and repeatedly implied that immigration reform was "what’s right." But he warned that it wouldn’t help the Republican Party. "Every one of those (11 million) votes goes to the Democrats. Now with that, you have to do what’s right, you have to do what’s right. It’s not about the votes necessarily," he said in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference of 2014. "So with immigration, you better be smart and you better be tough." As a presidential candidate, Trump has advocated the "return of all criminal aliens," detention of those crossing the border and enhanced penalties for visa overstays. (Snapshots show his position page hasn’t changed since September 2015, when his campaign website launched.) But the position page makes no mention of the undocumented population at large and, in comments throughout this election, he’s floated several different proposals. Let’s run through them. Proposal No. 1: ‘Have to give them a path’ A few days after he announced his candidacy, Trump suggested he was open to a pathway to citizenship. "You have to give them a path, and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. But the bad ones, you have to get them out and get them out fast," Trump said in a July 3, 2015, press conference. Proposal No. 2: Mass deportations and expedited legal return During most of the GOP primary, Trump consistently advocated for deporting all undocumented immigrants, but allowing some to return through an expedited legal process. He didn’t give details on how he would pay for and implement the deportations, but remained committed to his position and criticized primary opponents for being weak on the issue and promising "amnesty." Here are some examples of comments Trump made during that period: • Sept. 27, 2015, CBS: "If they’ve done well, they’re going out and they’re coming back in legally. ...We’re rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they’re going to be happy because they want to be legalized." • Nov. 11, 2015, MSNBC: "You’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely. ... Now they can come back but they have to come back legally." • Feb. 25, 2016, CNN/Telemundo GOP primary debate: "We either have a country, or we don’t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back — some will come back, the best, through a process." Proposal No. 3: No mass deportations and ‘we work with them’ After winning the GOP primary, Trump seemed to walk back his previous calls for removing all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants. He told Bloomberg in a June 2016 interview that his immigration policies would have "heart." Pressed to clarify his earlier deportation position, he said, "No, I wouldn’t call it mass deportations. … We are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here, that I can tell you." "I never liked the media term ‘mass deportation’ — but we must enforce the laws of the land!" he tweeted the same day. Trump reiterated this position in a Aug. 23 Fox News town hall. Asked whether he would accommodate law-abiding undocumented immigrants with families, he said, "There certainly can be a softening, because we’re not looking to hurt people, we want people — we have some great people in this country. We have some great people in this country. So, but we’re going to follow the laws of this country." In a follow-up town hall that aired a night later, Trump asked his supporters to indicate via applause what he should do with the noncriminal immigrants: "No. 1, we’ll say throw them out. No. 2, we work with them." "They’ll pay back taxes. They have to pay taxes. There’s no amnesty," Trump said following the voice vote. "But we work with them. ... Everywhere I go, I get the same reaction. They want toughness. They want firmness. They want to obey the law. But -- but they feel that throwing them out as a whole family when they've been here for a long time -- it's a tough thing." Proposal No. 4: Possible pathway to legal status and possible mass deportations The same day as his second Fox News town hall, Trump insisted he hadn’t changed his position. He talked about granting legal status provided the undocumented immigrants leave the United States first, but also suggested there’s a "very good chance" he’ll deport them. "You can’t take 11 (million) at one time and just say, ‘boom, you’re gone.’ We have to find where these people are. Most people don’t even know where they are," he said to CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Aug. 26. "I don’t think it’s a softening. I’ve had people saying it’s a hardening, actually. ... We’re going to deport many people, many, many people." Given that the vast majority of the undocumented immigrants are not criminals, Cooper asked, would they be able to gain legal status? "Unless people leave the country — well, when they come back in, if they come back in then they can start paying taxes," Trump responded. "But there is no path to legalization unless they leave the country and come back." When pressed on whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who haven’t committed a crime, Trump said, "We’re going to see what happens. But there's a very good chance the answer could be yes, but there's no legalization. There's no amnesty. If somebody wants to go the legalization route, what they'll do is they'll go leave the country, hopefully come back in and then we can talk." Proposal No. 5: Deportations prioritizing criminals, visa overstays and ‘public charges’ In his Aug. 31 Phoenix, Ariz., speech outlining his immigration policy, Trump reiterated that legal status would only be granted to undocumented immigrants who "return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else." As for deportations, Trump suggested the threat would always loom, but the focus wouldn’t be on law-abiding undocumented immigrants. "Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation," he said. "Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration." Proposal No. 6: ‘Assess the situation’ A day after his speech, Trump suggested his mind wasn’t quite made up, and that he’d have to see which undocumented immigrants remained after all his policies had been implemented. "We're going to sit back, we're going to assess the situation," Trump said on Fox News. "We're going to make a decision at that time. I want to see, before we do anything further, I want to see how it shapes up when we have strong, you know, I use the word impenetrable borders." Our ruling Pence said, "Donald Trump’s been completely consistent" about his plan for nonviolent undocumented immigrants. Trump has been consistently vague about his policies for undocumented immigrants who live in the United States and largely obey the law. He’s advocated for mass deportations and then rejected mass deportations before saying there’s a "very good chance" they would happen. He’s said "you have to give them a path" but rejected "amnesty" and then said legal status could be granted to those who leave the country first and apply for reentry.

pomt-10783	"John Edwards never -- has ever from the beginning of his political career has never taken PAC money or the money of Washington lobbyists. Ever." -Joe Trippi, senior campaign adviser	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/16/john-edwards/not-really-never-ever/	This would seem to be an impossible standard to meet. Never, ever, ever? Um, no, not never, ever. The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan research group that tracks money in politics, found that Edwards accepted $14,900 from employees at lobbying firms through June. In 2004, records show that Edwards received $30,630 from lobbying employees, and in 2002, he took in $4,700 from that group. While those numbers pale in comparison to other top-tier candidates -- Hillary Clinton received $427,950 from lobbyists, McCain $287,150 -- they still contradict Trippi's comment, right? Not so fast. The spokesman for the center, Massie Ritsch, said those figures include lobbyist donors to Edwards that actually are registered to lobby at the state or local level. That distinction is an important one to Edwards. When his campaign says Edwards accepts no lobbyist money, they mean only federal lobbyists, not lobbyists registered elsewhere. "The people who are federal lobbyists are paid to influence federal lawmakers," said Colleen Murray, an Edwards spokeswoman. "You get into the area where somebody's offering their support to get something down the road." If this sounds familiar, it is. Sen. Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, has made similar claims about his aversion to federal lobbyist money, while defending his right to collect cash from other influence-seekers. The Federal Election Commission and Ritsch both vouch for the claim this year that Edwards doesn't take money from Political Action Committees. But according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Edwards did get $2,000 in PAC money in 2004. Of course, out of a total of $33-million he raised that year, what's $2,000? "In the grand scheme of things, I wouldn't even mention it," said Ritsch. To weed out Washington lobbyists, the campaign requires donors to check a box declaring that they're not federal lobbyists. In addition, campaign staff cross-checks donor names with the federal lobbying registry. If they see a match, they'll return the donation. It's not perfect. For instance, the campaign returned $3,700 in July after the Associated Press found that lobbyists had contributed. The AP later reported that of 25,000 individual donations recorded in finance reports, 8,400 didn't name their occupation. The Charlotte Observer found four contributors in September that were Washington lobbyists who hadn't received refunds. Subsequently, the Edwards campaign refunded those, too. The AP reported in 2004 that Edwards accepted thousands from individuals or groups registered to lobby in Washington, or their spouses or children. Murray said the campaign is taking precautions this year, but it can be difficult —and in some cases unfair — to prevent relatives of lobbyists from giving. "That's a real gray area," she said. "Who's to say that a lobbyist's wife who is a school teacher and wants to give shouldn't be allowed to do so?" And while lobbyists are shunned, special interests aren't. Edwards leads all candidates through June 2007 in contributions from lawyers, receiving $6.6-million. Aren't lawyers, including the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, lobbyists? "Sure they're lobbyists," Ritsch said. "Just because you're not a federally registered lobbyist doesn't mean you don't want something in return. If candidates for office returned every dollar from people who wanted something from them, they wouldn't have any money left." But the Edwards campaign is sticking to its claim. As Trippi told Chris Matthews: "Trial lawyers, teachers, they may hire lobbyists. But they don't lobby. The lobbyists are the people who have to register as lobbyists." If the claim had been even a little less absolute, a little less ironclad, we would have seen it as 'True,' given the effort the campaign makes to weed out registered lobbyists. But the best we can do is meet Edwards half-way on this one. Half-True.	None	John Edwards	None	None	None	2007-10-16T00:00:00	2007-09-20	['Washington,_D.C.', 'John_Edwards']
pomt-02317	"Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/30/heidi-heilman/marijuana-legalization-opponent-heidi-heilman-says/	Editors note: This item was revised on April 1, 2014 to reflect the fact that increases of 300 and 800 percent represent four- and nine-fold increases respectively. The ruling remains the same. In the debate over whether marijuana should be legalized, one issue is the question of potency. Critics of legalization argue that the street drug now available for sale is not the marijuana that a lot of baby boomers and Generation Xers have used. One of them, Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, raised the issue March 13 in a commentary in The Providence Journal. "Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear," she wrote. "Such dangerous levels of THC heighten mental illness and addiction risks for those who smoke marijuana — especially for kids with developing brains." THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, available by prescription, is the key active ingredient in marijuana. It's well established that the potency of marijuana has increased over time. On Jan. 24, PolitiFact national ruled that when former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy said that marijuana today is "genetically modified," with THC levels that "far surpass the marijuana" of the 1970s, his statement was Mostly True. Heilman was being more specific. Because something 100 percent more potent is actually twice as potent, she was saying that the potency of today's marijuana is now four to nine times greater than "yesteryear," a rather vague starting point. Nonetheless, we wanted to see if her statement was on target or her statistic was a bit high. Heilman was quick to send us several pieces of information. The first was a graph showing a rapid increase in potency from 1960 to 2011, a 52-year span. It shows the ratio of THC in marijuana going from 0.2 percent to 11.4 percent. That's an increase of 5,700 percent, well outside the range cited by Heilman. But are those numbers reliable? The graph says the information came from a study in the Journal of Forensic Science. But that study was published in 2010, and only covered a 16-year period that ends in 2008. Its authors, researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, examined 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. They found that the THC concentrations of marijuana had risen by about 171 percent in that time period, well below the 300 to 800 percent increase cited by Heilman. We also contacted the Drug Enforcement Administration in Boston and Washington and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. They referred us back to the research center at Ole Miss, which has been monitoring THC content at least since the early 1970s. The researchers there sent us copies of their reports, all published in the journal, along with test results that included the most recent data. We also secured some of their quarterly reports. We found that even though the report Heilman cited didn’t back up her claim, the Ole Miss data did.

That would be 300 percent higher (or four times stronger) than 1992 levels, when the average was 3.08 percent. And it would be 800 percent higher (or nine times stronger) than the average level of 0.98 percent found in 1976. How high could the THC content potentially go? One specimen, seized on Sept. 11, 2007, was found to have a THC content of 37.2 percent. Our ruling Heidi Heilman said, "Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear." Long-term testing shows that, on average, today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than grass seized in 1976 and earlier. We rate her claim as True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-00623	Says Democratic challenger Russ Feingold "was the deciding vote on Obamacare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/27/ron-johnson/russ-feingold-cast-deciding-vote-pave-way-obamacar/	Shortly after Democrat Russ Feingold announced he would challenge U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016, setting up a rematch from six years earlier, Johnson outlined how he would define the former three-term senator. Feingold is a builder of big government, a career politician and a Washington insider, Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in an article published May 19, 2015. And the first-term Republican pledged: "I’ll point out Sen. Feingold was the deciding vote on Obamacare. That’s not working out so good for Wisconsinites." The deciding vote on Obamacare? The same claim has been made against a number of other Democratic senators over the past five years. Our colleagues have checked five of them -- four were rated Mostly False and one False. But does the claim apply to Feingold? The vote All of the claims center on the penultimate vote in the Senate to approve President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The vote, taken Dec. 23, 2009, was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the health care reform bill itself could proceed. Without that move to prevent Republican filibusters, a final vote on the bill would have been blocked. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes -- and the Democrats got exactly 60. All 58 Democratic senators, including Feingold, along with two independents voted yes. The next day,the Senate passed Obamacare. Obama signed the measure into law in March 2010. Johnson's spokeswoman, Melinda Schnell, argued to us in an email that all 60 votes for cloture were decisive, because any one of the senators "could have, on her or his own, stopped the measure by voting otherwise." Yes. But Johnson's claim is that Feingold cast the deciding vote, not one of 60 votes. So was there a single deciding senator? Arguably yes, but not Feingold. Four days before the cloture vote was held, Senate Democrats announced they had clinched the 60th vote they needed by reaching a compromise with Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, who had concerns about abortion-related provisions in the bill. Nelson even appeared at a news conference to explain his position. Earlier in the process, according to a detailed recounting by the Los Angeles Times, reluctant Democratic Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, as well as Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, were persuaded to vote yes. In contrast, based on accounts in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times and the Boston Globe -- there is no mention that Feingold's vote for cloture was ever in doubt. And Johnson didn’t cite any evidence that it was. A footnote before we close: A week before the Obamacare cloture vote, Feingold played a pivotal role on a different cloture vote. Republicans threatened to filibuster an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the Obamacare measure. To get around that, according to the Los Angeles Times, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had to convince Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill -- not to join the Republican blockade. Feingold agreed to vote with his party. The effect was to advance the health care bill. Our rating Johnson said Feingold "was the deciding vote on Obamacare." There is an element of truth in Johnson's claim. Obamacare backers needed 60 yes votes on a crucial vote in the Senate that paved the way for final Senate passage of the health care reform bill. Feingold cast one of those votes. But to call it the deciding vote is misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt. We rate Johnson's statement Mostly False.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2015-05-27T05:00:00	2015-05-19	['Russ_Feingold', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-07315	Says the Texas Board of Nursing has a backlog of "3,000 complaints against nurses, many of them sexual assaults, malfeasance."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/16/john-whitmire/state-sen-john-whitmire-says-texas-board-nursing-h/	Explaining why he couldn’t support the Texas Senate’s version of the 2012-13 state budget, Sen. John Whitmire said he didn’t know how state agencies can cope with further budget cuts, singling out the Texas Board of Nursing as an example. "I asked them for their backlog of investigations," he said. "They’ve got 3,000 complaints against nurses, many of them sexual assaults, malfeasance." Time to crank up the Truth-O-Meter, starting with the board’s unresolved complaints. Some background: The board investigates and adjudicates complaints about Texas nurses who could be violating the Nursing Practice Act, which imposes regulations on nursing education, licensing and practices in the state including rules against unnecessarily exposing patients to the risk of harm or failing to adequately care for them. At the nursing board, spokesman Bruce Holter told us the senator’s count of 3,000 backlogged complaints is too low, accounting solely for unresolved cases from fiscal years 2009 and 2010. In 2010, the board resolved 14,429 of 16,890 complaints filed against nurses, leaving 2,461 unresolved cases. As of this March, another 511 complaints filed in 2009 remained unresolved, bringing the total backlog to nearly 3,000. There also are several hundred lingering complaints dating back to May 2006, board officials said. As of March, the board had about 11,000 open investigations, including the backlog. What are the complaints about? "In general," Holter said, "criminal conduct, drug-related conduct and failure to follow the minimum standard of care are the main types of complaints." That covers malfeasance. But what about Whitmire’s other charge — that a chunk of the backlogged cases are sexual assault complaints? Lara Wendler, Whitmire’s chief of staff, told us the senator based his statement on conversations with administrators at agencies, including the nursing board. She added, though, that Whitmire was referring to all regulatory agencies, not just the nursing board, when he said backlogged cases included "many" sexual assaults. That was not clear from Whitmire’s floor remarks. Holter said the board checks all nurses licensed in Texas against state and national databases identifying sex offenders. Currently, the board is investigating complaints against four nurses who appear on the Texas Department of Public Safety’s sex offender database, and 12 nurses who appear on a national sex offender registry kept by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing. "Sexual assault complaints against nurses make up a small percentage of the overall number of complaints investigated by the board," Holter said. But he added that other than the nurses found on the sexual offender databases, "it would be difficult for staff to ‘pin down’ the number of complaints involving sexual assault." Why? The board doesn’t categorize complaints by type, though when disciplinary action has been taken, Holter said, the board can run a data mining program to identify specific rule violations. But because the board doesn't track the number of sexual assault cases, it would have to review each resolved complaint individually. Lastly, why have complaints stacked up? Board employees are barred from discussing the details of individual complaints, but the board’s general counsel Dusty Johnston told us that generally, complaints don’t get resolved for a variety of reasons. He offered several examples: The investigator may be under-performing; extensive due process is required; the medical records of the patient involved in the complaint are difficult to obtain. So, the board says it has about 3,000 backlogged complaints, as Whitmire said. According to the board, many of the complaints allege malfeasance by nurses, as Whitmire also said, and a smaller number involve sexual assaults. But no one can determine the precise breakout without access to confidential board information. We rate Whitmire’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-11723	"New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/14/truth-examiner/new-jersey-police-chief-said-black-people-have-no-/	A former New Jersey police chief made a series of alarming racist comments about African-Americans, according to an article on Facebook. "New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed," stated a Nov. 2 headline by Truth Examiner, a clickbait liberal website that largely posts articles critical of Republicans, including President Donald Trump. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. But in this case, the information is based on actual federal criminal hate crime charge against Frank Nucera, Jr., a former police chief of Bordentown, a New Jersey township. The website attributes the information to CNN, which reported about the case against Nucera. Here’s a summary of the case, according to the federal criminal complaint filed Oct. 31. Nucera frequently used racial epithets against African-Americans and called for violence against them. In or about November 2015, when Nucera suspected that a previously arrested African- American individual had slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera stated to a subordinate officer: "I wish that n----- would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I'm tired of them. These n------ are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow them down. I'd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it." The incident that led to the charges occurred Sept. 1, 2016, when the Ramada Hotel called to report to police that two individuals had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and had been swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon. The suspects, both African-Americans, were an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old woman. The suspects resisted arrest, and one of the officers used pepper spray, but the suspects were ultimately subdued and handcuffed. While the male suspect was no longer resisting, Nucera grabbed his head and slammed it into a metal doorjamb. Nucera also used his arm to strike the suspect’s neck or head. Within hours of the alleged assault, a police officer recorded Nucera making racially hostile statements regarding the suspects and African-Americans in general. Nucera retired as chief shortly after the federal government informed the New Jersey attorney general of the pending investigation. Nucera appeared in court in November 2017. A federal grand jury indicted Nucera on Dec. 7 for allegedly violating a man’s civil rights by using excessive force during an arrest. We contacted Nucera’s lawyer and did not get a reply. In a Dec. 22, 2016 interview with FBI agents, Nucera denied touching the male suspect, according to the indictment. The headline stated, "New Jersey police chief says black people ‘have no value’ and should all be executed." A federal criminal complaint states that Nucera expressed those opinions; the case is pending. Because there hasn't been a final determination made by a court, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05418	Says excessive speculation is pushing up oil prices and a recent report estimates it "adds 56 cents to every gallon of gasoline siphoned from the pump."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/02/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-excessive-oil-speculation-drivi/	When it costs more than $70 to fill up a tank with gas, average Americans are left wondering why? Sen. Sherrod Brown says Wall Street oil speculation is partly to blame and recently called for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to intervene. "We’re seeing gas prices rise long before the peak summer driving season — and excessive oil speculation is a key source of these cost spikes," Brown said in a news release. "In fact, one recent report showed that out-of-control speculation adds 56 cents to every gallon of gasoline siphoned from the pump — and that’s outrageous." Is there such a thing as excessive oil speculation? Does it really boost the pump price of gas by 56 cents? PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. First, a word about speculation in general. All agree that a certain amount in commodities markets is a good thing. Here’s why. Take a soybean farmer. To ensure that he makes a certain amount of money on his crop, he will enter into futures contracts that guarantee a price at harvest time. It’s called hedging. Soybean buyers may enter into similar contracts to protect their interests. In both cases, hedging eliminates the chance of devastating, unforeseen price swings. Speculators, unlike the industry hedgers, never intend to deliver or receive anything. They make their money by correctly guessing the direction the price will go. But to ensure hedgers have plenty of options, the market needs speculators to provide an ample number of buyers and sellers. A rule of thumb is that an optimal commodity market needs 70 percent natural hedgers and 30 percent speculators, said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and former director of the division of trading and markets at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But today, there are more than twice as many financial speculators in the oil markets as there are hedgers, he said, and consequently the spot price of oil has become "unmoored" from actual supply and demand fundamentals. The spot price is what someone pays today for immediate delivery of a commodity. In March 2011 report, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that unrest in the Middle East and the possibility of disruptions to the oil supply added a $10 per barrel "risk premium" to the price of crude oil. Fast forward to this February. Forbes writer Robert Lenzner blogged that if not for speculators, oil would trade at just under $75 a barrel instead of the $108 price at the time. He came to that conclusion using Goldman’s analysis that every 100 million barrels of speculative oil futures adds $10 to the barrel price. After determining that the futures market had 233.9 million barrels of oil under contract by hedge funds and other financial investors, Lenzner concluded that the market was experiencing a price premium of $23.39 per barrel. Extrapolating further, Lenzner said that every $10 increase in a barrel of crude adds 24 cents to the pump price for gasoline. So an increase of $23.39 means the pump price theoretically was up 56 cents. In March 2012, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fanned the flames of excessive speculation even more by reiterating the same 56-cent claim. "Now, before some of you who have an opposing view about speculation get too worked up, let me say unequivocally that markets need speculators," said CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton in a speech in New York. "But like a lot of good things, too much can be problematic. Therefore, it is the excessive speculation that can cause problems, contort markets, and result in consumers and businesses paying an unfair price." Chilton drove home his point by citing an even more severe price swing in 2008, when a barrel of oil topped $147 in June before plummeting to about $30 in December. "There was no justification for such a price swing based upon the fundamentals of supply and demand," Chilton said. "The only good explanation is what many researchers and prominent economists and others have said about the link to excessive speculation." We mention Lenzner and Chilton because Brown’s office cited their comments as support for Brown’s claim. So, is Brown right? Many studies "have concluded that the five year volatility in the price of crude oil is substantially due to excessive speculation in crude oil derivative markets," Greenberger testified April 4 before the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee of the House of Representatives. This excessive speculation sends a false demand signal in the futures market that makes its way to the spot oil market and drives up prices, Greenberger said. In some cases, the speculators respond by purchasing oil on the spot market and holding on to it as prices go up. But a number of very smart people also believe speculation is being unfairly blamed. If the futures market was really dictating the spot price of oil then oil inventories would rise accordingly, but that hasn’t happened, said Nick Loris, an energy policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "What you’ve seen is relatively tight markets," he said. Asia has surpassed North America as the leading consumer of oil. Since oil is a global commodity, the price in the United States is affected by supply and demand elsewhere in the world. Blake Clayton, an energy fellow at the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations, attributes "extraordinarily high" gas prices in the United States to "a global market facing serious strain and historic uncertainty." He points to the natural gas market, where speculators account for 60 percent of the futures market. "Thanks to new drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, the United States is swimming in natural gas, and a glutted market has sent prices plummeting," he wrote. "Speculative traders who recognized that the market was imbalanced have enabled, not prevented, this drop in prices." Lutz Kilian, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, co-authored a report that states the evidence does not suggest speculation has played an "important role" in the spot price of oil since 2003. "Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets." To give you an idea of just how hard it is for many economists to get their head around the issue of speculation, consider what liberal economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman has had to say. In a 2008 blog post entitled "Speculative nonsense, once again," he said futures contracts have "no, zero, nada direct effect on the spot price," regardless of how many investors there are and how much they bet. But the following year he reversed his position. "Last year I was skeptical about claims that speculation was central to the price rise, because what I considered the essential signature of a speculative price rise — physical withholding of oil from the market, in the form of high inventories — just wasn’t showing," Krugman wrote. "This time, however, oil inventories are bulging, with huge amounts held in offshore tankers as well as in conventional storage. So this time there’s no question: speculation has been driving prices up." For the last word, we turn to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service. "Although the relationship between speculation and commodity prices has been studied extensively, consensus has not emerged as to whether speculative trading causes unusual oil price volatility," it states in a recent report. So where does that leave Brown’s claim? There is general agreement among leading experts that speculation does exist and that it could impact prices. No less an authority than Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, agrees with Brown’s basic premise. And Brown correctly cited figures from one source that estimates the impact could be as much as 56-cents a gallon. Lenzner, who made the 56-cent estimate, didn’t used the term excessive or out-of-control and his assessment seemed more like a theoretical, back-of-the-napkin calculation than empirical evidence intended to shape policy. And as is often the case with a subject as complex as the economy, different minds can differ. Other experts and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service aren’t as convinced that speculative trading is the culprit for today’s prices at the pump. And even Goldman Sachs has weighed back into the debate. After CFTC Commissioner Chilton referenced the 56-cent claim, Goldman Sachs issued a statement from its analysts that seemed to suggest they were taken out of context. "To say that ‘speculation’ is contributing to higher oil prices is no different than to say that oil prices are rising on the expectation that the improving world economic outlook will lead to more oil demand and that tensions with Iran could lead to a disruption in crude oil supplies," the statement said. So while there is some consensus that speculation can impact price and there are supporters of Brown’s claim out there, it’s important to know that the full impact of speculation is not a settled proposition. Brown correctly cited one report for the his 56-cent figure. But that others say that factors beyond just speculative trading are at work is additional information that helps provide clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2012-05-02T06:00:00	2012-03-23	['None']
pomt-01103	"Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/11/james-aubin/advocate-says-colorado-received-60-million-taxes-a/	The debate over the legalization of marijuana is a lively one, with strong opinions on either side. In a recent commentary in The Providence Journal, James Aubin, the founder of pro-legalization group Common Sense Citizen, argued for the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island, saying it could boost the state’s sagging economy. He included an impressive statistic about the revenue Colorado was bringing in from marijuana sales. "Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana," Aubin wrote in the Jan. 5, 2015, piece. (The Harvard report he mentioned was "The Budgetary Implications of Drug Prohibition," a 2010 study by professor Jeffrey Miron. He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.) We decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue. We asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate. We pulled Colorado’s tax records ourselves. We added up the monthly figures, from Jan. 1, 2014, when the first recreational marijuana stores opened, through Oct. 31, the most recent report. We determined that the state’s total marijuana tax revenue was about $60 million. The revenue comes from a 2.9-percent retail and medical marijuana sales tax; a 10-percent retail marijuana special sales tax; and a 15-percent marijuana excise tax, plus application and license fees for retail and medical marijuana. In other words, Aubin got his number right. We were curious about where the money went. Colorado tax records show that a portion of the revenue from marijuana retail sales is distributed to local governments where stores are located, including Denver and the ski resort towns of Breckenridge and Telluride, based on tax revenue brought in from marijuana sales in those communities. Denver, for example, received $128,586. Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that tax has generated $10 million for the fund. The monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million. We also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana. One, by Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt, reports that estimates for tax potential from marijuana sales vary widely. States with legalized recreational marijuana sales could see their revenue drop as more states move to legalize. Another story, by Associated Press reporter Gene Johnson, detailed how tax revenues from legal sales of marijuana were being undercut by regular users buying medical or black-market marijuana to avoid the higher taxes. Officials in Colorado and Washington, two of the four states that have legalized sale of recreational marijuana, are considering ways to rein in the medical marijuana system and to reduce the tax differential between medical and retail sales. For the record, Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. In 2013, it decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge. Our ruling James Aubin wrote that "Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year …". Documents we reviewed from the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that total marijuana revenue from taxes and fees was about $60 million between Jan. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014. Of course, this figure tells only part of the story about Colorado’s legalization of marijuana. There are also costs, including administrative expenses and societal costs yet to be determined. But those are beyond the scope of this fact-check. We rate Aubin’s claim as True.	None	James Aubin	None	None	None	2015-01-11T00:01:00	2015-01-05	['None']
pomt-13309	Chris Jacobs "has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York’s largest public corruption schemes"	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/07/matt-tighe/jacobs-did-not-take-money-ciminelli-state-senate-r/	Candidates running for State Senate in Buffalo agree that corruption is a problem in state government. They do not agree on how to fix it. Chris Jacobs, the Republican candidate who currently serves as Erie County Clerk, is pushing term limits for state lawmakers. The Republican majority already supports term limits for legislative leaders, but not members. Amber Small, the Democrat running for the seat, wants to see outside income limited for lawmakers and supports a hefty set of reforms to the state’s campaign finance system. Her campaign is also trying to link Jacobs to the latest string of corruption charges from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. "What shouldn’t be lost in this web of public corruption is that the same candidate plastering Western New York with commercials calling for an end to corruption has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York’s largest public corruption schemes," Small’s campaign manager Matt Tighe said in The Buffalo News. Tighe is referring to three men involved in a federal corruption probe that were named in a complaint from Bharara’s office in September. Louis P. Ciminelli, a Buffalo-area developer was named, along with two LPCiminelli executives, Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler. Candidates in a handful of competitive state Senate districts are using Albany’s corruption problem as a hook in this year's election. Is Small’s campaign manager right about her opponent taking donations from Ciminelli and his colleagues? Who’s donated? Ciminelli and Laipple both donated to Jacobs in his campaigns for Erie County Clerk, the first in 2012. Kevin Schuler has not, according to filings with the Board of Elections. Laipple donated $200 to Jacobs' campaign once in 2012. Ciminelli has given Jacobs three donations since 2011, totaling $5,500. He gave Jacobs $2,000 in his first race for county clerk in 2011 and $2,500 in 2014 when he was up for re-election. Jacobs’ campaign confirmed that Jacobs donated the same amount to United Way when the allegations became public in September. Ciminelli Development Company gave Jacobs $1,050 in the 2014 election for county clerk. Altogether, Ciminelli, Laipple, and Ciminelli’s company gave Jacobs $6,750 between 2011 and 2014 according to filings with the Board of Elections. The donations amount to a fraction of the $300,000 Jacobs has raised in his race for state senate according to the latest filing. None of the accused donated to Jacobs since 2014, though his campaign account for county clerk did give Jacobs a $100,000 head start in this year’s election. He also received donations from at least two political action committees that Ciminelli donated to, but neither has exclusively supported Jacobs. Our ruling Amber Small’s campaign manager said in The Buffalo News that Chris Jacobs "has been financed by the same men who are now facing charges in one of Western New York’s largest public corruption schemes." It’s true that Ciminelli and Laipple have given to Jacobs in the past, but not in the race for state Senate. Their donations account for a small portion of what Jacobs has raised this year and in years past.

pomt-08851	"Over the time that President Obama has been in office, we have lost 2.5 million free enterprise system jobs, and, yet, 500,000 federal government jobs have been added."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/08/pete-sessions/pete-sessions-federal-government-has-gained-500000/	U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, sees a hole in President Barack Obama’s theme that the economy is on the mend. "The numbers are stunning," Sessions said on the House floor July 30. "Over the time that President Obama has been in office, we have lost 2.5 million free enterprise system jobs, and, yet, 500,000 federal government jobs have been added in that period of time. The assault on the common man of this country is unrelenting by the Democrat majority." His criticism came to our attention on that evening’s "PBS NewsHour." The private sector starves while Uncle Sam fattens up? We wanted more information. In support of Sessions’ statement, his office guided us through employment statistics posted online by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Sure enough, between February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office, and June 2010, the number of private-sector jobs dropped from 110.3 million to 107.7 million, a decrease of nearly 2.7 million. In the same period, the number of federal government workers rose from 2,792,000 to 3,171,000, an increase of 379,000. That’s not the 500,000 increase Sessions bemoans. Sessions’ chief of staff, Josh Saltzman, noted that federal jobs totaled about 3.4 million in May 2010, amounting to an increase of more than 600,000 since February 2009--making 500,000 a reasonable estimate of the increase in federal employees. Next, we contacted the BLS for more detail on the employment numbers. What we learned: Nearly all of the uptick in federal workers from early 2009 to June 2010 reflects temporary hires by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is conducting the constitutionally required census of U.S. residents. Nathan Clausen, a bureau economist, provided a BLS report indicating that 6,000 census workers were employed in February 2009, a number that shot up to 564,000 in May 2010 before decreasing to 339,000 in June 2010, according to the BLS. The increase of 333,000 census workers from February 2009 to June 2010 amounts to 88 percent of the 379,000 overall increase in federal workers. Not counting the temporary census workers leaves 46,000 other federal workers added on Obama’s watch. Clausen said it’s not possible to divine from the bureau’s database precisely where those workers were added. We wondered how the non-census increase in federal workers during the first 17 full months of Obama’s presidency compared with the same period in predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency. Under Bush, from February 2001 through June 2002 the federal workforce increased by 16,000 to almost 2.8 million workers — about one third of the 46,000 bump (again, not counting temporary census workers) for the similar period under Obama. Disregarding postal workers, who the BLS advises aren’t paid with federal tax aid, the number of federal workers through most of Bush’s presidency hovered around 1.9 million before passing 2 million in May 2008, according to the bureau. After Obama took over, the number of federal workers reached 2.2 million in April 2009, then dipped to 2.1 million by June 2009 before inching up to top 2.3 million in April 2010. There was a sizable one-month bump, to 2.7 million federal workers in May 2010, though the non-postal federal workforce dropped to 2.5 million in June 2010 and to less than 2.4 million in July. And how does Sessions’ statement come out? He nails the drop in private-sector employment, even slightly understating results. At first glance, Sessions’ figure for the increase of 500,000 federal employees seems solid. However, the 500,000 figure greatly overstates reality because temporary census workers account for most of that increase — a pivotal factor his statement doesn’t acknowledge. We rate Sessions’ statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01811	Florida has the "third most-regressive tax" structure.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/22/nan-rich/nan-rich-says-florida-has-third-most-regressive-ta/	When it comes to taxes, Democratic candidate for governor Nan Rich wants to make things more fair for the little guy in Florida. Rich, a former state senator from Weston, faced a question about whether Florida’s tax system should be changed during a Florida Press Association event July 11 at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. "I think it's a regressive tax base, and when you look at some of the studies saying it’s the third most-regressive tax base -- I don't want you to quote me on that because PolitiFact may get me, I'm not sure if it’s (No.) three -- but I think there are things we need to do to make a more equitable and fair tax structure." At PolitiFact Florida, our ears perk up when we hear rankings that put Florida near the top or bottom. As for her request for us not to PolitiFact her, well, we couldn’t help but take that as a friendly challenge. Studies about regressive taxes Rich told PolitiFact Florida in an interview, "don’t hold me to ‘third regressive.’ .... I did not say ‘third’ definitively. ... We are one of the most regressive." Rich cited a 2013 report by The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, a group that advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. The report concluded that all states have regressive tax systems. It means that state taxes come more from the poor and middle class than from the rich. "Virtually every state’s tax system is fundamentally unfair, taking a much greater share of income from middle- and low-income families than from wealthy families," the report says. "The absence of a graduated personal income tax and the over reliance on consumption taxes exacerbate this problem in many states." The report measures property, sales and excise taxes on gasoline and cigarettes paid by different income groups in each state in 2013 and concludes Florida is "No. 2 of the terrible 10" -- the second most-regressive tax system in the country. (No. 1 was Washington state.) "The No. 1 and No. 2 predictor of a very unfair tax system is not having a personal income tax of any kind and an above-average sales tax, and Florida has both of those things," said Matt Gardner, the institute’s executive director. The report found that for non-elderly taxpayers, the bottom 20 percent pay 13.2 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of earners only pay about 2.3 percent of their income toward state and local taxes. The report gives a nod to one progressive feature of Florida’s taxes: We don’t have sales taxes on groceries. We were unable to find any other entity that included Florida in a state-by-state comparison of regressivity and taxes. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that analyzes tax policy, wrote a report criticizing the institute’s study, but their points were not specifically about the states’ rankings. Instead, they criticized the report for promoting income taxes. The foundation does its own ranking of states in terms of business climate -- Florida placed fifth. We interviewed a few experts on taxes, and they were not surprised by Florida’s ranking when it comes to regressive taxes. "Not that many states don’t have an income tax, so that puts us in a small group that looks more regressive," said University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith. However, he said, " ‘regressive’ and ‘burdensome’ are separate issues. The tax burden in Florida is still very low, despite being regressive." Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, said there are only two taxes that are progressive: the income tax and the estate tax. "States that don’t have the income tax -- they just don’t have that lever to pull," he said. "Sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes run from moderately regressive to really regressive." Our ruling Rich said that there is evidence that Florida has "the third most-regressive tax base," though she acknowledged when she spoke she wasn’t certain if she had the number right. She was close: A study placed Florida No. 2 in terms of its regressive tax base. Florida has a regressive tax base because we lack a state income tax. Though the Tax Foundation criticized the report, it didn’t dispute the states’ rankings, and other experts we interviewed also had no qualms about Florida’s placement. Rich’s number of third place was just a smidgen low, so we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Nan Rich	None	None	None	2014-07-22T17:29:54	2014-07-11	['None']
pomt-10950	Says FBI agent Peter Strzok’s hearing confirmed Republican Congressman Jim Jordan’s theory about how the Justice Department got the Steele dossier.	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/24/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-floats-unproven-theory-about-steele-do/	Did a contentious congressional hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok yield new information? Or was it just political theater? On NBC’s Meet of the Press, conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt said the hearing revealed, for the first time, how U.S. law enforcement obtained a controversial document related to the investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia. But the show’s moderator Chuck Todd seemed skeptical. Here’s the meat of their discussion (Hewitt and Todd interrupted each other several times): Hewitt: "We learned that Nellie Ohr gave the Fusion GPS dossier to Bruce Ohr. That's how it got to the Department of Justice — at the end of the testimony, at the very end of the day, it came up in question." Todd: "It came up in Jim Jordan's head." Hewitt: "In Jim Jordan's head. And it was not contradicted by Peter Strzok. Look, I read this like a lawyer." Todd: "He was told what he couldn't say by the FBI, Hugh." Hewitt: "I believe it showed that. We will find out in the end how it all came together. But it's one investigation. I ask everyone just to wait on everything until the end." Todd: "All right. We'll leave it there. That's all for today. Whew. Thanks for watching." There’s a lot to unpack. Here, we’re interested in Hewitt’s claim that Nellie Ohr, an analyst who worked at the research firm Fusion GPS, passed derogatory information on Donald Trump to her husband, a senior official at the Justice Department. So, did the Strzok hearing reveal that Nellie Ohr was a go-between for Fusion GPS and U.S. law enforcement agencies? No. Nellie and Bruce Ohr The claim Hewitt floated on Meet the Press was first pitched by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, at the July 12 Strzok hearing. The charge centers on two virtual unknowns in the world of American politics: Nellie Ohr, a 55-year-old Russia expert and former government official, and her husband Bruce Ohr. During the 2016 election, Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm co-founded by former journalist Glenn Simpson. Fusion GPS was initially hired by the conservative publication Washington Free Beacon, though it’s better known for its later connection to then-candidate Hillary Clinton. After the Republican primary, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The firm contracted with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, whose memos detailing explosive, though not fully verified, claims about Trump are known collectively as the Steele dossier. During Nellie Ohr’s time at Fusion GPS, her husband Bruce Ohr worked as a high-ranking official at the Justice Department. He is a longtime friend of Christopher Steele, according to a profile in the New Yorker. The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment, and attempts to reach Hewitt, Fusion GPS, Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr were unsuccessful. We emailed Hewitt at two separate email addresses and tweeted at him as well. Nellie Ohr: an alleged hidden link The Steele dossier eventually reached the Justice Department and FBI. These agencies relied on the dossier contents, to some degree, to obtain a wiretap on a former Trump campaign adviser. Jordan’s theory is about how the dossier found its way to law enforcement agencies. Some House Republicans allege Nellie and Bruce Ohr acted as a go-between for Fusion GPS and the agencies. Jordan leveled this charge during the Strzok hearing, claiming Nellie Ohr provided a backchannel. "This is amazing," he said. "So Nellie Ohr works for Fusion, works for Glenn Simpson, and she's giving documents to Bruce Ohr, who’s giving them to the FBI." The next day, Jordan’s House Republican colleague stretched the allegation even further. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested that Nellie Ohr’s supposed handoff of the dossier to Bruce Ohr demonstrated collusion between the Clinton campaign and the FBI. Why does this matter? Jordan and Massie seem to be arguing that a connection to the Clinton campaign would undermine the report’s credibility and show the investigation to be politically tainted. But there’s no evidence Nellie Ohr was responsible for routing the Steele dossier to the Justice Department. Even Jordan’s office seemed to acknowledge as much. His spokesman, Ian Fury, characterized the congressman’s assertion as "a working theory that (Jordan) was trying to establish" during the Strzok hearing. We reviewed Strzok’s congressional testimony and did not see that he confirmed Jordan’s theory. In fact, Strzok’s ability to respond Jordan’s questions appeared to be tightly circumscribed by FBI lawyers. He frequently declined to fully answer questions, citing guidance from FBI legal counsel. Strzok also indicated that he was unable to provide certain information to lawmakers because the investigation is still ongoing. Alternate routes to Bruce Ohr The Strzok hearing did reveal that Bruce Ohr gave the Steele dossier to the FBI. "Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier, reporting from Mr. Steele," Strzork told lawmakers. So does that mean Ohr got the dossier from his wife? Not necessarily. Bruce Ohr and Steele were in contact in 2016. So Ohr could have gotten the Steele dossier directly from its author, rather than his wife. Republicans themselves have documented that connection. Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee said in a February memo that Steele maintained contact with Bruce Ohr during the election. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has also said Bruce Ohr served to "funnel information from Steele to the FBI," even after Steele was terminated as a source around late October 2016. (The FBI terminated Steele for what it considered improper disclosures to the media; Bruce Ohr was later demoted at the Justice Department for failing to disclose meetings with Steele and Fusion’s Simpson, according to multiple reports.) In the weeks after the election, Bruce Ohr met with Simpson, after Christopher Steele urged the Fusion founder to do so. "Chris suggested I give some information to Bruce, give him the background to all this," Simpson told the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. "And we eventually met at a coffee shop, and I told him the story." It’s possible Bruce Ohr got the Steele dossier from Simpson, rather than his wife acting as a go-between. FBI had multiple copies of dossier, from multiple sources It’s also important to note that Bruce Ohr was not the FBI’s only source for the dossier. Steele himself met with FBI officials beginning in the summer of 2016, according to reports. The FBI would eventually receive multiple versions of the Steele dossier from multiple sources, according to an email Strzok sent colleagues in January 2017, obtained by The Hill. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., confirmed he gave a version of the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in late 2016. David Corn, of Mother Jones, has said publicly that he gave the Steele memos to the FBI a week or two after the election in the course of his reporting. As a closing point, it should be noted that the Steele dossier did not trigger the FBI’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. That probe opened in July 2016 based on information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. Our ruling Hewitt said FBI agent Peter Strzok’s hearing confirmed Republican Congressman Jim Jordan’s theory about how the Justice Department got the Steele dossier. Specifically, Hewitt said Nellie Ohr, an analyst who worked at the research firm Fusion GPS, passed derogatory information on Donald Trump to her husband, a senior official at the Justice Department. But the hearing did not establish or confirm that Nellie Ohr was a go-between for Fusion GPS and U.S. law enforcement agencies. There are also several other ways law enforcement agencies obtained the Steele dossier that do not appear to involve Nellie or Bruce Ohr. Hewitt is not accurate in claiming that the hearing confirmed this theory. We rate his statement False.

pomt-03880	"Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/07/linda-finn/state-rep-linda-finn-says-rhode-island-keeps-regis/	Amid the vociferous national gun debate prompted by the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, advocates for tightening gun laws often argue that authorities need to keep better track of weapons and their owners. People must register cars and other vehicles, so they should also be required to register firearms, they assert. In Rhode Island, state Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, has submitted a bill that would do just that. Finn’s bill, H-5573, would require Rhode Island residents to register their guns with local officials and pay a $100 fee per weapon. Failure to do so could result in up to three years in prison and up to a $3,000 fine. Finn says her objective is to give local law enforcement basic information about who owns guns in the communities. "Wouldn’t it be safer for them to know if they’re being called to a home that has a gun in it, or if they’re pulling over a person who has a gun?" she said in a Feb. 26 news release. She added: "Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun." Finn’s proposal drew hundreds of gun owners to the Rhode Island State House who argued that the bill violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and is a knee-jerk reaction that would not solve anything. When we asked Finn about her comparison of campers and guns, she said she was referring to what local authorities can quickly ascertain as they respond to an incident. If a camper such as a trailer or RV were involved in a crime, she said, authorities could quickly determine its owner and other information about it, but could not do the same for a gun because Rhode Island does not allow a central registry of private firearms. We looked at her statement in two parts. First, we confirmed with the state Division of Motor Vehicles that it requires registration of who owns campers used on roadways and keeps such a registry with information that can be accessed by the police. Next, we examined Rhode Island’s gun laws. Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2 say that anyone purchasing a handgun or rifle from a dealer must fill out an application, which is sent to the local police chief or state police for review. If there are no objections, the purchaser gets the gun after a seven-day waiting period. The same statutes require the authorities to destroy the copies of the applications they received after they are reviewed. And Statute 11-47-41 specifically forbids any "government agency of the state" or its "political subdivisions" to keep any list of privately owned guns or gun owners. Rhode Island does, however, have a record of people who receive a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, both concealed and not concealed. A person must apply to the either the state Department of Attorney General or to a local police department, which decide whether to grant such a permit. The Department of Attorney General has a database of permits to carry a pistol or revolver, which must be renewed every four years. As of Dec. 31, 2012, the attorney general’s office had on record 3,403 active permits to carry a pistol or revolver, concealed and not concealed, that its office has issued over the years. The attorney general’s office does not share its database with the police or other authorities because that is prohibited by law, according to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin. Rather, the office simply confirms a permit holder’s information to a law enforcement agency if requested during an individual stop or arrest. The attorney general’s office also does not have information on permits to carry issued by local police departments. Another provision of Rhode Island law -- 11-47-40 -- says all federally licensed gun dealers/sellers must keep a register of sales: dates, purchasers and type of firearm. But gun sellers are not government departments or agencies. Our ruling State Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, said, "Rhode Island could tell you who has a camper, but we couldn't figure out who has a gun." Finn is right in that there is no central registry accessible to authorities for all guns or gun owners in Rhode Island. However, there is a subset of thousands of people who have permits to carry weapons that is maintained by the Department of Attorney General or by local police. It’s far from a complete list of every gun or gun owner and the police can access it only on a case-by- case basis. But that’s enough to nudge the Truth-O-Meter ruling to Mostly True.

pomt-07203	"Over the last 15 months, we've added more than 2 million jobs in the private sector. That's far in excess of what it was in the comparable period after the last recession."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/06/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-current-recovery-beats-job-cr/	On the heels of a disappointing jobs report, Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, shined the best light he could on the administration’s economic record during the June 5, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Two days before his appearance, the government announced that the economy had created a net of only 54,000 jobs in May -- a number well below expectations, and also below the number of jobs created in the previous few months. "I would just emphasize, the president's plan is putting us on the right track," Goolsbee told Amanpour. "Over the last 15 months, we've added more than 2 million jobs in the private sector. That's far in excess of what it was in the comparable period after the last recession." We thought it was worth checking whether the current recovery is strong by historical standards. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source for employment numbers. Between February 2010 and May 2011 -- the 15-month period Goolsbee was referring to -- the U.S. economy created 2.1 million private-sector jobs. By contrast, following the previous recession, the economy actually lost 60,000 private-sector jobs during the equivalent period, which ran from August 2002 to November 2003. So Goolsbee’s statistic was factually correct. But the Truth-O-Meter also gives weight to context, and we think there are some important bits of context that Goolsbee left out. One concern we have is why Goolsbee offered the time frame he did. According to the official arbiter of recessions -- the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan group of academic economists -- the most recent recession ended in June 2009. But Goolsbee’s statistic starts counting eight months later, in February 2010. Why does this matter? It doubles the amount of jobs created during the Obama recovery. "In effect, he's saying let's forget all those bad months and just look at the good ones," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. As we noted, using Goolsbee’s 15-month calculation, the economy produced a net of 2.1 million private-sector jobs. But if you count the full 23 months since the recovery officially began, this number shrinks to 980,000. (Using private-sector jobs in the first place also produces a more favorable number to the administration; over the full 23-month period, only 550,000 total jobs were created, due to major job losses in the government sector.) Our second concern has to do with using the George W. Bush recovery as a point of comparison. There’s little question that the Obama recovery is stronger than the George W. Bush recovery -- in large part because the Bush recovery was so anemic. Not only did the Bush recovery produce job losses during the 15-month period Goolsbee cited, but it also produced job losses over the full 23-month period. Over the first 23 months of the Bush recovery, the economy actually lost 757,000 private-sector jobs and 577,000 total jobs. But comparing the Obama recovery to other recoveries in recent decades results in a more mixed picture. We looked at the aftermaths of recessions that ran from July 1990 to March 1991, President George H.W. Bush; from July 1981 to November 1982, under President Ronald Reagan; and from January 1980 to July 1980, under President Jimmy Carter. The recoveries following the George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan recessions were more notably robust in both private-sector and total jobs created than the current recovery has been. The recovery after the Reagan recession was especially strong, with 6.5 million private-sector jobs created. For additional context, it’s also worth looking at what percentage of the recession-related job losses were gained back during the first 23 months of the recovery. By this measure, the Obama recovery has gained back 12.7 percent of the private-sector jobs lost during the recent recession (and 7.3 percent of all jobs lost in the recession). This is far better than the George W. Bush recovery -- which, as we noted actually produced job losses -- but when it comes to private-sector jobs, the current recovery has been weaker than the three earlier recoveries. You get a similar assessment if you compare job creation statistics during the recovery to the size of the labor force. The total job gain over the first 23 months of the current recovery amounts to about one-third of 1 percent of the size of the labor force at the start of the recovery. Once again, the George W. Bush recovery produced job losses, and the recovery from the Carter recession was also low, at two-hundredths of 1 percent. But the recoveries from the Reagan recession (6.1 percent of the labor force) and the George H.W. Bush recession (1.1 percent) were significantly stronger than the current recovery. Where does this leave us? Goolsbee’s facts are correct -- job creation during the past 15 months far exceeds the job creation seen in the previous recovery. He compared the current recovery only to the prior one, which was easily the weakest in recent U.S. history. But while this is somewhat misleading, Goolsbee was careful to make a very specific claim. More worrisome is that he used cherry picking to help make his point. He ignored the first eight months of the current recovery, in which a significant number of jobs were lost. On balance, we rate Goolsbee's statement Mostly True.	None	Austan Goolsbee	None	None	None	2011-06-06T17:22:30	2011-06-05	['None']
pomt-08079	Says Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood will "force you to stop using your cell phone" while driving.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/18/lars-larson/government-going-pry-your-cell-phone-phone-your-co/	Portland radio personality and blogger Lars Larson isn’t likely to add Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to his "friends and family" list anytime soon. Not when, as Larson suggests in a Nov. 21, 2010, post on the conservative website OregonCatalyst.com, LaHood is "going to force you to stop using your cell phone." What? I’m sorry, you’re breaking up. Can you find a stronger signal and say that again? Larson wrote the post five days after LaHood appeared on the MSNBC show Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2010. On the show, LaHood talked about the dangers of distracted driving and how cell phones, smart phones, iPods and other devices have become major contributors to the problem. During the conversation, LaHood was asked about "slamming" technology that would render cell phones useless. "Simply banning talking on a cell phone behind the wheel is not enough for him," Larson wrote. "He’s on MSNBC saying, ‘I think it will be done. Scrambling technology is there and I think you are going to see the technology become adaptable to disable cell phones. We need to do a lot more if we are going to save lives.’" "Ready for Nanny State LaHood to be driving behind the wheel with you? He’s not only telling you that you can’t use your cell phone but he’s going to disable it so that it won’t work," Larson wrote. Larson wasn’t alone in this charge. A large group of mostly conservative commentators constructed an assortment of conspiracy theories after hearing LaHood. Here’s the exchange on Morning Joe that touched it off: Co-host Mika Brzezinski: "So, Secretary, everything you said is true. Everybody does it, everybody’s on the phone. If you look around my neighborhood, all the moms are trying to pick up kids, they’re on their phones, they’re trying to pick up other kids, it happens. Isn’t the only way to stop this, is to have a device in the car, when that car is on, a ‘slammer.’ Literally, the ‘phone slammer’ starts and phones don’t work. Isn’t that the only way to stop it?" Secretary LaHood: "There’s a lot of technology out there now that can disable phones and we’re looking at that. A number of them [cell technology innovators] came to our Distracted Driving Summit here in Washington and presented their technology, and that’s one way. But you have to have good laws, you have to have good enforcement, and you have to have people take personal responsibility. That’s the bottom line." LaHood’s comments admittedly left room for interpretation and confusion, sort of like talking to someone with a weak signal and hearing every third word. LaHood and his aides apparently realized this, too. Two days later LaHood clarified his comments on the department’s blog. "Again, personal responsibility – that’s the bottom line," LaHood wrote in a Nov. 18, 2010, entry titled "Setting the Record Straight" on Fast Lane, "the official blog of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation." "When you get behind the wheel of a 5,000 pound automobile, you have a personal responsibility to drive that vehicle safely. That means, put away cell phones and other devices that take your focus off of the road." Timing is important, however. The clarification came three days before Larson’s entry on OregonCatalyst. Ignored in the jousting is this central -- and unchallenged -- fact: Distracted driving is a major threat to safety. It’s also beyond question that young and inexperienced drivers are especially at risk. Here are some facts: In 2008, almost 20 percent of all crashes involved some type of distraction. (Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration - NHTSA). Nearly 6,000 people died in 2008 in crashes involving a distracted driver, and more than half a million were injured. (NHTSA) The younger, inexperienced drivers under 20 years old have the highest proportion of distraction-related fatal crashes. Drivers who use hand-held devices are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves. (Source: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) Using a cell phone while driving, whether it’s hand-held or hands-free, delays a driver's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit of 0.08 percent. (Source: University of Utah) Given that reality, LaHood says, his department is always on the lookout for new approaches and technology to minimize the danger. Some of those technologies are being studied by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Banning cell phone use in cars by way of "slamming technology" is not on the list and will not be considered, LaHood and his aides say. That leads to an obvious question. "Some have asked why NHTSA would research this kind of technology if there was no intent to put it into use," Department of Transportation press secretary Olivia Alair said in an e-mail exchange. "The reality is, many independent researchers and innovators have approached the DOT with technologies they’ve designed to prevent distracted driving. NHTSA needs to evaluate these kinds of technologies in large part because they may one day wind up on the market – geared towards parents who want to install them in their teens’ cars for example – and it’s important for NHTSA to know how they work, whether they are safe, and whether they help or hurt efforts to stop distracted driving." But, she adds, "We have never promoted the use of technologies to disable cell phone signals, nor have we ever indicated we intended to require them." Larson could be forgiven for jumping to the wrong conclusion if his comments appeared the same day LaHood spoke -- or even the next day. But saying the federal government is moving to cripple your phone three days after the record was clarified to the contrary is dubious no matter how well your smart phone is working. For that reason, we rate his claim False. Comment on this item.	None	Lars Larson	None	None	None	2010-12-18T06:00:00	2010-11-21	['Ray_LaHood']

Barack Obama’s preparedness to be president, Gov. Sarah Palin used Sen. Joe Biden’s own words against him. As Biden and Palin debated records on Iraq during the St. Louis debate, Palin noted, “You also said that Barack Obama was not ready to be commander in chief.” Indeed Biden did. In an Aug. 19, 2007, debate among Democratic hopefuls, moderator George Stephanopoulos pressed Biden whether he stood by a recent quote that Obama was “not ready” to be president. Biden said he stood by it. It’s worth noting that in May 2008, Biden changed his tune. “He’s learned a hell of a lot,” Biden said. Still, he said what he said.

pomt-15276	The National Technical Information Service spends millions of taxpayer dollars to print and sell government documents that are available free in online searches.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/28/david-perdue/perdue-hits-mark-agencys-redundancy/	Don’t worry if you have never heard of the National Technical Information Service. You can look it up online. That’s a big part of the point of Senate Bill 1636, the Just Google It Act. It would eliminate that obscure office within the U.S. Commerce Department. The office’s mandate, as of its 1950 creation: serve as the main repository for government-funded technical, scientific and business reports. The agency estimates it holds more than 3 million documents across some 350 topics. But its own website encourages users to check with other government agencies and conduct an Internet search before requesting documents. Why? The answer is in the numbers. By comparison, the first Google index of the Internet in 1998 had 26 million pages. By 2000, there were 1 billion pages. And Google isn’t charging money for many of the same documents that the NTIS is charging taxpayers to catalog and print. "Georgians are frustrated by the federal government because it is plagued by wasteful spending and redundancy, and the National Technical Information Service is a perfect example of both," U.S. Sen. David Perdue, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a press release. So, is the government spending an estimated $170 million a year of taxpayer money to make documents publicly available when a search engine does it for free? We decided to check. GOVERNMENT 101 Take an introductory political science course (and hopefully a high school civics class) and you learn government’s role in providing services. Part of the theory around all that is government’s role in providing what may have social value but not necessarily earn a profit. Spreading the costs among all citizens in the form of taxes is how government provides things such as a military on the national level and schools on the local level. Government watchdogs, though, have for years questioned spending on services where private-sector competition could lower taxes on everyone. Toll roads, anyone? But not everything that seems wasteful turns out to have no value. Consider the National Helium Reserve. The federal government set it up in 1925 to act as a strategic supply for dirigibles back when the U.S. worried about German airships in battle. It served as a punch line through the decades, including during a 2013 congressional vote to extend the program. But the jokes belied why it still exists. Helium became an important coolant during the Space Race and, later, a key way to keep computers and other technology contaminant-free, all during a time when the private sector was unable to meet demand. So, could the National Technical Information Service be a similar program that sounds ridiculous but actually is not? THE NTIS The Government Accountability Office looked at that very question in 2012. After examining the agency’s organization, function, staffing levels, demand for reports and work, the GAO found that 74 percent of the NTIS reports between 1990 and 2011 were "readily available" elsewhere, usually from the originating agency’s website. And 95 percent of that 74 percent of reports were free, the GAO estimated, while the NTIS lost an average of $1 million a year for the past decade. "In looking across the years, at one point they were self-sustaining as a repository," said Valerie C. Melvin, director of the GAO’s Information Management and Technology Resources Issues Office. "But we found it was not able to sustain itself with the demand and sale of reports in recent years and suggested Congress look at the viability of its statutory function," she said. Melvin testified to those findings about a dated business model before the U.S, Senate in 2014. NTIS Director Bruce Borzino countered in his own testimony that his office is the one posting many of those reports to the Web. And many other federal departments do not have the technical expertise to maintain the permanent access of their information. A spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the office also "tags" much of the agencies’ documents – effectively making them available for Google and other search engines to find them. Some 800,000 documents also are available for free that way, spokeswoman Gail Porter said. "As NTIS evolves, its service portfolio will continue to grow by supporting the entire data delivery pipeline for trusted data networks with stringent privacy and security with a focus on increasing access to data, combining data in new ways and delivering better service," Porter said. It will be up to Congress to take the information from the NTIS and GAO and decide what’s next. Last spring Sens. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican, introduced the Let Me Google That for You bill that would have gutted the NTIS but not killed it outright. That effort cleared the Senate but stalled in the House, opening the door for the bill that Perdue is now co-sponsoring. Perdue’s spokeswoman said Georgia’s freshman senator felt the new bill acknowledges that many government agencies already put their reports online – showing why NTIS is redundant. The bill also would give the Commerce Department a year to phase out the office, so that any "critical functions" can be shifted to another division or agency as needed. "It’s outlived its original intent, especially now that every government agency has a website that is, or should be, more accessible and searchable for public records," Perdue spokeswoman Megan Whittemore said. Government watchdogs have kept an eye on the debate but rarely lobbied one way or the other. The GAO report, after all, shows that the NTIS often has the older reports that are harder to find online. And it shows value in the expertise to make sure documents are posted online for search engines to find. But Steve Ellis, the vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Congress might be better served making it clear that every government department must start doing that work itself. "The question isn’t about NTIS, but why there are still agencies not putting up their own documents," Ellis said. "Just like how we all went from getting a paycheck to using Direct Deposit, the government has to evolve with the times." OUR RULING U.S. Sen. David Perdue said a small government office is spending taxpayer money to print and sell government reports that are available online for free. A 2012 GAO report backs up some of that claim, finding that three-quarters of the National Technical Information Service’s reports were available online. That number reflects a growing trend of government agencies posting their own scientific and technical reports to the Web, where anyone can search and print them out for free. But the claim ignores the fact that the NTIS is responsible for some of the posting and tagging that make those reports easy to find on Google. Perdue’s statement hits on a popular topic, attacking what appears to be government waste. He’s accurate but ignores some information that adds nuance to the debate. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2015-07-28T00:00:00	2015-06-22	['None']
pomt-02905	Says administrator salaries were increased, "but other school employees were left behind."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/05/portland-association-teachers/are-portland-public-school-teachers-being-left-beh/	The Portland Association of Teachers and Portland Public Schools have been engaged in a tense contract battle for months. Most recently, the two sides turned to mediation to help resolve a number of sticking points. Among those differences is the union’s belief that the raise being offered to teachers is too low relative to what has been given to administrators. In a recent newsletter to members, the Portland Association of Teachers wrote that "administrator salaries were increased to be competitive in the Metro 14; but other school employees were left behind." (Metro 14 refers to other nearby districts that are used as measuring sticks for hours, pay and other benefits.) The note continued: "While the Board and Superintendent are asking you to cap your insurance and add a half hour unpaid to each workday, it is only offering you a 1 percent pay increase this year. Educational Support Professionals in PPS … were only given a 1.5 percent raise or less. Their offer falls short of the increase in cost of living and puts us further behind our metro colleagues. Compare this to what administrators have received. Salaries for administrators went up an average of 3.5 percent with the range of increases generally from 1.3 percent to 7.8 percent on July 1, 2013." There’s a lot in there, but we’re going to focus on this idea that administrators saw their salaries increase while "other school employees were left behind." First, let’s lay out what, exactly, was in the Portland Public Schools contract offer before mediation, because some of what was mentioned in the mailer has since changed. All teachers would receive a 1 percent cost-of-living increase. About half of them would also get raises known as step increases based on their experience level. Those would range from 2 to 5 percent. The part in the association’s letter about an extra unpaid half-hour each day has been taken off the table, according to Portland Public Schools. Two other groups of district employees have received their raises: As the mailer noted, administrators saw their salaries increase 1.3 to 7.8 percent, with an average increase of 3.5 percent. The district gave some other represented employees, such as support staff, a 1 percent raise, plus steps when eligible. We see how, based on these figures alone, one could say that teachers and support staff were "left behind." But, as always, we wanted some context. We knew from previous school funding coverage that administrators had not seen much growth in their salaries over the past few years. We wanted to know how salaries were increasing over the long term. Robb Cowie, a spokesman with Portland Public Schools, had district budget folks work up a five-year salary history for us. Here’s what we found: If the offer goes through, a teacher with no step increases would see about a 5 percent salary increase compared with the 2008-09 school year. Those at the lower end of the pay scale who receive step increases would see about a 22 percent increase. Similarly, support staff with no steps netted an 8 percent increase under their recently settled contract; those with steps (but at the lower end of the scale) got about 14 percent. Meanwhile, nonrepresented staff, including administrators, saw raises that range from 3.3 percent (for an elementary school principal) to nearly 6 percent (for technical positions). So, the district has been treating teachers at least as well as administrators over the longer term -- if not better in some cases. Now, there’s also the question of how teachers and nonrepresented employees are doing relative to their colleagues in other metro-area districts. This was a little tricky for us. The district thinks salaries ought to be adjusted for a slightly shorter work day because Portland Public Schools teachers are contracted for 7.5-hour workdays as opposed to the eight-hour workdays of those in the other districts. The union, however, pointed out that Portland teachers are required to be available for two hours worth of meetings each week. The district confirmed that was true though insisted those two hours aren’t used each week. The union disagreed. In the end, we decided to compare the base salaries with no adjustments. A salary comparison drawn up by Brock Logan, the district’s director of employee and labor relations, shows that the minimum average salary of 11 comparable districts for the current year is about $37,700, while the maximum average salary is $74,650. Portland falls below both with a minimum average salary of $35,886 and a maximum average salary of $73,101. We asked Cowie for similar comparisons for the nonrepresented staff. For the current year, Portland seems to be near the middle or lower end of the Metro 14 pack. With the proposed increases, they’ll wind up smack dab in the middle with most of the positions they showed us, but with some still far lower. Only middle school principals on the high end of the pay scale do slightly better than their peers (they rank fifth). When we started this PolitiFact Oregon item, we spoke with Gwen Sullivan, the president of the Portland Association of Teachers. We asked whether it was fair to say teachers were getting left behind without any of the previous years’ context. She told us that the letter sent out to members concerned only the current bargaining year and that saying teachers were getting left behind was true in that light. "It's talking about this year. It's very clear," she said. "As far as the longer term, we didn't weigh in on that to our members." That brings us to our ruling. Under the contract being offered when the association sent out its bargaining letter, teachers would receive smaller raises than some administrators, steps not included. Additionally, compared to their metro-area colleagues, Portland teachers are coming up short while administrators are pulling even. But, it’s also true that a longer take on teacher salaries show them doing just as well as, if not better, than administrators in their own district since 2008-09 in terms of salary growth. Their statement is partly accurate. After all, teachers wouldn’t see as much of a base increase as administrators under the contract in question, and administrators are doing better when compared with their peers. But to determine whether teachers are truly behind, we think it’s necessary to look at more than one year. The statement ignores the five-year history, which shows that teachers are modestly behind peers in other districts but not Portland Public Schools administrators. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03534	Says El Paso is the "safest city of our size in the nation."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/30/veronica-escobar/el-paso-leader-says-el-paso-safest-city-its-size-c/	Questioning characterizations of the U.S.-Mexico border as unsecured, El Paso’s county judge, Veronica Escobar, said: "When elected representatives from our own state make claims that our border is not secure, they are ignoring the facts. When you look at El Paso, Texas, for example, we are the safest city of our size in the nation." Escobar, a Democrat, spoke during a May 22, 2013, telephone conference call with reporters organized to critique Republican U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas for voting against a Senate committee-advanced overhaul of immigration laws. The conference call was run by the Reform Immigration for Texas Alliance, which describes itself as a "statewide network dedicated to building support for comprehensive immigration reform." Escobar’s reference to El Paso as the nation’s safest like-sized city reminded us of Democratic state Sen. José Rodríguez’s statement in September 2011 that El Paso had been named America’s "Safest Large City" a year after San Antonio, Houston and Dallas had the nation’s highest crime rates. We rated that claim Mostly False; El Paso had low crime rates, but only a local press release had named it the nation’s "safest" large city--and its police department dropped the label. Also, the other mentioned cities did not have the nation’s highest overall crime rates; that was true only in comparison to a few huge cities. Rodriguez had attributed El Paso’s "safest" status to an annual report by CQ Press listing crime statistics for cities with a population of more than 500,000. Similarly, Escobar relied on the 2013 CQ Press rankings for her statement, her county aide, Ruben Vogt, told us. By email, Vogt pointed out a Feb. 5, 2013, press release from the city of El Paso stating that for the third straight year, El Paso had the lowest crime-rate ranking among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000, according to the 2013 CQ Press report. Vogt also listed several news articles, including an Austin American-Statesman Feb. 8, 2013, story, that played up the CQ Press crime-rate rankings. Indeed, El Paso, home to more than 660,000 residents in 2011, topped CQ’s 2013 "Lowest Crime Rate" list for larger cities, which indicates that among 33 cities with 500,000 residents or more, El Paso had the lowest crime rate "ranking" based on FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data for 2011 as released in 2012. Trailing El Paso on the CQ Press list: San Diego, New York, Austin, San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles, Portland, Charlotte, Seattle and San Antonio. On the flip side, CQ Press said, Detroit had the highest crime rate "ranking," followed by Baltimore, Memphis, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.; Houston placed 10th-worst by its ranking. Neither El Paso’s press release nor the CQ Press summary identified the border city as the nation’s safest big city. In CQ Press’s case, that’s on purpose, a spokeswoman told us by email. Before the report’s 2009 edition, Marina Ilishaev said, CQ Press used "safest" and "dangerous" to describe those cities with the lowest and highest rankings by its analyses. "Even though the rankings are still provided," she wrote, "these terms are no longer used because perceptions of safety and danger are just that—perceptions. The data analyzed here are reported crime and population, which together constitute only two factors considered when determining safety or risk of crime victimization." "...We would add, as we do in our methodology section, that we mean by ‘lowest composite reported crime rate’ the largest deviation below the national median in six main crime categories, which are counted equally," she said. Specifically, CQ Press says its crime-rate rankings were derived from totaling each city’s violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault as tallied by the FBI plus the number of property crimes of burglary and motor vehicle theft, all in 2011. Then it follows a "multistep process," CQ Press says, in which each city’s reported crimes in each category are compared to nationally reported crimes per 100,000 population rate and "indexed to create a summary score and ranking across" the six areas of reported violent and property crime. Its overall approach--particularly weighting each type of crime the same--concerns criminologists such as Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who told us by telephone that the crime-rate rankings are "highly suspect as true indicators of safety." By email, Mitchell Chamlin, a Texas State University criminal justice professor, said city-level crime rate comparisons are not particularly meaningful. "Crime is local," Chamlin wrote, and "most criminals work in a very small radius," typically smaller than a city. Separately, the FBI has cautioned against using its statistics to develop rankings. In a 2011 online post, "Pitfalls of Ranking," the agency said: "Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place." Its Unified Crime Report "statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale," the FBI said. By telephone, Blumstein noted that anyone can estimate the relative safety in cities by calculating rates for each crime directly from the FBI’s statistics. At his nudge, we looked directly at the FBI statistics for 2011 to compare rates of violent crime, which includes murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, though we limited our focus to El Paso and nine other cities of 500,000 or more population listed in the 2013 CQ Press report as having the "lowest crime rate" rankings. Results from our sampling: --El Paso had the fourth-lowest violent crime rate in 2011, at 431 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Austin (430), San Diego (388) and San Jose (335) had lower rates. --El Paso had the lowest murder rate, 2.4 per 100,000 residents, followed by San Diego (2.9); Seattle (3.2); Portland (3.4); and Austin (3.5). --El Paso had the second-lowest burglary rate of the cities, 281 per 100,000 residents, with New York (221) faring best. San Jose ranked third (441), followed by San Diego (444). Austin ranked seventh (873). We shared our calculations with Sgt. Chris Mears, a spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, who speculated by telephone that a reason El Paso might have a higher burglary rate than New York is that more local residents possess cars and trucks. "How many people in New York drive their own vehicles around?" Also, Mears said, El Paso’s violent crime rate includes domestic violence incidents, which he said account for about half of the city’s violent crime, an indication there is not much other violence. Broadly, Mears said by email, if the crime-rate results "say statistically El Paso had less victims of crime than other large cities, one could argue for the time period in question El Paso was the safest large city." Our ruling Escobar said El Paso is the "safest city of our size in the nation." This conclusion draws on the latest CQ Press crime-rate rankings, which suggest El Paso has the lowest crime-rate ranking of 33 cities with 500,000 residents or more, a conclusion drawing on 2011 crime statistics gathered by the FBI. But "safest" is not that simple. The FBI advises against using its figures to rank cities. Also, CQ Press stopped attaching the "safest" label to its crime-rate rankings years ago, saying the label conveys a perception rather than a fact. It gave us pause, too, that in 2011, El Paso had higher violent-crime and burglary rates, according to FBI-collected figures, than at least one other large city. We rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-01615	On tax inversions, the Wall Street Journal "surprisingly attacked this tax scheme."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/29/chris-matthews/does-wall-street-journal-really-oppose-burger-king/	Forget what the fast food combo of Burger King and Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons might mean for the North American diet, consider the hit on American tax collections. Certainly that’s what stuck in the craw of Chris Matthews, host of Hardball on MSNBC. When the dust settles, the new company will be Canadian, a move that would change Burger King’s American tax status. On his show Aug. 27, as Matthews turned to his guests, it was crystal clear what he thought of this deal. "Your thoughts now on this stinking idea to sneak out of the United States, sell all the hamburgers you can here, and skip your responsibilities to the American people," Matthews asked. Matthews said this was all a "tax avoidance tactic." And he told his guest his antipathy for it was shared by a most unexpected party, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. "The lead editorial today surprisingly attacked this tax scheme," Matthews said. That would be interesting if it were accurate. But it isn’t. The newspaper’s target was the American tax code. It said the Burger King deal provides "a valuable public education on the need to reform America's noncompetitive tax system." It praised Canada for lowering corporate taxes, and in case anyone missed the point, the editorial wrapped up with the word "dumb." "That word also applies to America's corporate tax code, the reigning world champion in punishing investment and discouraging job creation," the editorial said. We wonder if the editorial’s headline sent Matthews down the wrong path. It chided President Barack Obama for losing his "business front man," Warren Buffett, who put $3 billion into the acquisition. The Wall Street Journal referred to Buffett helping "corporate deserters," but the goal was to further tweak the president. That is Obama’s term for companies that do what Burger King has done. We reached out to Matthews and his producers and did not hear back. Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and former chief of staff for Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, said contrary to attacking the deal, the Journal was saying, "Whaddaya expect, when you put such high tax rates on earnest US companies?" What made Matthews mad goes by the name of a tax inversion. This is when an American firm buys a foreign company and then says it is based in that other country. The American company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign one. While the U.S. operation pays taxes on its profits in America, overseas profits are subject to the tax rates in the new home base. As for where the Wall Street Journal stands on inversions, Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida, said the paper’s view is clear. The Journal "is not attacking inversions," McGill said. "They are pointing out that inversions, in fact, may be a reasonable, practical answer to solving the ongoing inability of the United States to rationalize its business tax system to catch up with the rest of the world." Several advantages Inversions happen because, at least on paper, the U.S. corporate tax rate is higher than in Canada and Europe. The actual rates companies pay will vary, but nominally, the combined federal and provincial tax rate in Canada is about 27 percent, while in the United States, the federal rate alone is 35 percent. For multinational firms based in America, this means that if they brought their overseas profits home, they would see a higher tax bill. McGill said an inversion makes it easier for the new foreign company to move that money around. McGill added that it also becomes easier for the new overseas company to charge royalties and licensing fees to what is now considered an American subsidiary. "This will reduce U.S. income while increasing the foreign corporation’s income. But that foreign corporation will likely be in a low-tax jurisdiction," McGill said. Reuven Avi-Yonah, director of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, said inversion offers another way to reduce the American tax bill. "The advantages from a tax perspective are the ability to load the U.S. company with debt that generates interest deductions that reduce its tax on its U.S. operations," Avi-Yonah said. We should note that while the nominal U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, companies with foreign operations rarely pay that much today. The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, found that in 2010, profitable companies paid about 13 percent in federal taxes. Even without inversions, Kleinbard at the University of Southern California, wrote in a recent article that the fearsome U.S. tax rate is not what it purports to be. There are simply too many ways that multinational American firms can trim their tax bills. "Effective marginal tax rates and overall effective tax rates reach the level of the U.S. headline rate only when firms studiously ignore the feast of tax planning opportunities laid out before them on the groaning board of corporate tax expenditures," Kleinbard wrote. Our ruling Matthews said the Wall Street Journal attacked a "tax scheme" known as inversion. We asked many tax experts to interpret the Wall Street Journal’s editorial and not a single one agreed with Matthews. They said the newspaper was criticizing the U.S. corporate tax code and if anything, it cast the Burger King deal as a sensible response to a dysfunctional tax system. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11687	"Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/29/infowars/suspect-san-francisco-pier-christmas-plot-was-anti/	A criminal complaint against a suspect who the FBI said plotted a Christmas Day massacre in San Francisco focused on his expressions in support of ISIS and terrorism. The conspiracy-minded website Infowars said news reports omitted some of the true political affiliations of suspect Everitt Aaron Jameson, describing him as part of the anti-Trump, radical left crowd. "Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter," stated the Dec. 23 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Infowars article zeroed in on Facebook pages "liked" by Jameson to portray him as a far-left user who "liked" anti-Trump and Antifa groups as well as news organizations such as CNN and BuzzFeed and pro-vegan groups. "Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism," stated Infowars. We found Jameson did show some interest in anti-Trump and Antifa groups (Antifa is a shorthand term for anti-fascists.). But the headline and story failed to explain that his interest in those groups were not relevant to the alleged plot laid out in the government’s complaint. FBI criminal complaint shows allegations against Jameson Here is what happened ahead of the planned incident, according to the FBI criminal complaint filed in California Dec. 22: In September, a confidential source alerted the FBI that Jameson’s Facebook account showed he "liked" or "loved" pro-ISIS and terrorism posts, such as an image of Santa Claus standing in New York with a box of dynamite. Jameson, a recent convert to Islam, had expressed support for radical jihadist beliefs and terrorism, including the Oct. 31, 2017, terror attack in New York City in which a driver used a truck to kill eight people. "I’m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back," Jameson wrote on Facebook. In December an undercover FBI employee began communicating with Jameson, who believed the agent was part of senior leadership in ISIS. Jameson indicated that he wanted to plan an attack similar to the 2015 San Bernardino massacre and the recent New York truck attack. Jameson named the Pier 39 site in San Francisco as his target because it is a heavily crowded area. He asked the undercover employee to provide ammunition, assault rifle and materials to make explosives. A couple of days later, an FBI employee mistakenly called Jameson and he called back the employee’s phone number which had a 202 (Washington, D.C.) area code. Later that day Jameson told the undercover FBI employee he reconsidered the attack. On Dec. 20, law enforcement conducted a search warrant and found an incriminating letter and several guns at Jameson’s home. The letter included one mention of Trump -- a reference to Trump’s recent recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: "You’ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews." Two days later, federal authorities announced that they had charged Jameson, a 26-year-old Modesto truck driver, with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, Jameson faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Jameson’s family said he was depressed over losing custody of his children and insisted he never talked about violence or being influenced by terrorist groups. Jameson’s federal public defender Heather E. Williams told PolitiFact that her office will investigate the possibility of an entrapment defense and whether the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt any attempted criminal act since Jameson ultimately told an FBI undercover employee that he had reconsidered. "In my understanding, the label ‘antifa’ means ‘anti-fascist.’ If being anti-Trump, anti-fascist tends to show a person is more likely to be a ‘terrorist’ than not, the FBI must have a very long list of suspicious people," she told PolitiFact. Jameson’s Facebook page The 11-page FBI criminal complaint and the press release from the U.S. Attorney make no mention of Antifa, and the only reference to Trump is the one sentence in the letter seized at Jameson’s home. Mainstream news accounts of the case mentioned the sentence about Trump but nothing about Antifa. Antifa broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Infowars drew from an archived version of Jameson’s Facebook that showed he liked four Antifa groups -- three in California and one in Portland. He also liked a few anti-Trump groups, such as the "Trump resistance movement." We noticed that Jameson liked hundreds of groups on Facebook ranging from the political ("Sassy Socialist Memes") to food, fashion, TV and sports. We asked spokespersons for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney if the fact that the complaint made no mention of Jameson liking anti-Trump and Antifa means that it was irrelevant from a law enforcement perspective, but authorities declined to answer that question. We posed the same question to a couple of experts on terrorism: Brian Levin at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, and Erin Miller, at the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland. Levin said federal authorities include information in the complaint that is relevant to the charge, which in this case was attempting to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations. ISIS is considered a foreign terrorist organization while Antifa isn’t. "That’s why ISIS ‘likes’ would be factually and legally relevant and the others would not," Levin said. "The focus of his alleged goals was aligned with ISIS and apparently less so than with the other entities which aren’t designated as foreign terrorist organizations." His main interest is clearly ISIS and to suggest otherwise is not wholly accurate, Levin said. "Extremists are not hermetically sealed in freeze-dried containers -- they often dine from buffet of hatred but usually there is one that predominants and that’s what we apparently have here," he said. There is a broad spectrum within Antifa, which includes some individuals who have expressed violence. But an abstract embrace of Antifa isn’t illegal. "Like the anti-abortion movement, ‘Antifa’ is itself an ideological movement," Miller said. "Like any ideological movement, individuals can identify with it. Formal organizations can coalesce within/around it. Either can engage in non-violent or violent efforts to in an attempt promote the ideology/movement." Our ruling Infowars’ headline said, "Pier 39 terrorist was an anti-Trump antifa supporter." Infowars drew from the suspect’s Facebook page, which showed he liked a few anti-Trump and Antifa pages as well as hundreds of unrelated groups. The FBI criminal complaint makes no mention of Jameson liking these groups, which indicates that prosecutors believe his liking of these groups didn’t play any role in the attempted terrorist plot.

pomt-06308	"Torture is illegal by our laws. It's illegal by international laws."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-torture-banned-under-us-internationa/	During the CBS-National Journal Republican presidential debate in Spartanburg, S.C., on Nov. 12, 2011, one of the moderators, Major Garrett, invited Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, into a discussion of torture. Both Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and former Godfather's Pizza executive Herman Cain had already said they favored allowing interrogators to use waterboarding -- the practice of simulating drowning to elicit information from a detainee. Waterboarding was permitted under the George W. Bush administration, but the policy was rescinded soon after President Barack Obama took office. "Congressman Paul," Garrett said, "my fighting sense tells me we have a debate about to get launched here. I know you have an opinion and would like to weigh in." Paul responded, "Yes, torture is illegal by our laws. It's illegal by international laws." The exchange attracted significant attention following the debate. Obama was asked about it at a news conference in Hawaii. He responded that that Bachmann and Cain are among those who are "wrong. Waterboarding is torture. It’s contrary to America’s traditions. It’s contrary to our ideals. That’s not who we are. That’s not how we operate. We don’t need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism. And we did the right thing by ending that practice." Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who ran against Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign, tweeted, "Very disappointed by statements at SC GOP debate supporting waterboarding. Waterboarding is torture." We wondered whether Paul was right that torture is illegal under U.S. and international law. So we decided to check. First, however, we should note that many -- though not all -- observers consider waterboarding to be a form of torture. We’ll address that issue more fully in a moment. For now, let‘s stick to Paul’s specific claim. Is torture illegal under U.S. law? Yes, under several different portions of the law. • A provision of U.S. law (18 U.S.C. 2340) that took effect in 1994 makes torture a crime. The law defines torture as "an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control." • A different provision on war crimes addresses torture as well (18 U.S.C. 2441). The provision reads, "Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death. … As used in this section, the term ‘war crime’ (includes) … torture ..." • Finally, as we noted here, two days after taking office, Obama issued a detailed executive order on torture and related issues. The executive order said that prisoners "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person (including murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture), nor to outrages upon personal dignity (including humiliating and degrading treatment)." It also specifically nullifies interpretations of federal law on interrogations "issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009" under President George W. Bush. The executive order brings the CIA into line with U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation, said said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. This limits interrogators to humane techniques, a standard that already applies as a matter of law to the U.S. military, he said. Is torture illegal under international law? This is also a correct statement. • The Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment of Punishment (the Torture Convention) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1984 and entered into force on June 26, 1987, after it had been ratified by 20 states. The United States ratified the convention on Oct. 21, 1994. It defines torture as "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity." • The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This United Nations agreement -- approved on Dec. 16, 1966, and entered into force on March 23, 1976 -- says in part that "no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." The United States ratified it in June 8, 1992. • The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. This convention entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955. It bars "at any time and in any place whatsoever" all "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture" of "persons taking no active part in … hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause." • Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. This convention, This convention was entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955 and is virtually identical to the separate Geneva convention above. • Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration, drafted by a committee that included former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, is not technically a treaty, but it does carry some weight in international law. It was ratified by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, by a vote of 48-0 with eight abstentions. The United States was one of the nations voting in favor of the declaration, which says that "no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." What constitutes torture? So Paul is on solid ground when he says that "torture is illegal … by our laws. It's illegal by international laws." But as we indicated, there’s a significant caveat -- not everyone agrees on what constitutes torture. "No one will dispute Rep. Paul’s statement," said Steven Groves, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "What is in dispute is whether certain interrogation techniques are considered ‘torture’ under either the U.S. or international definition of that term." This is an especially important point given that Paul’s comment came in the context of a discussion of waterboarding. Many legal experts believe that waterboarding qualifies as torture under many if not all of the legal definitions cited above. But the Bush administration and its supporters strongly disagreed, calling waterboarding an "enhanced interrogation technique" and thus falling outside of the definition of torture. An Aug. 1, 2002, memo by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and another memo dated the same day by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo sought to "set a very high threshold as to what constitutes severe ‘pain or suffering,’" said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. These interpretations were overturned by Obama’s Jan. 22, 2009, executive order. But the controversy rages on -- as the Republican debate in South Carolina demonstrates. We won’t seek to referee this question here, but we do think it’s important to note that some -- though by no means all -- observers would consider Paul’s comment to be a non-sequitur because of their position that waterboarding is not torture. Our ruling Paul's comment came immediately after a discussion of waterboarding, and we’ll note that there is not a consensus that waterboarding constitutes torture. That said, Paul’s statement is 100 percent correct: There is no question that torture is barred in both U.S. and international law. We rate Paul’s statement True.

pomt-08273	Says that the new financial services law requires 358 regulatory filings.	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/09/john-boehner/john-boehner-point-describing-new-regulations-cons/	The morning after Republicans won House of Representatives control in last weeks’ elections, soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio held a news conference where he outlined upcoming GOP priorities for the next Congress. How about those tax cuts implemented under President Bush? He wants to keep ’em! What about the health care reform bill adopted under President Obama? He wants it repealed! The congressman from West Chester was more circumspect when asked about potential changes to a financial services reform package adopted earlier this year, promising merely to exercise oversight over its implementation. The law, signed by Obama in July, established an independent consumer bureau within the Federal Reserve to protect borrowers against abuses in mortgage, credit card and some other types of lending. It also gave government new power to seize and shut down large, troubled financial companies. "I think when it comes to the financial services bill and the 358 regulatory filings required under that bill, that it’s going to require a significant amount of oversight, so that not only will Congress understand, but the American people will understand, just what this bill will do to our financial services industry," Boehner answered. That sounded like an awful lot of regulatory filings, so we asked Boehner’s office where his statistic came from. Staffers pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce website that expresses the group’s dismay with the legislation: "The Financial Regulatory Reform bill doesn't address the core causes of the financial crisis," it says. "Instead, it adds new regulatory agencies to the already antiquated system and grows a bloated, ineffective bureaucracy while leaving critical areas unaddressed, including the future of Freddie and Fannie. The real impact of the bill will depend on its implementation. The legislation requires regulators to issue at least 355 new rules and conduct 47 studies and 74 reports that could lead to additional rules." That’s not exactly Boehner’s number, but it’s close enough. A July 15 news release from the Chamber goes even further, citing a study that says the bill creates 533 required regulatory rulemakings, 60 studies, and 93 reports. A spokesman for Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut confirmed the bill imposes more regulation on Wall Street, but said the committee has not tallied up the exact number. He didn’t dispute Boehner’s statistics.. "These regulations are long overdue," said Dodd spokesman Sam Gilford. "The financial crisis occurred because there were gaps in the regulations." Democrats cite a recent Gallup Poll to explain why Boehner said he’d exercise oversight over the financial services bill rather than seek its repeal. The poll found that six in 10 Americans approve of the legislation, in contrast to the majority that disapprove of 2009 economic stimulus package, the auto industry bailout, health care reform, and -- most of all -- the 2008 banking industry bailout. So, while Boehner’s 358 might not be right on the money, his underlying point is correct. The new law does create a lot of new regulations for the financial services industry. We find Boehner’s statement to be True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-11-09T14:00:00	2010-11-03	['None']
pomt-00262	Says that in Texas, "you can be too gay to adopt" a foster child "who needs a loving home."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/oct/04/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-texas-you-can-be-too-gay-adopt-n/	At a lakeside Austin rally mostly celebrating the potential of Texas to lead the nation, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke made a claim about gay residents being kept from adopting children in need. O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman challenging first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said Sept. 29, 2018: "In this state, with 30,000 kids in the foster care system —a foster care system so under-resourced that recently kids were sleeping on top of or underneath the desks in CPS (Child Protective Services) offices—in this state, they say that under the guise of religious liberty that you can be too gay to adopt one of those children who needs a loving home." We wondered: Can a Texan be "too gay" to adopt a child in foster care? When we asked, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign told us that O’Rourke’s claim was based on the Texas Legislature’s action in 2017 known as House Bill 3859. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, says that groups can decline to provide social services to a person if that person’s beliefs conflict with the group’s "sincerely held religious beliefs." In this case, that would mean that a social service group that arranges adoptions could refuse to allow a gay couple to adopt a child through that group. Critics of the measure say that gay Texans are being refused adoption opportunities. Backers of the legislation and a state agency say the law does not keep any qualified adults, including gay residents, from adopting. We read the law and noticed that it doesn’t explicitly bar services to anyone based on sexual orientation, including adoption. The law says that if a group opts to decline service to someone, the group must direct the person to another service provider or to a state list of providers. Opponents of the proposal—-including Equality Texas, which says it seeks to secure "full equality" for LGBTQ Texans—maintain that the law hastens discrimination based on sexual orientation or other factors. In Texas House debate on the measure in May 2017, the Texas Tribune reported, Democratic legislators warned that the plan would give groups license to discriminate against gay — or Jewish or divorced — parents who want to foster or adopt. A subsequent blog post by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group, that said that under the law, state "contractors who provide child welfare services can discriminate against qualified same-sex couples seeking to care for a child in need—including LGBTQ couples, interfaith couples, single parents, married couples in which one prospective parent has previously been divorced, or other parents to whom the agency has a religious objection." After O'Rourke made his 2018 claim, we reached out to Chuck Smith of Equality Texas. Smith indicated by email that Texas doesn’t prohibit adoptions by same-sex couples. Still, he said, if "you were to ask a provider like Catholic Charities if being just a little bit gay is OK with them, you’d learn that they think that ‘any gay’ is ‘too gay’ when it comes to working with prospective adoptive parents." In that vein, O’Rourke’s statement was accurate, Smith said. "For some licensed providers in Texas, including Catholic Charities, you can be too gay to adopt a foster child," Smith wrote. By phone, Jennifer Allmon of the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops offered a kind of confirmation, saying the conference helps married mothers and fathers adopt. "Catholics believe fathers are men and mothers are women," Allmon said. Allmon also noted the law's requirement that anyone refused a service be referred to other providers. Smith said he’s not aware of statistics or independent research on the extent to which the law "has been used by certain providers to refuse to work with LGBTQ people." Advocates say adoptions not prevented Advocates of the law say it doesn’t deter adoptions by gay Texans. State Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, who authored HB 3859, told us that nothing in the law "would stop a same-sex couple from adopting or serving as foster parents in Texas." He added: "There are existing providers today who place children in same-sex households." Franks was quoted in a May 2017 Associated Press news story speculating that different parents would choose different adoption paths. Frank said then that most adoptions happened through the state’s child protective services agency, which would not be subject to the religious freedom mandate, though outside agencies that receive state funding would be. "My guess is if you have an LGBT agency they’re going to pick an LGBT family, and if you have a Baptist agency they may be more likely to pick a Baptist family," Frank told the AP. "They’re free to do that and should be free to do that." Allmon, who testified in favor of Frank’s measure, suggested to us that the law drove up adoptions. "By allowing faithful engagement for those who are motivated to serve because of their religious convictions, the bill expands the diversity of competent providers and loving, stable families who can help the children of Texas," Allmon wrote. "For example, the Texas Bishops launched a major parish based foster care recruitment and retention ministry, The St. Joseph Ministry, in March 2018. A bilingual parish toolkit has been sent to all 1,300 Catholic parishes in Texas to encourage parishes and parishioners to engage in the important work of serving those involved with the foster care system in Texas." State agency says gay adoptions not deterred A key state agency told us that, generally, a person’s sexual orientation isn’t considered in its placements of children in foster care. Patrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which oversees a website connecting adoptive parents with foster children awaiting adoption, said by email: "While HB 3859 protects the religious beliefs of child-placing agencies and adoption agencies, that DOES NOT mean that a qualified individual cannot foster or adopt – it simply means that person should select an agency that will accept his or her application to foster or adopt." Crimmins said Texas has 133 foster/adoption agencies, some with religious affiliations. "The point is that there are plenty to choose from," Crimmins wrote. In the 12 months through August 2018, Crimmins said, 5,636 children were adopted out of foster care statewide. As of September 2018, he said, 3,811 children in foster care needed an adoptive parent. Crimmins said the agency keeps no count of private adoptions. Our ruling O’Rourke said at an Austin rally that in Texas, "you can be too gay to adopt" a foster child "who needs a loving home." Contrary to the implication in O'Rourke's statement, Texas has no law against adoption by gay parents. LGBTQ Texans can, and do, become adoptive parents through any number of processes. Still, O'Rourke is partially accurate in that a 2017 Texas law allows essentially allows faith-based groups to refuse to help gay Texans adopt.

pomt-00331	Says Nancy Pelosi said, "Building a wall will violate the rights of millions of illegals." ​	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/18/viral-image/pelosi-didnt-say-building-wall-will-violate-rights/	A false political meme from 2017 is making the rounds again as the 2018 midterm elections loom. The viral image says that House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, "Building a wall will violate the rights of millions of illegals." The inaccurate quote has overlaid several different images of Pelosi. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The meme first started circulating more than a year ago after Pelosi responded to President Donald Trump’s threat to shut down the government if funding wasn’t secured for the border wall between the United States and Mexico. "The obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall," Trump said at a rally in August 2017. Pelosi issued a statement the next day. "President Trump’s multi-billion dollar border wall boondoggle is strongly opposed by Democrats and many Republicans," Pelosi’s statement read. "Democrats will stand fast against the immoral, ineffective border wall and the rest of Republicans’ unacceptable poison pill riders." After Pelosi’s statement, a meme began circulating with an image of Pelosi and text that said "Building a wall will violate the rights of millions of illegals. It’s not just our country, it’s their country, too!" The text of that meme was copied to other memes that attributed it as a direct quote from Pelosi. We have not found any credible news sources that quote Pelosi in this way, and none of the memes give an idea of where or when she would have made this statement. The meme has popped up a few other times on social media. In January 2018, for example, the government was facing a shutdown, partially because of disputed funding for the border wall. Pelosi posted a thread on Twitter, speaking again in opposition of the wall. The meme started circulating again. Our ruling There’s no credible source that Pelosi said building the border wall would "violate the rights of millions of illegals." The meme started as a rough paraphrase and transitioned to an incorrect direct quote. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05644	Says Lake Erie contains more native fish than all the other Great Lakes combined.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/22/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-lake-erie-has-more-native-fi/	With a newly reconfigured congressional district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, it’s not surprising that U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur would be one of Lake Erie’s biggest boosters. Late last month, the Toledo Democrat marked Great Lakes Week on Capitol Hill with a speech on the House of Representatives floor that discussed the need to prevent voracious Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes and threatening its $7 billion fishing industry. She declared that no lake is more important than Lake Erie, noting that it has the Great Lakes’ largest fishery. Lake Erie "contains more native fish than all the other lakes combined," Kaptur said. "We must protect this valuable ecological treasure, and the local multi-billion dollar economy it supports." Kaptur’s boast about Lake Erie containing "more native fish than all the other lakes combined" sounded like it might be a fish story, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. We consulted Ohio Sea Grant College Program Director Jeffrey M. Reutter, an expert on Lake Erie. He said Kaptur’s statement is largely correct, although there are caveats. He said that Lake Erie always produces more fish than any of the other Great Lakes, and invariably outstrips Lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior combined. Occasionally Lake Michigan produces enough fish so that its total, when added to the other three, exceeds the total produced by Lake Erie. He also said that some of the fish that populate the lakes - such as common carp, as well as salmon and trout that have been stocked in Lakes Michigan and Huron, are not native species. "The point I am a little unsure of is the native vs. non-native portion," he said. "That is a hard one to state accurately because, for example, the common carp, which is very abundant just about everywhere, is not technically a native species and the large salmonid fishery on Lake Michigan is not native." He said that Lake Superior contains 40 to 50 percent of the water in the Great Lakes, but just 2 percent of the fish. Lake Erie contains just 2 percent of the water, and 50 percent of the fish. He said Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes because it is the farthest south, the shallowest, and therefore the warmest lake. Lake Erie also is surrounded by farms and urban residential areas that stream nutrients into its waters. The nutrients feed algae and zooplankton, which feed Lake Erie’s fish. Lake Superior is deeper, colder, and is largely surrounded by forests, so it gets fewer nutrients produced by human intervention and produces fewer fish. "Personally, I would say that she is arguably correct in her statement and let it go," said Reutter. "Congresswoman Kaptur has heard me speak on Lake Erie many times and I am sure she is attempting to accurately repeat something she has heard from me. I would say it’s close enough to be OK." Ohio Department of Natural Resources fisheries biology supervisor Jeff Tyson confirmed Reutter’s observations, noting that the sport and commercial walleye and yellow perch fisheries in Lake Erie far exceed the harvestable fish in the other lakes. White bass, white perch, rainbow smelt, freshwater drum and channel catfish are also found in Lake Erie. Tyson noted that isolated specimens of the Asian carp that Kaptur fears could devastate the Great Lakes have already been found in Lake Erie, most recently in 2003. He said those fish were probably put into its waters as part of a tradition among Asians, in which two live fish are purchased, and one is eaten and the other is released for good luck. "We think these were isolated incidents and have no evidence of an established population," said Tyson. Tyson said that Asian carp eat huge amounts of the same plankton consumed by larval walleye, so their introduction would hurt the walleye’s ability to compete. A Michigan Sea Grant Extension study of Great Lakes Commercial Fisheries bears out Kaptur’s contention that Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes combined, although it did not break out native vs. non-native species. In the year it examined - 2000 - it found that the Great Lakes produced 46.7 million pounds of fish. Of that total, 26.1 million pounds came from Lake Erie, about 56 percent of the total. Lake Erie’s haul included roughly 7 million pounds each of walleye and smelt, 4.4 million pounds of yellow perch, 3.4 million pounds of white bass, and more than a million pounds each of carp and lake whitefish. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission also keeps data on the amount of fish produced in each of the Great Lakes. In 2005, the most recent year for which complete data is posted on its website, Lake Erie’s fish production exceeded that of the combined other lakes by a 3-to-2 margin. There’s no doubt that Kaptur is correct in her overall point that Lake Erie has by far the most productive fishery on the Great Lakes. Her contention that Lake Erie contains more native fish than the other lakes combined is slightly problematic. It’s true that the fishing haul in Lake Erie usually exceeds the combined total of the other lakes. But some fish that are commercial staples in the Great Lakes are not considered "native" because they were introduced from other areas, although their presence isn’t as unwelcome and devastating as invaders like zebra mussels have been, and Asian carp would be.

pomt-01216	"There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of the country."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-foreign-born-residents-living-united/	America’s foreign-born population is already high, and President Barack Obama wants it to grow, former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum said Sunday. Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Santorum criticized Obama’s recently announced executive action on immigration. Obama’s plan could affect about 4 million immigrants currently living in the United States illegally out of an estimated 11 million total. Under the plan, if illegal immigrants meet certain requirements, they will be able to qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for a limited number of years. Santorum warned Obama’s plan will entice more undocumented immigrants, hurting the American-born population that he said is struggling for better employment and wages. "The last 20 years have been the largest wave of immigration in the history of this country," Santorum said. "There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of the country. And what the president is saying is, ‘We need more.’ And working men and women are saying, ‘Hold on, what about us?’ " Obama’s plan only applies to illegal immigrants currently living in the United States, not those who come illegally in the future. Still, we wondered about Santorum’s claim that America’s foreign-born population is the highest it’s ever been. We found that he is correct in terms of raw numbers, but experts say it’s not the best measure to use when comparing America’s foreign-born population over the years. By the numbers We tried to reach Santorum through his PAC, Patriot Voices, but did not hear back. The U.S. Census Bureau provides data for the foreign-born population going back to 1850. As of 2012, the most recent year for which there is data, the foreign-born population of the United States was about 40 million, which factors in the estimated number of immigrants in the country illegally. In terms of raw numbers, that’s the highest it’s been since the Census started tracking it. However, the total U.S. population has grown significantly in the past 160 years. As of 2012, foreign-born residents make up 12.9 percent of the total population. In this respect, today’s foreign-born population is not the highest it’s ever been -- in fact, it was higher from 1860 through the 1920s. Since 1970, when the foreign-born population was 4.7 percent, the trend has been increasing numbers of foreign-born residents. The 2010 percentage of almost 13 percent is the highest it’s been since 1920 and is less than 2 percentage points shy of the all-time high in the 1890s. The following chart, taken from a Census slide presentation, shows the growth of the foreign-born population from 1850 to 2010 in pink bars. The blue line shows their share of the country’s population. Several experts said it is much more useful to measure the foreign-born population as a percentage of the total population rather than absolute numbers. The percentage better reflects the country’s ability to accommodate immigrants. "As a historian, there is no reason whatsoever to focus on the absolute number over the percentage," said Kenyon Zimmer, an immigration historian at the University of Texas Arlington. "The absolute number tells us nothing useful about the impact of immigration on the United States -- an impact that is, today, less than it was during the age of ‘mass immigration’ around the turn of the (20th) century." The percentage measurement gives some context and shows how much of an impact immigrants can have on American society compared to native-born Americans, said Susan Carter, an expert in economics and immigration at University of California Riverside. The higher the percentage of the foreign-born population, the higher their impact on things like labor markets, housing, schools, elections and culture. Thus, immigrants’ impact on American society is lower today than in 1890, when the foreign-born population as a share of the total population peaked at 14.8 percent. The total population was 63 million, compared to 319 million today (with immigrants making up 12.9 percent). "The (total) U.S. population is bigger now than at any time in U.S. history, which means that it has greater capacity to absorb new flows of immigration without adverse impacts," said Madeleine Sumption, research director of international programs at the Migration Policy Institute. Of course, differences in the economic and political situations of 100 years ago and today make it difficult to compare immigrants’ impact in any measure, Sumption said. For example, she noted that government was smaller 100 years ago, so people had lower expectations for a government-funded social safety net for people at risk of poverty, as immigrants often are. Additionally, the United States had few immigration restrictions before 1921, with a notable exception of limiting Asian immigrants, making it difficult to compare immigration trends, Zimmer said. Zimmer added that he believes the number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States is irrelevant to the current immigration debate. As long as there are jobs available, immigrants will come, legally or not. The estimated number of illegal immigrants living in the United States has gone down by about 1 million over the past decade, and that reflects fewer available jobs following the 2008 recession, he said. Carter noted that Americans’ attitude toward immigrants sometimes depends on the economic well-being of the native-born population. She compared Americans’ pessimistic outlook today to that of Americans in the late 1800s. Then, Chinese immigrants were seen as a welcome source of cheap labor, until an economic depression struck in the 1870s, bringing widespread unemployment. At that point, many native-born Americans decided they wanted the Chinese out. "Under such depressing conditions, immigrants become a convenient scapegoat," she said. Our ruling Santorum said, "There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of country." In terms of the absolute number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States, Santorum is correct. However, in terms of the number of immigrants as a percentage of the total population, he’s not. Immigrants made up a bigger share of the total population from 1860 to 1920 than they do today. This measurement is by far the more useful of the two, experts said, as it accounts for total population growth. Whether it’s even worthwhile to compare immigration levels of today with other points in U.S. history is up for debate given drastic economic and political shifts over time. As for Santorum’s claim, it is partially accurate but missing important caveats. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2014-11-23T16:43:49	2014-11-23	['None']
pomt-07569	Since Corey Stewart became chairman in November 2006, unemployment is up 150% and average home price sales are down $150,000.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/30/babur-lateef/babur-lateef-says-unemployment-150-percent-corey-s/	As Republican Corey Stewart contemplates a 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate, he also faces a re-election battle back home in Prince William County this fall for the chairmanship of the board of supervisors. Because of Stewart’s statewide aspirations, his backyard challenge is being widely watched. He is being taken on by Babur Lateef, an eye surgeon from Woodbridge making his making his first bid for public office. Lateef, a Democrat, posted a YouTube video March 26 attacking Stewart’s record. The video says that since Stewart was elected chairman in November 2006, unemployment is up 150 percent in the county, the average price on home sales is down $150,000, 47.4 percent of mortgages are now "under water" and the number of students per classroom in county schools has climbed 40 percent. That’s a lot to chew on, but we’ve got the choppers. This story will examine Lateef’s claims about unemployment and home sale prices. We’ll follow up with a second report. Michael McLaughlin, Lateef’s campaign manager, told us the unemployment figures come from the website of the Virginia Employment Commission, which compiles jobs data for the state and localities. Ann Lang, a VEC economist, helped us pull the numbers for Prince William. In November 2006, the month Stewart was elected chairman and took office, VEC data show Prince William had a 2.2 percent unemployment rate. In January 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available, the county’s unemployment rate was 5.7 percent. That’s an increase of 159 percent, slightly higher than the 150 percent cited in Lateef’s video. We should include a note of caution here. Experts have often told us that politicians get too much credit and blame for the economy. They’ve said that even presidents and governors have limited effects in controlling economic trends. So it seems reasonable that a county board chairman would have an extremely limited impact over a region’s economic performance. Prince William’s economy is closely tied to that of the larger Washington, D.C. metro area, as well as to the state and national economies. Lateef’s video suggests Stewart shoulders blame for the collapse of the financial system in 2008, the rise of oil prices that summer to $140 per barrel and the massive recession that took national unemployment to 10 percent. While Prince William’s unemployment rate has certainly climbed, it remains below Virginia and national levels. In January 2011 Virginia’s unemployment rate was 6.9 percent and the national rate was 9 percent. CNNMoney, a joint project of CNN and Money Magazine, also said Prince William is 17th in the national list of counties that have seen the most job growth between 2000 and 2009. Lateef based his claim about home sale prices on numbers from Real Estate Business Intelligence, which is part of MRIS, a massive realty listing service and database covering the mid-Atlantic. The average price of a Prince William home sale was $414,714 in November 2006, while the median price was $376,000. By February 2011 the average sale price was $260,830 and the median sale price was $228,925. That’s a $153,884 drop in average sale price and a $147,075 drop in median sale prices, straddling the $150,000 decline Lateef mentioned. But Stewart took office in an environment where home prices were already falling in the county. Between November 2005 and November 2006 the average sale price fell 8.1 percent and the median sale price dipped 6 percent, data show. Again, home sales are private transactions. They are not governed or controlled by the board of supervisors. And the county was hardly the only place in America to see a drop in home values. Stewart has noted Prince William’s housing market is closely tied to overall demand and economic activity in the larger D.C. metro area. And the S&P/Case-Shiller Housing Index, a highly-respected source of housing prices, notes the entire Washington, D.C. metro area saw a 24 percent decrease in home prices between November 2006 and January 2011, compared to a 39 percent decrease in Prince William’s median home prices. Let’s review our findings. Lateef’s raw numbers are mostly correct. Unemployment in Prince William is up 159 percent since November 2006, when Stewart took office. But Lateef campaign video omits the facts that the county’s unemployment rate is well below the Virginia rate and even farther below the national rate. Workers in Prince William are much more likely to have a job than the average American. Prince William housing sale prices are down during Stewart’s tenure by roughly $150,000. But prices were already dropping when Stewart took office, and he has little control over home sales. Prices also dropped sharply across the Washington, D.C. area We rate this claim Half True. Lateef’s figures are fine, but he wrongly uses them to imply Stewart is responsible for financial problems that not only shook Prince William County, but the nation.

pomt-07489	Says unions "take away" hard-earned money of teachers, firefighters and police officers to play politics.	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/13/florida-chamber-commerce/chamber-takes-paycheck-protection-proposal-campaig/	The Florida Chamber of Commerce says it is coming to the defense of teachers, police officers and firefighters with a new ad supporting legislation that would prohibit government unions from collecting dues through automated payroll deductions. The problem is, no teachers, police officers or firefighters are publicly saying thanks. Quite the opposite, actually. At a press conference outside the Florida House of Representatives on April 5, 2011, firefighters, cops and teachers accused the business group of misleading people by suggesting these groups supported the proposal, HB 1021. The measure passed the House 73-40 on March 25 and its companion, SB 830, is currently being considered in the Senate. "I find it unconscionable that the people who are attacking the law enforcement officers in this state are now using us to try and further their political agenda," said Mark Hussey, an Orange County deputy sheriff. You can watch the ad that has Hussey and others angry by clicking here, or by pushing play on the video on the right side of this screen. Here's the text: "These public servants dedicate their lives to helping others. Firefighters, police officers, teachers are facing uncertain times. So the last thing they deserve is for unions to take away their hard-earned money to play politics, sometimes without asking for approval. "That's why the U.S. Supreme Court voted to allow workers paycheck protection. After all they do to help us, isn't it time we helped them? Paycheck protection. It's only fair." The ad includes stock images of firefighters, cops and teachers (including video of a teacher also used in an ad in Wisconsin) and suggests that they are struggling to make ends meet. In one scene, a man is hunched over a kitchen table with his head in his hands as a woman and a baby look on. That got us thinking about this phrase that unions "take away" public servants' money to play politics. In a separate item, we checked a response to this ad from the Florida Education Association. First, just a little more about the legislative proposal, since the ad does little to actually explain what it's talking about. Supporters call the idea "paycheck protection," and say House and Senate proposals give individual union members more power over how their dues money is spent. The change in law would do two basic things. First, public unions would be prohibited from utilizing payroll deductions, and second, unions would be required to get annual authorizations from members to use their dues for political reasons. Essentially, workers would be able to be members of the union but opt out of the political arm of the organization. Opponents argue that the House and Senate bills are akin to union busting because they make it more difficult for unions to collect dues. They say the bills also single out unions when more than 360 organizations currently are authorized to deduct money from workers' paychecks by the state. The House sponsor, Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, said that while he's not aware of any unions supporting his bill, individual union members have contacted him and thanked him. (The St. Petersburg Times found no union members supporting the bill through a public records request made to Dorworth's office). The chamber ad, along with glossing over the substance of the proposal, misses a key point that differentiates Florida from other states with government-union political battles brewing -- states like Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania. In those states, workers in certain jobs are required to join the union. In Florida, workers are under no such obligation. That means that no one can be compelled to join a union in Florida, and as such, no one is required to pay union dues. The protections are written into the state Constitution. SECTION 6. Right to work.—The right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or non-membership in any labor union or labor organization. The right of employees, by and through a labor organization, to bargain collectively shall not be denied or abridged. Public employees shall not have the right to strike. Why is that so important? Watch the ad again, or read the script with our description. Through its choice of words and images, the chamber is painting a clear picture. Cops, firefighters and teachers -- struggling to make ends meet -- are having their hard-earned money taken away by unions to play politics. But those cops, firefighters and teachers, at the least, are voluntarily deciding to have that money given to the unions. They are under no requirement to participate in the union, or contribute. Using the chamber's logic, they pay the union dues despite being in potentially bad financial straits. Now the only question is the last bit of the chamber ad specifying how that money is spent. Charles Caulkins, an employer labor lawyer with Fisher and Phillips and a member of the board of directors with the Florida Chamber of Commerce, concedes that union members are not required to join the union, and thus they are not bound to contribute money. But practically speaking, workers often feel either pressure from their colleagues to join the union, or feel like they would get substandard legal representation from the union if needed. And some unions will take a vote of local membership of how to support candidates come election time, he says. But others just take their marching orders from the national unions. "How do they feel about dues being used for a certain political party when they might be in another one?" Caulkins asked rhetorically. "There must be some Republicans and independents who don't like all the money going to Democrats." This comes with caveats, too. Unions don't spend all union dues on political campaigns, said Doug Martin, legislative director of the American Federation of State, Municipal and County Employees in Florida. Unions have separate voluntary political action committees, where members can contribute in addition to their normal union dues. Edie Ousley, a spokeswoman for the chamber, said the ad is factually accurate based on its wording. When PolitiFact Florida began to ask about the combination of the wording and the images, she wrote back: "From a pure PolitiFact perspective, the ad is true." We don't agree. When judging visual advertisements, we consider both the words and the images. In this case, the chamber ad says -- "firefighters, police officers, teachers are facing uncertain times. So the last thing they deserve is for unions to take away their hard-earned money to play politics, sometimes without asking for approval." As those words are said, the chamber shows an image of a man with his head in his hands looking over paperwork as a woman and child stand nearby. The message the ad is sending is clear: Hard-working police officers, firefighters and teachers -- facing uncertain financial times -- are having money taken from them by unions to be used for politics. The fact is union members are voluntarily contributing to unions. If they didn't want to contribute, they wouldn't have to. The chamber has a point that some union dues do go to political activities -- whether that's lobbying legislators in Tallahassee or campaign mailings or working with a campaign -- and individual union members can't always control how their dues money is spend. But that's no different than how most organizations operate. Whether it be the Public Broadcasting System, the United Way, or even the chamber, people donate or contribute money to be pooled with other donations so that the organizations or candidates can spread a message. If the contributor doesn't like that message, they stop giving. Union membership -- and as a result, the contributions that members make -- is voluntary. No group takes money away from union members.

pomt-04709	The GOP platform that seeks further limits on abortion and is silent on an exception for rape "has been there for more than 30 years."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/sep/04/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-gop-platform-has-included-ban-a/	Gov. Bob McDonnell, the leading architect of this year’s Republican national platform, was recently asked to explain why a plank calling for an anti-abortion amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not provide an exception for rape. Controversy over abortion flared in the days leading up to last week’s GOP national convention when Todd Akin, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Missouri, said that "legitimate rape" rarely results in pregnancy because "the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down." Many Republican officials, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have called on Akin to withdraw from the race. Akin has apologized for his comment, but won’t end his campaign. On Aug. 26, former Gov. Charlie Crist, R-Fla., endorsed President Barack Obama in this fall’s election. Crist, in a column in the Tampa Bay Times, wrote that the GOP has included "the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims." That same morning, McDonnell appeared on ABC’s "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" and said there is no Akin amendment. "I tell you, that’s so far afield," he said about Crist’s charge. "He’s wrong on the platform." McDonnell said the GOP’s platform that supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion and is silent on whether there should be exceptions for rape or other circumstances "has been there for more than 30 years." "The details, certainly, are left to Congress, and ultimately, to the states and the people on how they ratify such an amendment and, more importantly, what they do at the state level," the governor said. We wondered if this year’s plank seeking an anti-abortion amendment in the constitution really is no different than those of the last 30 years. There are several mentions of abortion in the 2012 platform. The GOP opposes federal funding for the procedure and seeks a ban on partial-birth abortions. The sweeping platform statement on abortion says, "Faithful to the ‘self-evident’ truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children." This wording has varied only slightly since 1984, when the plank read, "The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children." In 1980, the GOP favored an abortion amendment and was silent on exceptions. The party, however, offered an olive branch to those who disagreed. The plank said, "While we recognize differing views on this question among Americans in general -- and in our own Party -- we affirm our support of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children." Abortion made its platform debut in 1976 at the first GOP national convention to be held after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 establishing abortion rights nationwide. The platform said, "The Republican Party favors a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion and supports the efforts of those who seek enactment of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children." Our ruling McDonnell said the GOP’s platform that supports an anti-abortion amendment to the constitution is silent on whether there should be exceptions for rape or other circumstances "has been there for more than 30 years." The facts back him up. We rate his statement True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-09-04T09:10:51	2012-08-26	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-15012	A state agency wanted to fire an employee who spent four hours per day watching pornography, but the state "employment commission reinstated the person."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/07/scott-walker/wisconsin-couldnt-fire-state-employee-watching-hou/	When Gov. Scott Walker announced his support of a proposed overhaul of Wisconsin’s civil service system, he cited several examples of state worker misdeeds that he said help prove the need for reform. In comments to reporters the next day, Sept. 25, 2015, he repeated one of the examples, saying: "In one of our state agencies, where an employee on average was spending more than four hours a day watching pornographic things on their website. That's something that, even though the agency wanted to terminate that person, the employment commission reinstated the person." The porn-watching employee did get his job back -- but because of the decision of a private arbitrator, not a state commission. Department of Corrections case Here’s how the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in January 2006 about the case of Robert DeLeon, a state probation and parole agent from Shawano: DeLeon was fired in 2004 for accessing Internet pornography and other inappropriate sites for hours a day over a period of at least five months. A computer technician at the Department of Corrections found that DeLeon was logging on to the Internet during the work day for long periods and visiting inappropriate sites, including some with pornography. Computer logs showed DeLeon had spent an average of 4.2 hours a day on the Web in the fall of 2004. During the time he was viewing pornography at work, he had been being paid for more than 10 hours of overtime a week. DeLeon maintained that the logs did not accurately reflect his behavior at work because much of the time he minimized the windows on his computer screen while he worked. DeLeon’s union appealed the termination, which put the case before attorney A. Henry Hempe, a Madison arbitrator. In November 2005, Hempe ruled that instead of being fired, DeLeon should have received a one-day suspension. Part of Hempe’s rationale was that the Department of Corrections had a "relatively light discipline for first-offense misuse of state computers." He cited 10 other recent cases in which corrections employees viewed pornography on state computers, in some cases repeatedly, and none of those employees was fired. Hempe also said DeLeon had a previously unblemished personnel record and had not fallen behind on his work. DeLeon was reinstated to his job and ordered not to use the Internet. The arbitrator also ordered he receive $45,000 in back pay. The state could not appeal the arbitrator’s ruling. Walker has said one reason the civil service system should be overhauled is to enable the state to fire such employees. One change that would be made by the bill, which is expected to pass, would better define the "just cause" definition of fireable offense such as stealing from the state or showing up to work drunk. (The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s state employees database shows DeLeon still works as a probation and parole agent in Shawano, earning nearly $53,000 per year.) We checked with Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission chairman James Scott on this case and for an update on how such cases are handled. Scott told us that at the time of the DeLeon case, collective bargaining agreements controlled how cases such as an appeal of a termination were handled. The cases were heard not by the state commission, but by a private arbitrator who was chosen jointly by the employee’s union and the state department that was involved. The arbitrator's decision on a termination was final, and neither party could take the case to court. Since Act 10, Walker’s 2011 collective bargaining reform law, there are no union contracts in place for state employees that permit arbitration of disputes -- other than for the State Patrol, as public safety employees are excluded from the law. State employees covered by Act 10 who want to challenge a termination or other discipline can file a grievance and can appeal that result to the state commission, Scott said. Our rating Walker said a state agency wanted to fire an employee who spent four hours per day watching pornography, but the state "employment commission reinstated the person." The Department of Corrections in 2005 did terminate a state probation and parole agent who had been watching pornography on his computer for hours a day. The employee was given his job back not by a state commission, but by a private arbitrator, who was chosen jointly by the department and the employee’s union per a collective bargaining contract. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. . More on public employees State Sen. Jon Erpenbach says Scott Walker "said he wouldn't touch" the state civil service system but now supports overhauling it. Mostly False. Mayor Tom Barrett says every general City of Milwaukee employee "pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not." Mostly True. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga says the University of Wisconsin System "is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin." Mostly True.

pomt-06918	Says "in the Legislature, (Mary Nolan) has been a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union."	true	/oregon/statements/2011/jul/22/jack-bogdanski/blogger-says-mary-nolan-party-line-democrat-who-vo/	In early July 2011, Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, announced she’d run for a spot on the Portland City Council. Not long after that, critics started taking aim. Jack Bogdanski, a local blogger, waited just one day, in fact, before he let loose in a blog that questioned Nolan’s (and her husband’s) connections to the council. He also threw in this little bit as an aside: "In the Legislature, she has been a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union." These sorts of attacks are pretty common when it comes to campaigns -- look at how much of a partisan so-and-so is, look how often the candidate votes with a specific organization. Still, they’re worth checking out, not just because it’s important to know whether they’re accurate, but also because it’s important to know what exactly, a "100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union" -- for instance -- might look like. In the statement itself, there are actually two assertions. The first is that Nolan is a party-line Democrat. The second is that she has voted 100 percent in line with the ACLU. Let’s start with the ACLU. This is a pretty easy fact to check. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon creates a Legislative Scorecard for each session dating back to 1997. They don’t have the most recent 2011 session tabulated just yet, so we started with the scorecard that combined the voting positions from the 2009 session and the 2010 special session. On that scorecard, Nolan did get a 100 percent. In fact, Nolan got the highest score of any lawmaker in both the House and Senate. What exactly does that mean? Well, here are some of the votes that earned her that 100: -She opposed a bill that overturned a law prohibiting public school teachers from wearing religious dress. (This passed.)* -She opposed a law that created a government-operated pharmacy database of prescriptions. (This passed.) -She supported a bill that prohibited the state from taking further steps to implement the federal Real ID Act. (This passed.) -She opposed a bill that expanded the death penalty and gave fetuses equal status as a "human being" under state law. (This failed.) -She opposed a bill that would have allowed employers to terminate employees who hold medical marijuana cards, without evidence of impairment on the job. (This failed.) -She opposed an amendment to the Oregon Constitution’s free expression clause to allow local governments to regulate nude dancing. (This failed.) Now, that’s just two sessions worth of voting. We figured we should do our due diligence and check back as far as 2001 -- Nolan’s first term in the Oregon House. As it happens, Nolan has earned a 100 percent each year the scorecard has been done, save for 2003, when she earned an 80 percent. That year she went against the ACLU and voted in favor of legislation that limited access to public records about Oregon Health & Science University animal researchers. Besides that hiccup, though, it does seem that Nolan votes in harmony with the ACLU nearly 100 percent of the time. We asked Nolan whether this sounded right to her and, after taking a look at past scorecards, she said it did. "I don't keep track of scorecards," she said. "But i do very consistently vote to protect the rights of people of color, of women, of kids, of gays and lesbians, of whistle blowers … "It happens that that's what the ACLU cares about. But i care about it because government ought to protect the rights of the people who don't have power of their own." Now, let’s get to that other bit of the statement, the one that calls Nolan a party-line Democrat. To check this bit, we turned to The Oregonian’s Your Government website. People smarter than we are have created a vote recorder that keeps tabs on every floor vote made in the Oregon Capitol and then does some mathematics to figure out just how often a given representative or senator votes with her or his own party. If you look at the numbers for the 2011 session, Nolan voted along party lines just over 92 percent of the time. Your average Democrat last session voted with the party about 94 percent of the time. This database doesn’t got as far back as 2001, but we checked the figures for the 2010 special session and the 2009 regular session. In 2010, she voted with her party 98 percent of the time (same as your average Democrat), and in 2009, she voted with her party 97.5 percent of the time (also the average). Now, these scores don’t offer a whole lot of nuance in terms of what she broke with her party on, but the general idea that she votes in harmony with her party seems pretty well supported by these figures. We’ll give the statement that Nolan is "a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union" a True. *CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the effect of this bill. The sentence has been updated. The ruling was not affected.	None	Jack Bogdanski	None	None	None	2011-07-22T11:56:08	2011-07-06	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'American_Civil_Liberties_Union']
pomt-13465	"The Germans, the French, countries that opposed us in the (Iraq) war, all believed (Saddam Hussein) had weapons of mass destruction."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/paul-wolfowitz/wolfowitz-wrongly-says-germany-france-thought-iraq/	Fifteen years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the debate continues over the events that led to the Iraq War. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press on the anniversary of the attacks, Paul Wolfowitz took questions from host Chuck Todd on the causes and outcomes of the war. Todd asked Wolfowitz, a former deputy secretary of defense, about the war’s stated rationale, which was that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Todd: "Let me ask you this, then, who lied? Is it bad intelligence? You know, somebody got us into this and somebody convinced the United States Congress that weapons of mass destruction were imminent in Iraq, which is why so many Democrats and Republicans voted for this war. So who lied?" Wolfowitz: "I think the original liar is Saddam Hussein, who lied about what he had and we discovered he had more. Later, it seems he was lying that he had more than he really did have because he wanted to supposedly deceive the Iranians. The fact is, every intelligence service in the world, not just the Americans, the British, the Germans, the French, countries that opposed us in the war all believe that he had weapons of mass destruction." The charge that President George W. Bush lied about the Iraq threat has spurred a cottage industry of accusers and defenders. Wolfowitz served under Bush from 2001 to 2005, and remains a Bush defender. Our fact-check asks a different question. We wanted to know if there really was wide consensus that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, especially from France and Germany. (Britain ultimately joined the United States in going to war.) We found much evidence that Germany and France were skeptical. A brief recap While weapons of mass destruction weren’t the only argument for going to war, they were pivotal in the debate. When Vice President Dick Cheney spoke at a veterans convention in August 2002, he described Iraq’s nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities. "There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction," Cheney said. "There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us." President George W. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union Address suggested that Iraq had an active nuclear program. "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." In February 2003 at the United Nations, Secretary of State Colin Powell gave several examples, including biological weapons factories that traveled on rails and wheels. "The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors," he said. "In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War." Powell said the existence of these factories was confirmed by an eyewitness. In our review, we found that the French investigated nuclear matters while the Germans investigated chemical and biological weapons. We’ll look at each in turn. The Germans and a man called 'Curveball' Germany’s political leaders vigorously opposed the war. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined with the French in refusing to sanction the use of force. "We can disarm Iraq without war," he declared in February 2003. Meanwhile, the United States was also absorbing information from the German intelligence service, or BND. When Powell told the United Nations there was eyewitness proof of mobile bio-weapons factories, he was referring to an Iraqi defector who had made it to Germany in 1999. Codenamed "Curveball," Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi had spun a tale for German intelligence in a bid to secure a safe haven for himself. Curveball told the Germans about those mobile labs and said where the Iraqi military might be hiding them. But as we lay out in a bit, by the time Powell relied on that information, the Germans had already warned that the source could not be trusted. Now, to be clear, the record on this point is a bit mixed. The weight of evidence falls on the side that the Germans didn’t believe Iraq had a biological weapons program, but some information suggests they hedged their bets. In making that straddle, their words might have suggested to some American officials that German intelligence thought the threat was real. We’ll walk you through the highlights. A few weeks before the war in February 2003, Germany Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had a tense moment with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at a prominent security conference in Munich. "I am not convinced," Fischer said to Rumsfeld. "That is my problem. I cannot go to the public and say, 'these are the reasons,' because I don't believe in them." Several years later, the Guardian newspaper reported that Fischer said, "Our position was always: (Curveball) might be right, but he might not be right. He could be a liar, but he could be telling the truth." In an investigative report by the Los Angeles Times, two ex-CIA officers said that the German warnings were more forceful than Fischer described. Tyler Drumheller, the former chief of CIA European operations, described a meeting in Washington with his BND counterpart in September 2002. Regarding Curveball, Drumheller said the German agent told him, "We think he's probably a fabricator." That meeting is also part of the 2005 report from the commission that investigated the intelligence failures leading up to the war. Another top American spy manager, James Pavitt, said that information led to screaming matches inside the CIA. "My people were saying, 'We think he's a stinker.' " Now, all of this suggests that German intelligence did not buy Curveball’s testimony and was unsure that Iraq had a biological weapons program. But one letter from the BND to the CIA might have given a different impression. According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, in a December 2002 letter the Germans told the Americans "the information was in essence judged as plausible and convincing, but it couldn't be confirmed." Karl Kaiser, now at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, was director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin during this period. Kaiser told us he was in a pretty good position to know what the Germans thought. "The hype about the alleged presence of WMD in the buildup to the Iraq invasion was not shared at all by the Berlin government," Kaiser said. "The lack of belief in the existence of WMD in Iraq was a major reason why the Schroeder government in my opinion decided not to take part in the invasion." Wolfowitz on the Germans When we asked Wolfowitz about the position of the Germans, he emphasized two points. First, Wolfowitz quoted extensively from the memoir of former CIA Director George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm. The excerpts referenced the letter in which the Germans called the Curveball information "plausible," but they also largely drove home the point that if the Germans had doubts, those concerns didn’t make it up the chain of command. Tenet wrote that he only learned about those questions in 2005, "two years too late to do a damn thing about it." However, even if we take Tenet’s version of events at face value, that doesn’t mean the Germans thought Iraq had biological weapon factories. It just means the upper echelons of the CIA didn’t hear the full story about what the Germans thought. Wolfowitz made a different and stronger point about Iraq’s nuclear capabilities. He cited a March 2002 New Yorker article that included an interview with August Hanning, the BND chief. "It is our estimate that Iraq will have an atomic bomb in three years," Hanning said. But about a year later, Hanning’s views seemed to have shifted. In February 2003, according to an article in Der Spiegel at that time, Hanning and one of his analysts briefed the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament. The analyst told German lawmakers, "Iraq has repeatedly purchased equipment and materials that could be used to produce new weapons of horror." But then Hanning told them he did not believe that there was "any evidence that the Iraqis had resumed their nuclear weapons program." Both reports come from reputable news organizations. The February report came just a few weeks before the war began and suggests that the Germans both publicly and privately did not buy into the American view that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The uncertain French Like the Germans, French leaders opposed entering the war in Iraq. "For us, war is always the proof of failure and the worst of solutions, so everything must be done to avoid it," said Jacques René Chirac, the former president of France in January 2003. And as far as weapons of mass destruction go, the French may have suspected that Iraq had them, but they weren’t certain. A report from the BBC in February 2003 said France, Germany and Russia released a "joint declaration" on the Iraq crisis, which called for more proof of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Chirac attended a joint news conference with Putin and said there was no "undisputed proof" that Iraq had the weapons of mass destruction. "All possibilities of the resolution must be explored and that still leaves a lot of room for manoeuvre to achieve the goal of eliminating any weapons of mass destruction that Iraq may possess," Chirac said. Gérald Arboit, the director of research at the Centre Français de Recherche sur le Renseignement, said the French were uncertain about Curveball, who informed the Germans that Iraq had secret weapons. Arboit also said French intelligence knew that the Niger yellowcake that Bush referred to in the State of the Union address — yellowcake can be used to make weapons-grade uranium — was fake. Arboit said thanks to ties dating back to the colonial period, French intelligence had good sources in Niger. He also said the French nuclear power company Areva was active in the country and was a reliable source of information on uranium supplies. Robert Jervis, an international politics professor at Columbia University, said there were rumors that French intelligence, or the General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), was skeptical of the weapons. However, he added, "As far as I know, neither the British nor the French challenged our intel estimates." Michael O’Hanlon, a national security specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., also said he thought the Germans and French generally accepted the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but he offered no specifics. Our ruling Wolfowitz said the French and Germans believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Publicly, the top elected leaders of both nations said that the evidence was unclear. The Germans, who had talked to an Iraqi defector, were the source of the suspicion that Iraq had developed mobile biological weapon factories. However, months before the war, the Germans had concluded that the defector was unreliable and passed that opinion on to the Americans. They didn’t discount his claim entirely, but they made it clear that it was unverified. The German intelligence agency seemed equally unconvinced that Iraq had resumed its nuclear program. For the French, the American assertion that Iraq sought to buy uranium from Africa rang hollow. The alleged source was Niger, a country where the French had contacts in the mining industry. They found no proof for the claim. Anytime we deal with the activities of intelligence services, there are likely to be gaps in the public record. But from the broad body of evidence, neither the Germans nor the French were persuaded that Saddam Hussein actually had weapons of mass destruction. They might have had suspicions, but they were uncertain and said so publicly and, in all likelihood, privately as well. Wolfowitz went too far when he said that Germany and France believed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. At best they were conflicted. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/12bc9309-1ad5-4a1b-8693-329ac7849335	None	Paul Wolfowitz	None	None	None	2016-09-13T16:00:38	2016-09-11	['Iraq', 'France', 'Saddam_Hussein', 'Germany']
pomt-07707	Says broken compact fluorescent light bulbs "allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks."	false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/05/phyllis-schlafly/phyllis-schlafly-says-broken-cfl-bulbs-allegedly-c/	National conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, mindful of a federal law that stepped up the required efficiency of light bulbs, recently aired her qualms about the compact fluorescent light bulbs offered to consumers as more efficient alternatives to traditional incandescent bulbs. In a column included in a Feb. 2 e-mail blast by the Texas Eagle Forum, the founder of the national Eagle Forum said: "CFL bulbs do not work well in colder temperatures, and most cannot handle dimmer switches; broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks." We’ve previously looked into CFL-related claims, so we know there are variations on this theme. For this article, we’re spotlighting Schlafly’s health claim, that broken CFL bulbs allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks. Seeking illumination, we requested elaboration from the person who sent the e-mail blast, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle Forum. Meantime, we found what looked like Schlafly’s original column, posted online Dec. 21 at WorldNetDaily.com. From the site, we also asked Schlafly for back-up information. Next, we searched online for news stories on CFLs touching off migraines and epileptic episodes. Google led us to an opinion column by Nicolas Loris, a research associate for the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. In the column, posted online Nov. 10 by the Sacramento Bee, Loris writes: "Hospitals and medical charities warn that CFL bulbs cause migraines and epilepsy attacks." Loris told us by e-mail that his source was a November 2009 article published by a British newspaper, The Daily Mail, which quotes "medical charities" saying they have been swamped with complaints that the "flicker of compact fluorescent bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks." The article continues: "The charities are lobbying the (national) government to allow an ‘opt out’ for people with health problems so they can continue to use the older bulbs." Stating that about one in 10 people suffers from migraines, the article quotes Lee Tomkins, of the Migraine Action Association, recommending that residents stockpile conventional bulbs and advising people who suffer from migraines to avoid using fluorescent bulbs as reading lights, or in living areas and kitchens. Phew. Who knew? No one in the United States, it initially appeared. With help from the American Academy of Neurology, we reached a national expert on each affliction. Per migraines, Stephen Silberstein, a professor of neurology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said a light flickering at a certain frequency can aggravate a headache. But, Silberstein said, there is no evidence that CFLs cause migraines. "This is bull," he said. Marc Nuwer, a professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said strobe lights--such as those in discotheques--can flicker at a rate that would touch off a seizure in about 1 in 200 people. However, Nower said, CFL bulbs flicker at much higher rates not detectable by the human eye; they don’t cause epileptic seizures. Nuwer speculated: "Someone is talking about some theoretical far-fetched possibility that a broken light would flash" at the 10 times per second that can cause seizures among a few. "Even then, that’s really different from a strobe light, which is really bright, lighting up a room." Nuwer said his online searches for scientific literature connecting CFLs to epileptic seizures or migraines came up empty. On our behalf, though, he contacted Graham Harding, an international expert on photo-sensitive epilepsy, a form of the disorder in which seizures are triggered by visual stimuli. In e-mails to Nuwer, Harding said that among 174 respondents to an online survey by Epilepsy Action, 4 percent -- seven people -- reported epileptic seizures due to CFL bulbs, and 4 percent due to conventional fluorescent lights, compared to less than 1 percent due to conventional incandescent bulbs. Harding’s e-mail says the 4 percent reporting problems with CFLs referred to the lights flashing on start-up or because the bulbs were faulty. Harding’s e-mail closes: "So the risk (of induced seizures) is no greater than with normal fluorescent but is more than ordinary filament light bulbs." All that said, he continued, since conventional bulbs have been phased out, with fluorescents presumably replacing many of them, the United Kingdom’s Epilepsy Action group has not reported any seizure problems to him. Nuwer also passed along a comment from Robert Fisher, a Stanford University neurologist and director of the Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Fisher said by e-mail that fluorescent lights in the United States and Europe flicker at a higher frequency "than would be likely to provoke photosensitive seizures." But a "defective light may flicker at a lower frequency" and such flickering "can and has caused seizures in a few susceptible individuals... So it could happen, but it would be expected to be a rare occurrence." Next, we interviewed Mark Rea, director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lighting Research Center, who said he’s seen no U.S. study demonstrating headaches or epileptic attacks occur because of CFLs. He noted, though, that a 1989 study completed in Great Britain compared the incidence of headaches in an office under different kinds of fluorescent lighting. According to that study, the incidence of eye strain and headaches were cut in half when high-frequency lights were used. Finally, we came across a paper on CFLs’ impact on health adopted by the European Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks in September 2008. The paper says: "There is no scientific evidence that fluorescent lamps including CFL(s) induce (epileptic) seizures." While flickering light in general can induce migraines, the paper says, scientific "support for aggravating symptoms by flicker from fluorescent tubes was not found." Similarly, while there’s "evidence showing that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy," the paper says, " there are no reported effects of CFL having such effects." Meanwhile, the Texas Eagle Forum’s Carlson relayed a defense of Schlafly’s statement from Schlafly’s son, John. Schlafly pointed out that his mother’s use of the word "allegedly" signaled that she was "not claiming she had scientific proof CFLs cause migraines or epilepsy. However, it is a fact that some people who suffer from migraines or epilepsy believe that CFLs cause or aggravate those painful and debilitating conditions, he said. Our take: Flickering lights of various origins have been linked to migraines and epileptic seizures. But there appears to be no scientific evidence that CFLs, broken or otherwise, cause either disorder. We rate Schlafly’s statement False.

pomt-11081	"There’s actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/jun/18/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-child-parent-separations-border-tied/	Ted Cruz said a court order prevents children from staying with immigrating parents who are jailed at the U.S.-Mexico border. A reader asked us if that’s so. Cruz, the Texas Republican seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018, said in an interview aired June 11, 2018, that when Barack Obama was president, families entering the country were able to stay together because adults were released rather than detained. For longer than that, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted, and many parents and children were placed in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Of late, though, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission. In April 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would go to detention centers, leaving their newly unaccompanied children to be managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. On "Think," a public-affairs program produced at Dallas-based KERA radio, Cruz said: "You know, you think about it, when someone gets arrested for a crime -- let’s say an American citizen gets arrested for a crime, for murder, for burglary, for whatever — if you’re arrested for a crime, you’re separated from your children, you’re put in prison. If you’re the only caregiver for that child, then you’ve got to find alternative care for those children. That is often another family member or, if need be, it’s a foster family or some other means to care for kids. That is the inevitable consequence of somebody being arrested for a crime. "This is an issue that, I think, the media has largely constructed because what’s shifted is that the (President Donald) Trump administration is endeavoring if people cross illegally to arrest them, not to let them go--and so if they have kids, you know, there is actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail." A 1997 agreement We sought detail about the described order; Maria Jeffrey in Cruz’s Senate office told us by email that Cruz was referring to a 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. We didn’t spot language in the January 1997 agreement in Flores v. Reno that explicitly bars children from staying with parents who have been detained or jailed. (See our summary of the agreement here.) There’s no such provision in the agreement, immigration lawyers told us. "Absolutely not," Denise Gilman, who heads an immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said by email, a conclusion also aired by Peter Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights, which was involved in the litigation that led to the agreement. Muzaffar Chishti, a New York lawyer for the Migration Policy Institute, called Cruz’s claim an "inverse interpretation" of the Flores agreement. "He’s basically saying a court order that mandates protecting children is the one that says you must separate families," Chishti said by phone. Put another way, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law said by email that the Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but Su said it doesn’t condone or require the separation of children from parents. ‘Least restrictive setting’ We read the agreement, which says it sets out national policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the government agency overseeing immigration matters before Congress after 9/11 reorganized and renamed departments under the new Department of Homeland Security. "The INS," the agreement states, "shall place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs" provided the minor is poised to make timely appearances before immigration authorities and her or his well-being is protected. We noticed, too, that the agreement stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family. For instance, it says INS facilities will provide "contact with family members who were arrested with the minor" and segregate unaccompanied minors from unrelated adults. Also, the agreement says, where the INS finds the detention of a minor isn’t required to secure his or her timely appearance, it shall release the minor "without unnecessary delay." The minor, the agreement says, should be released, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, an adult relative or an adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian or parent. Subsequent choices, the agreement says, extend to licensed programs or, ultimately, another adult or entity seeking custody as an alternative to long-term custody and when "family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility." Instructions to INS "service officers" in the agreement include a section titled "family reunification," which says: "Upon taking a minor into custody, the INS, or the licensed program in which the minor is placed, will promptly attempt to reunite the minor with his or her family to permit the release of the minor" in accord with the agreement’s order-of-preference list. "Such efforts at family reunification," the instructions say, "will continue so long as the minor is in INS or licensed program custody." Additional interpretation We asked Cruz’s aide to point out the part of the agreement requiring the separation of children from parents. By email, Jeffrey noted the mandate that minors be placed in the "least restrictive" setting and the section about minors being released to family members if possible. Jeffrey further pointed out that the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. In that dispute, over the Obama administration placing children with their parents in family detention centers, the appeals court upheld a lower court’s refusal to amend the Flores agreement to accommodate family detention--after which, Su told us, the Obama administration chose to simply release such parents and children. Jeffrey wrote that Cruz’s "point is simple and 100% correct: When the parents are detained, the Flores agreement compels placing the child with another family member or in another less restrictive setting." Su alerted us to another arguably influential factor; a 2008 law requires immigration officials holding a minor to transfer the minor to the care of HHS within 72 hours "after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child," the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 states. Government has options Gilman said Cruz’s claim misleads in part by suggesting parents are getting shuttled into criminal jails and then children, newly unaccompanied, quickly must be handed off to the refugee resettlement office. What actually happens, Gilman wrote, is that parents and children are detained in a border facility and children are taken from parents while the family is at the facility, before criminal charges are brought. Next, Gilman wrote, children are taken into custody and away from the facility by refugee resettlement staff. Only then, Gilman said, are the parents criminally prosecuted before being given a sentence of time served, "which really is just the time spent at the border facility," Gilman said. Next, Gilman said, parents are returned to the border facility "but the child is already gone." At that point, the parents are typically sent to an adult immigration detention facility to spend several months--even if they’re successful in passing an asylum screening interview and getting released on bond, Gilman wrote. Su called Cruz’s claim technically correct but misleading in that it leaves the inaccurate impression that the government, by policy and law, has no choice but to separate children from parents. "The Trump administration’s hands were not forced," Su wrote. "There are multiple ways that separation could be avoided and the nation's interest in immigration adjudication and removal could still be maintained. But the ‘zero tolerance’ policy of detaining and criminally prosecuting all immigrants, even those who arrived with children, is what has led to this." Summing up, Su said the 2008 law, Flores agreement and court rulings effectively bar the government from sending a detained parent and child to an adult prison together. By policy, Su said, the Trump administration made clear it wasn’t in favor of releasing parents and children--which left it with the options of sending parents to prison and releasing children or sending parents to prison and sending children to child detention facilities overseen by the government. Su said Cruz’s claim, intimating the government has had no choice but to separate children from parents, also overlooks the government’s power to release children to other family members or guardians or even to expand family detention centers so long as they fulfill the agreement’s "least restrictive setting" requirement. "So yes," Su said, "Cruz is right that once you have make the decision to send the parents to jail, separation may be necessary because Flores generally forbids the government from detaining children in jail," Su wrote. "Although given the horrors of separation, and the rumors of children not being reunited with their parents even after removal," Su said, "it may be that keeping parents and children together in jail would be the ‘least restrictive setting’ if the other option is separation. It is important to note that, from my reading, neither the Flores settlement nor the litigants and judge involved foresaw that the settlement would lead to separation of parents of children," Su said. Our ruling Cruz said a court order "prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail." There’s an element of truth to Cruz’s interpretation of the 1997 Flores agreement requiring children to be released or placed in least restrictive settings. As he said, children can’t be jailed with their parents. But that’s true in any situation in which a parent is sent to jail. However, the agreement doesn't mandate the separations occurring on the border, which have stepped up due to a Trump administration change in enforcement policy. If anything, the agreement focuses on ways to protect immigrant children and to reunite them with their families. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07939	Says he "helped lead an outside audit that’ll save (Milwaukee County) taxpayers over $200 million."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/27/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/	What is it about candidates for Milwaukee County executive claiming they’re saving taxpayers millions upon millions of dollars? Lee Holloway, the County Board chairman, said on Jan. 12, 2011 he had saved the county more than $100 million in health care costs. Now comes philanthropist and political newcomer Chris Abele. He makes his own brag in the first TV ad of the ad of the campaign, unveiled Jan. 25, 2011. In the ad, as the words "Save Over $200 million" appear on the screen, a narrator says Abele "helped lead an outside audit that’ll save taxpayers over $200 million." We rated Holloway’s statement Mostly True. Let’s take a look at Abele’s. The "audit" the ad refers to is a report commissioned in 2006 by the Greater Milwaukee Committee’s Task Force on Milwaukee County's Fiscal Crisis. Abele and businessman Sheldon Lubar co-chaired the task force. (Lubar is also co-chairman of Abele’s campaign.) Milwaukee County was in a fiscal crisis largely because of its pension scandal. To shore up the pension fund, the report recommended that the state Legislature allow the county to issue pension obligation bonds. The county would then borrow money to pay off the unfunded portion of its pension liability. The idea wasn’t new; as county executive, Scott Walker proposed the bonds in 2004. But the idea didn’t take hold until Walker proposed it again in January 2008. A month later, Abele and Lubar cited their 2006 recommendation and pushed the bonds by co-authoring an article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So, the idea Abele credits to the "audit" originated with Walker and -- once revived by the task force -- was proposed again by Walker. The Legislature ultimately approved the enabling legislation, which was backed by Holloway and introduced by another county executive candidate, state Rep. Jeff Stone, R-Greendale. Yes, you may need a scorecard for this one. In March 2009, the county issued $400 million in pension obligation bonds. Now let’s examine the second part of Abele’s statement -- that the pension obligation bonds will save the county over $200 million. It is presented as if there is no uncertainty about this number, as a settled fact. The bonds are a debt the county must repay. If by investing the borrowed money the county can reach its goal of an 8 percent return, it could save an estimated $237 million in pension contributions over 25 years. But if the investments don’t earn at least 6.19 percent, the county could wind up paying extra. In the first year, $8.5 million was saved. So, they are off to a good start. But it will be many years before we know whether the approach saved the county any money over the period at all. Even before the ad, Abele focused on the issue. In a Jan. 19, 2011 letter soliciting campaign donations, which aides say was sent to a few thousand people, Abele declared: "As a concerned private citizen, I led an audit of the county's pension problems and identified a solution that saved Milwaukee County taxpayers $237 million." The claim that $237 million has already been saved is clearly wrong. Campaign spokesman Brandon Lorenz told PolitiFact Wisconsin the wording in the letter "was not up to our standards" and is no longer being used. So, let’s get back to what is being used. Abele said an idea he helped propose -- pension obligation bonds -- will save the county over $200 million. He had a role in pushing for the plan, but it had already been on the table and Walker re-introduced it. As for the money-savings statement, the savings is presented as a settled fact, but it’s far from it. There’s no guarantee the bonds will save the county any money over the repayment period. We won’t know for another 23 years. We rate Abele’s statement False.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2011-01-27T09:00:00	2011-01-25	['Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin']
pomt-09639	Health care reform plans being consided in Congress "will finally reduce the costs of health care."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/18/barack-obama/obama-said-health-care-reform-will-reduce-cost-hea/	After meeting with Senate Democrats on Dec. 15, President Barack Obama made a number of claims about what the health care bill would achieve if passed. "We agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care," Obama said. "Families will save on their premiums; businesses that will see their costs rise if we do nothing will save money now and in the future. This plan will strengthen Medicare and extend the life of that program. And because it gets rid of the waste and inefficiencies in our health care system, this will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade. "Now, I just want to repeat this because there's so much misinformation about the cost issue here. You talk to every health care economist out there and they will tell you that whatever ideas are -- whatever ideas exist in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs for families, businesses, and government, those elements are in this bill." Obama's comments came on the heels of a report from Richard S. Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) -- a nonpolitical civil service employee -- that concluded various provisions of the Senate bill "would have a significant downward impact on future health care cost growth rates." However, Foster continued, those effects would be outweighed by the increased cost associated with expanding health insurance coverage to another 33 million Americans. Specifically, the report estimates that the total national health expenditures under the Senate bill would increase by an total of $234 billion (0.7 percent) between 2010 and 2019. Curiously, both Republicans and Democrats hailed the report as a victory for their side. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the report "shows that health reform will ensure both the federal government and the American people spend less on health care than if this bill doesn't pass, helping get a hold of America's debt and keep more money in people's pockets. This report is yet another clear indicator that we have to act - and act now." Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley said the Foster report showed that the Senate bill "doesn't do anything to reduce the unsustainable growth in health care spending and in fact would make health care costs grow more rapidly." Confused yet? We decided to wade in and sort some of this out. First, we need to acknowledge that when it comes to characterizing the "costs of health care," there are several ways to look at it. The first is how much people would pay in health insurance premiums. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) studied the health care bill proposed by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and concluded that if passed, most people would see a very modest decrease in premiums by 2016 (compared to what they would pay under the current system). How modest? Best-case scenario - for those in group plans with large companies - about 3 percent better. For a small percentage of people (less than 8 percent of the insured) who would buy insurance on the individual market, and who wouldn't be eligible for federal subsidies, they might actually pay 10 to 13 percent more, though with new federal minimum standards, they'd also be getting more insurance coverage as well. The second way to look at cost is its effect on the national deficit. And here again, the CBO has weighed in on the Reid plan. The CBO concluded that while the plan would be very expensive, the bill is also more than paid for with new taxes and plans to reduce health care spending over time. The net effect, according to the CBO, is that over 10 years, the plan would end up reducing the national deficit by $130 billion. Which brings us to a third way to look at cost, whether the plan would lower the rate of health care inflation over the long term. Republicans are correct when they say that based on the CMS report, health care spending would increase by $234 billion over the next 10 years. But remember, that's with a plan that is estimated to cover an additional 33 million people. So spending would increase 0.7 percent while adding coverage to roughly 10 percent of the population. In his report, Foster said numerous studies have demonstrated that people with health insurance use more health services than people without insurance. So we'll be spending more over the next 10 years, even more than if we didn't pass the bill, according to the CMS report. But let's talk a minute about the "rate of growth" of health care spending. That's what Obama is talking about when he says he wants to "bend the cost curve." According to the projections in the CMS report, the rate of growth in national health care expenditures will spike a bit in the middle years of the health reform plan. That's when the provisions that result in 33 million more people getting health insurance will kick in. But in the later years of the 10-year projections, the rate of growth rises slower than under current law (albeit only slightly: in 2019, for example, it's the difference between rising at a clip of 6.9 percent under the proposed plan as opposed to 7.2 percent under current law). So when Obama says reforms will lower the cost of health care, what he means is that they will eventually slow the rate of growth of health care expenses. This can be pretty confusing stuff. And we think both sides in the debate are guilty of oversimplifying to score political points. It's also worth noting that while the CMS is a legitimate nonpartisan source, there's lots of difference of opinion among respected economists about how various cost-cutting proposals in the plan will shake out. In other words, these projections are all highly speculative. "There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty about whether what's in the bill will be enough to lower health care inflation," said Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility. "No one knows for sure." All of the cost estimates being proffered are "extraordinarily treacherous," because many of the changes being considered are unprecedented in history at this scale, said Henry Aaron, health policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. Still, he said, the bill contains many of the devices that economists say could help to slow the growth of health care spending over time. So when Obama says the plan would cut the cost of health care, it's not a simple answer. If he's talking about cutting people's premiums, the president is backed up by the CBO. According to the CBO, some people would pay more, but on average, most people -- people in employer plans -- would see very modest reductions in premiums compared to what they'd be expected to pay if nothing changes. If he's talking about the deficit, again, he's got support. The CBO estimates the plan would slightly reduce the deficit. But when it comes to cutting health care expenditures, it's a little trickier. According to CMS, spending is expected to rise slightly (0.7 percent), due to adding some 33 million more people to the insured ranks. Obama can make a case that in the later years of the 10-year projection, the rate of growth for health care expenditures would be somewhat slowed. But in attempting to simpify the issue, saying that the plan would reduce the cost of health care, we think Obama sacrifices some accuracy. And so we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-02653	"Seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/15/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-70-worlds-poor-are-women/	Editors note: After this fact-check published, we looked deeper into the stat Fiorina cited. You can read that work here. It is a powerful statistic that speaks to a fundamental injustice in this world. It emerged nearly two decades ago and has been used as a call to action ever since. Over the weekend, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina repeated it on ABC’s This Week. "Seventy percent of the people living in abject poverty are women," Fiorina said. But so far as anyone can tell, that statement has no basis in fact. We reached out to Fiorina’s office and asked for the supporting data. We did not hear back. We went to the World Bank data pages and contacted the bank’s research staff. We exchanged emails with the United Nations Development Programme, and UN Women, an entity focused on gender equality. None of them could point to statistics that would confirm this claim. "I checked with our research colleagues, and we can indeed not verify this figure either," said Nanette Braun, chief of communications and advocacy at UN Women headquarters. It’s a telling admission, given that UN Women references the statistic on its own Web page. Duncan Green, who spent eight years as director of research for Oxfam-Great Britain, the international poverty relief organization, flagged a problem with the statistic three years ago in a blog post on Oxfam’s website. Green is now Oxfam’s special strategic adviser. "Every expert (feminist economists, poverty researchers etc.) I’ve consulted on this agrees the number is dodgy," Green wrote. "Yet people just keep on using it, presumably because its message is one they want to promote." The original statistic dates to at least 1995, when it was mentioned in the United Nations Human Development Report. The report warned about rising disparities. "The most persistent of these has been gender disparity, despite a relentless struggle to equalize opportunities between women and men. The unfinished agenda for change is still considerable. Women still constitute 70 percent of the world's poor and two thirds of the world's illiterates." The 70 percent figure shows up a couple of times in the 205-page report but not in any of the report’s statistical tables. In fact, staff at the United Nations Development Programme said they no longer use it. Experts told us they’re not sure what the real figure is, but that it’s likely lower than 70 percent. "Its not easy to say how many women are poor because data on poverty are typically constructed on a household basis," said Diane Elson, professor of sociology at the University of Essex. In other words, surveys don’t count how many women and men live in each household. Statisticians, some within the United Nations itself, began debunking the 70 percent figure as early as 1998 -- just three years after it gained prominence. Sylvia Chant, professor of development geography at the London School of Economics, pointed us to 2002 data from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. In Latin American countries, by a slight margin, women were more likely to live in poverty in rural areas. But the reverse was sometimes true in cities. "In 10 out of 17 countries, the proportion of men in poverty is actually on a par with or slightly higher than women," Chant wrote in 2008. "Women are nowhere near the level of 70 percent of people in income poverty as popularly expounded." A 2001 analysis of 10 developing countries largely found no statistically significant differences. Where there was a gap, in every country but one, it was very narrow, and sometimes, as in the Latin America survey, men outnumbered women in poverty. Chant said Fiorina’s claim is no more right today than when it first emerged. Green, the Oxfam adviser, agreed. "It was wrong then, and remains wrong," Green said. One note: While we don’t have a worldwide figure, we can use Census Bureau data to come up one for the United States. According to the most recent data, females account for 55 percent of Americans living in poverty. Our ruling Fiorina said that women account for 70 percent of the people in the world who live in poverty. She provided no support for the claim, nor does any seem to exist. We contacted the international bodies that rely on such statistics, and they told us they do not have the data to back up the claim. Independent experts echoed that point. At least in Latin America and the United States, the data suggest a much lower figure. We rate this claim False.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2014-01-15T11:02:54	2014-01-12	['None']
pomt-14989	"60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/14/gwen-moore/six-10-americans-back-federal-money-planned-parent/	When U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said, "I don’t think we do children a favor by forcing women to give birth," she drew criticism from The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning website. The Milwaukee Democrat was speaking at a Washington, D.C., news conference in favor of continuing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Moore made similar remarks the next day, Sept. 29, 2015, during a speech on the House floor about a Republican-backed bill to defund the organization. And she made a claim we thought we’d check. "The reality is," Moore said, "is that 60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded." Given the recent publicity over secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials, we wondered where support stands for federal funding of the group. Defunding Planned Parenthood The series of videos, first released in July 2015, were recorded by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress. They show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The center alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The videos led to the defunding effort. Earlier this month, we checked a claim by Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Speaking on the House floor in favor of the defunding bill, Duffy said millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives. We rated his claim Mostly True. The organization itself has not made the expenditures, but Planned Parenthood affiliates have. Polls on defunding To check Moore's claim, we examined results of national polls conducted in September 2015, earlier in the same month in which she made the claim. Three surveys back Moore: A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of adults asked: "Would you favor or oppose totally eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning and preventative health services?" The result: 61 percent opposed. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of likely voters asked: "Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off: yes or no?" The result: 65 percent said no. A Pew Research Center poll used a more complex question -- tying funding to a possible government shutdown-- but got a similar result: 60 percent of adults said any federal budget agreement to avert a government shutdown would have to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood. In two other surveys, a majority supported continued federal funding of Planned Parenthood, though the levels were less than 60 percent: Quinnipiac University asked registered voters: "Do you support or oppose cutting off federal government funding to Planned Parenthood?" The result: 52 percent opposed. The New York Times/CBS poll asked adults: "Do you think Planned Parenthood should or should not receive funding from the federal government?" The result: 55 percent said should. We consulted three polling experts, including Charles Franklin, the Marquette Law School Poll director and co-founder of Pollster.com. He noted that, on average, support for funding was 58.6 percent in the five polls. Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow and research coordinator at the American Enterprise Institute, said critics argue the polls didn't ask respondents if they preferred the federal funding go to other organizations rather than to Planned Parenthood. She said although it isn't clear how much attention Americans are paying to the videos controversy, the available polling data suggests most support continued funding. Our rating Moore said: "60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded." Three national polls put the support at 60 percent or higher. Two others show support of less than 60 percent, but taken together, the average support among the five polls is nearly 59 percent. We rate Moore's statement True.

pomt-04823	"NASCAR fans are twice as likely as non fans to serve in the military and 37 percent of active servicemembers and veterans are NASCAR fans."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/17/steve-phelps/nascar-executive-says-many-fans-serve-military/	When the Army dropped its sponsorship of a NASCAR racing team, the good ol’ boy institution responded with wonkish restraint. A statement from Stewart-Haas Racing said the change was due to the Army’s "reallocation of its marketing budget." NASCAR’s statement was written in business speak and included a statistic: "NASCAR fans are twice as likely as non fans to serve in the military and 37 percent of active servicemembers and veterans are NASCAR fans," NASCAR Chief Marketing Officer Steve Phelps said in a July 10 article in The Hill, which covers Congress. The National Guard still sponsors a team. This is just the kind of data NASCAR might publicize to coax it to stay. Is it correct? The threat of losing the Guard is real. U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., regularly introduces attempts to stop all military sports sponsorships, not just NASCAR. This year, she gained the support of Republican U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah, a budget hawk. They failed, but with federal budget cuts on the horizon, sponsorships remain at risk. We reached out to NASCAR, academics, private research companies, McCollum and Kingston. Kingston’s office did not respond. An official from McCollum’s office criticized Phelps’ claim but gave no specific data. NASCAR sent us proprietary information from Experian Consumer Research, a private data company. The findings came from a survey of about 25,000 U.S. adults, including nonfans. Experian found that 18 percent of NASCAR fans serve or have served in the armed forces or reserves, compared with 9 percent of nonfans. In other words, fans were twice as likely to serve or be veterans. This is close to what Phelps said. He said fans were twice as likely "to serve" in the military. Experian also reported that about 37 percent of current or past military members were fans, just as Phelps said. There are shortcomings in Experian’s data. The definition of "fan" was broad. It includes respondents who said they were "very," "somewhat" or "a little bit" interested in NASCAR. Also, the findings are not the result of a peer-reviewed study published in an academic journal -- the gold standard of research. NASCAR paid for the data. These factors do not discredit the poll, but we’d have more confidence in its findings if other surveys had similar results. Confirmation was hard to find. "In general, there is a bizarrely scant amount of NASCAR research among sport fandom scholars," said John Spinda, an assistant professor at Murray State University in Kentucky. He has published research on NASCAR. Still, Spinda and others agreed that NASCAR’s military data made sense in light of other research. "NASCAR fans are more likely to be male and less likely to be college-educated, so it makes sense that fans would be more likely to be involved in the military," said Larry DeGaris, director of the Academic Sports Marketing Program at the University of Indianapolis. DeGaris is also president of the company Sponsorship Research & Strategy, which researches corporate sponsorship. A 2006 poll of more than 1,000 respondents found that 56 percent of those who described themselves as fans were male. The private firm Scarborough Research asked 200,000 people whether they had "any interest in NASCAR" in its survey from August 2010 through September 2011. Fans were 31 percent more likely to be male than U.S. adults in general, and 13 percent were less likely to have graduated from college. James Dertouzos has studied military sponsorships as senior economist at the nonprofit RAND Corp. He said NASCAR’s audience is also more likely to be blue-collar, middle-class, Southern or Midwestern, and politically conservative "These are exactly the people who have positive impressions of service in the military," Dertouzos said. RAND is an independent research institute with roots in the U.S. military and defense industries. Data support his statement. Scarborough reported fans were 19 percent more likely to be blue-collar workers. That company’s 2009 data, posted on NASCAR’s website, also agree with Dertouzos’ assessment that fans are more likely to be Midwestern and Southern, although Sponsorship Research & Strategy found they were more evenly distributed. DeGaris’ group found fans were more likely to be Republican. It’s worth noting that Scarborough found that fans were 18 percent more likely to have "military specific" jobs. This appears to support Phelps’ claim, but researchers surveyed few people in this category. These findings are not as reliable as their other data, a spokeswoman told us. Our conclusion: What little data that exists appears to support Phelps’ points that NASCAR fans are more likely to serve, and that service members and veterans are more likely to be fans. Phelps appears to give a correct impression, although supporting data are thin. We give him a Mostly True.	None	Steve Phelps	None	None	None	2012-08-17T06:00:00	2012-07-10	['NASCAR']
pomt-10799	"Look, I believe in accountability. In 1983, I led the effort in Arkansas to improve our schools."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/07/hillary-clinton/no-records-but-there-are-witnesses/	In responding to a question about testing from education, Sen. Hillary Clinton said she "led the effort" to improve Arkansas schools in 1983. It might seem an easy fact to prove. But 24-year-old records from Arkansas don't pop up on the Internet, and folks from the state's Department of Education apologized that someone apparently had thrown out the supporting documents. So we turned to press clippings from the time, and to the folks who were there. They unequivocally state that Clinton, who was Arkansas First Lady at the time, did chair the state's 1983 Education Standards Committee at a time when Arkansas was trying to move up from the bottom of the nation's many school-related rankings, from student performance to teacher pay. After meetings in all 75 counties, the committee made several recommendations. These included raising the dropout age, requiring all high schools to offer advanced math and science courses, and mandating smaller class sizes. To pay for the changes, it also proposed a sales tax increase. And to win support for these ideas, Clinton and her husband, then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, called for competency tests for all teachers — something the teachers hated but the public loved. "Over and over again I was asked, 'What are you going to do about all the incompetent teachers?'" Mrs. Clinton told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1984. The initiatives won resounding approval in a special session of the Legislature in late 1983. But was Mrs. Clinton a chairwoman in name only? Or was she truly the change agent? "She shepherded it through and was absolutely instrumental in getting it approved through the legislative process and accepted in general by the public," said Peggy Nabors, president of the state teachers union at the time, who now is leaning toward supporting Clinton for president. The state has made many education reforms since, and its national ranking has risen to the middle of the pack. Arkansas School Boards Association executive director Dan Farley, a Clinton backer, said the 1983 initiative lit the flame for such changes in a state that didn't have education on its front burner before. "We still have a way to go," he said. "But the earliest flickering started then."	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-10-07T00:00:00	2007-09-13	['Arkansas']
pomt-07816	Says there are Ohio Turnpike workers getting paid $66,000 a year to collect tolls that machines might collect.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/17/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-some-toll-workers-make-66000-/	Gov. John Kasich took office putting unionized state and local government employees on notice that he is out to end collective bargaining and weaken organized labor groups. Earlier this month, he again signaled that Ohio Turnpike toll collectors are on his hit list but this time offered up a reason why they, too, should be targeted. In an interview with The Washington Post the governor recounted the challenges that lie ahead as he and state lawmakers began negotiating the next biennial operating budget with an $8 billion deficit looming. Columnist George F. Will, noting that the governor is considering privatizing prisons or leasing the Ohio Turnpike, paraphrases Kasich as saying there are people getting paid $66,000 a year to collect tolls that machines might collect. While we didn’t hear Kasich’s interview with Will, Kasich has made similar remarks before. His staff confirmed for us that Will recounted his remark correctly and also cited a report on 2009 data from the Buckeye Institute. But Teamsters Union Local 436, which represents toll collectors, just announced in January that it had agreed to a new three-year deal with the Ohio Turnpike Commission which freezes their hourly pay at $19.50 to start and tops out at $24.41 after five years. Even at the top pay scale, a toll collector who works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would earn just under $51,000. In light of that, Politifact Ohio thought it’d check out the governor’s claim. As it turns out, many toll collectors make big money from overtime work. Some tack on upwards of 30 percent of the base salary in overtime pay, according to the Ohio Turnpike Commission's 2010 ending year salaries. Indeed, in 2010, five toll collectors made more than $66,000 a year. The highest earner collected $80,719.99, which included $29,964.23 in overtime pay. Of the five, three worked at the Lordstown East location at exit 216 along the toll road. The other two worked at the Eastgate location at exit 238 near the Pennsylvania border. To be fair, the median pay for the collectors was about $52,000. And only 13 of the 286 full-time collectors earned over $60,000 in base and overtime pay in 2010. Also, in addition to the new contract with a pay freeze, about 90 of the 643 full- and part-time collectors took a buyout as the turnpike commission began trimming its salary budget now that it has the E-Z Pass system. Still, Kasich is looking for more relief salary relief, especially now that the E-Z Pass system is in place. Also, lowering the turnpike commission's spending could make leasing it a more attractive deal. Kasich has said that he wants at least $3 billion for the turnpike, though he has not said how many years his ideal turnpike lease would cover. PolitiFact Ohio sought comment from Teamsters Union Local 436 President Gary M. Tiboni and the union’s direct representative for the Turnpike, Alisha Urbina, but neither returned our calls. So where does that leave us on the Truth-O-Meter? Kasich is correct that some toll collectors make as much as $66,000 a year. But only five who made that much in 2010 and only 13 of the state’s 286 full-time collectors (about 4.5 percent) earned over $60,000 that same year. That’s additional information that provides clarification. We rate Kasich comments Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-02-17T06:00:00	2011-02-06	['Ohio']
pomt-08663	Says John Boehner changed his position on extending Bush tax cuts.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/13/robert-gibbs/robert-gibbs-right-call-john-boehners-stance-tax-e/	House Republican Leader John Boehner, made headlines on the Sept. 12, 2010, edition of CBS' Face the Nation with his comments about a limited extension of George W. Bush-era tax cuts. During the show, host Bob Schieffer asked the Ohio Republican to elaborate on his approach to extending a series of tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year. President Barack Obama and key Democratic leaders are seeking to renew the tax cuts for Americans earning below $200,000 (for single earners) and below $250,000 (for married couples). By contrast, Republican leaders, including Boehner, have consistently called for renewing the tax cuts for all taxpayers, regardless of income. (Some Democrats have said they would side with the Republicans, at least for the next year or two.) Schieffer pressed him on whether he would be willing to vote for the more limited Democratic approach. "If the only option I have is to vote for some of those tax reductions ... I’ll vote for them," Boehner responded. "But I’ve been making the point now for months that we need to extend all the current rates for all Americans if we want to get our economy going again and we want to get jobs in America." Schieffer then made several attempts to confirm that Boehner really meant that he could support the Democratic version if it came to that. Boehner said that he could. "Bob, we don’t know what the bill is going to say, all right?" Boehner said. "If the only option I have is to vote for those at ($250,000) and below, of course, I’m going to do that. But I’m going to do everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans." The White House pounced on Boehner's comment and suggested he had flip-flopped. In a one-sentence statement issued later that afternoon, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, "We welcome John Boehner's change in position and support for the middle class tax cuts, but time will tell if his actions will be anything but continued support for the failed policies that got us into this mess." We thought it would be worth checking whether Boehner's statement represented a "change in position." Boehner's staff doesn't dispute that prior to the Face the Nation appearance, Boehner hadn't gone so far as to say he'd support a Democratic bill that would not extend the cuts for the wealthiest Americans. So there is some truth to the White House's characterization of the statement as a "change in position." Previously, he hadn't mentioned that possibility; suddenly, he did. On some level, that is a "change of position." But it leaves out a lot of context we think is important. In the interview, it actually took four questions by Schieffer to elicit a conciliatory answer from Boehner toward the Democratic proposal. In his answers to those first three questions, Boehner made clear that he favored extending the tax cuts for all brackets. Boehner said in response to Schieffer's first question, "I think raising taxes in ... a very weak economy is a really, really bad idea. And most economists would agree with that. And I just think that if we’re going to extend the tax cuts for some Americans, why don’t we extend ... the current tax rates to all Americans, ... and get rid of some of the uncertainty that is out there, so that small businesses can plan and reinvest in ... their business and the new economy." And in the same response that made so much news, Boehner reiterated, "I’ve been making the point now for months that we need to extend all the current rates for all Americans." Indeed, Boehner has been consistent about that. In a high-profile economic address before the City Club of Cleveland on Aug. 24, 2010, Boehner said, "President Obama should work with Republicans to stop all of these job-killing tax hikes." And in a Sep. 8, 2010, press release in response to an economic speech by the president, Boehner advocated a "two-point plan for immediate, bipartisan action on jobs and spending," with one of the two points being "a two-year freeze on all current tax rates." We'll add that the second part of Gibbs' statement -- that "we welcome John Boehner's change in position and support for the middle class tax cuts" -- also raised a question in our mind. If Gibbs is merely thanking Boehner for his longtime, consistent support of "middle-class tax cuts" then we would have have no quarrel with his description. But coming immediately after Gibbs' expression of "welcome" for "Boehner's change in position," we feel that a reasonable person might conclude that Boehner had previously opposed middle-class tax cuts and now supports them. And suggesting that would be inaccurate, since Boehner has not wavered in his support of extending the middle-class portion of the tax cuts. So we think it is a stretch for Gibbs to say Boehner has changed his position. It's very clear that Boehner still supports extending the tax cuts for people of all incomes. He was asked how he would vote under a very specific scenario and he answered the question. Yes, Boehner added a new aspect to that position -- that he's willing to support the other extensions even if they don't cover the wealthiest Americans. But in the same interview and elsewhere, Boehner has repeatedly said he supports extending the tax cuts for all Americans. That's sounds like a lot of consistency with a bit of change thrown in. So we find Gibbs' claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00726	The Castro regime ‘violated international norms’ by secretly shipping weapons to North Korea in violation of a U.N. embargo.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/24/david-perdue/Perdue-mostly-right-on-shady-weapons-deal/	The White House announced last week that President Barack Obama would be eliminating a major obstacle to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba by removing it from America’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Since 1982, Cuba has been on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation it has shared with Syria, Sudan and Iran and that triggers sanctions limiting U.S. aid, defense exports and certain financial transactions. Supporters say this is a necessary step if Obama is going to turn the page on the Cold War-era dispute that has snarled diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba for more than five decades. Some Republicans, including freshman U.S. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, object to taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism. "The Castro regime, time and again, has violated international norms,’ Perdue, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement issued the day after the White House announcement. "I am deeply concerned that President Obama continues to embolden our enemies and empower dictators from Russia to Iran, and now Cuba. Cuba must prove it is willing to change its destructive and oppressive behavior before the United States removes it as a state sponsor of terrorism. He cited several examples of Cubas destructive and oppressive behavior, including an incident in 2013 when, he said, Cuba secretly shipped 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea, violating a U.N.embargo. PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Perdue’s statement about the weapons shipment. We reached out to Mark Bednar, a Perdue spokesman, who sent us several news accounts of the incident where aging Cuban weapons were found aboard a North Korean-flagged ship. In July 2013, Fox News reported that Panamanian officials stopped the ship Chong Chon Gang ferrying undeclared weapons and armaments, including two Soviet-era MiG fighters and surface-to-air missile system, from Cuba, in apparent violation of U.N. sanctions. The weapons were hidden under 200,000 bags of sugar. The report said the Cuban government acknowledged about a day later that the cargo included 240 metric tons of "obsolete defensive weapons." Government officials claimed the equipment was meant to be repaired in North Korea and returned to Cuba. Three members of the ship’s crew were arrested on arms trafficking charges. The ship was allowed to return to Cuba in 2014 after a $700,000 fine was paid, the BBC reported. A State Department spokesperson told us this week that the administration considers the weapons shipment to North Korea in 2013 an "egregious violation of U.N. sanctions." The administration, the spokesperson said, has worked to ensure that those responsible "pay a price for their wrongdoing." "The administration also worked to maximize the diplomatic cost to Cuba for its role in the incident, including repeatedly condemning Cuba’s role in the violation in meetings of the UN Security Council," she said. "While Cuba’s actions were a clear violation of international law, they do not constitute support for acts of international terrorism and do not constitute a bar to rescission of their (state sponsor of terrorism) designation." Cuban was placed on the list in 1982 because of its efforts to promote revolution in the Western Hemisphere. North Korea spent 20 years on the list but was removed in 2008 by President George W. Bush. North Korea was placed on the list in 1988 for planting a bomb on a passenger plane headed from Baghdad to Seoul. The plane exploded south of Burma, and all on board were killed. In the current review of Cuba’s standing, the administration focused on ‘the narrow question of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six months and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission," the State Department spokeswoman said.. A senior administration official told reporters earlier this month that Cuban leaders, including Fidel and Raul Castro, have repeatedly and publicly decried terrorist acts. Congress has 45 days from receiving the president’s report to pass a joint resolution prohibiting the rescission. If that would occur, the president would have veto power and Congress the power of the veto override. Our conclusion Georgia Sen. David Perdue said he objects to plans to take Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that was announced last week by the White House. He said that the Castro regime in Cuba has violated international norms. Among the specific examples he cited was Cuba "secretly shipping 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea in 2013 in violation of a U.N. embargo." News reports and statements from the administration back up Perdue’s claim about the incident. The administration said it narrowly focused on whether Cuban provided any support for international terrorism in the prior six months and whether the Cuban government had provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, That is context the reader needs. For that reason, we rate Perdue's statement Mostly True.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2015-04-24T00:00:00	2015-04-15	['United_Nations', 'North_Korea']
pomt-09304	The financial services regulatory bill "will end taxpayer bailouts."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/21/harry-reid/reid-says-financial-regulation-bill-will-end-taxpa/	As the long-awaited bill to curb risk and excess on Wall Street nears a Senate vote, key Republicans and Democrats have sparred over what the bill does and does not do. Much of the debate has been over whether the bill stops or encourages "bailouts." This became a special focus of attention after Republican pollster Frank Luntz advised opponents of regulation that "the single best way to kill any legislation is to link it to the Big Bank Bailout." In an April 19, 2010, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that the bill "will end taxpayer bailouts." That came a few days after Reid's Republican counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at an April 14 press conference, "In fact, if you look at it carefully, it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks." McConnell added that the bill "actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks" and that it sets up "in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions." In a separate item, we ruled McConnell's statement False. Here, we'll tackle Reid's claim. First, some background on the financial regulations now under consideration in the Senate, with the caveat that the bill is something of a moving target. There are separate House and Senate versions, and once a unified version becomes law, there may be specific regulatory aspects delegated to federal agencies. That said, the Senate bill would grant the government additional authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds. It would establish a new consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve to regulate financial products, and it would create a process for federal authorities to dissolve financial institutions that are teetering on collapse. On this last point, the bill would set up a panel of three bankruptcy judges to convene and agree within 24 hours whether a large financial company is insolvent. If a "systematically significant" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate the firm, using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms. The FDIC "shall impose assessments on a graduated basis, with financial companies having greater assets being assessed at a higher rate," according to the legislation. We should clarify that there will be no change for small, mid-sized and even fairly large banks; when they're in trouble, there's already a well-established mechanism, under FDIC authority, that is not considered a bailout. Instead, the "bailouts" at issue are those for the small number of very large, highly interconnected institutions -- those sometimes called "too big to fail" because their collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy. The legislative language is very specific about the money being used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says: "In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary." There is some speculation that the industry-financed fund, envisioned to be $50 billion, could be dropped from the bill, since it wasn't in the White House's original proposal. But the provision was still in the bill when Reid spoke, so we'll factor it into our analysis. A big challenge in analyzing Reid's statement, or any like it, is figuring out what exactly the word "bailout" means. "It is almost impossible to pin politicians down on this one because 'bailout' has no clear meaning," said Douglas Elliott, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank. "It could cover a very wide range of things, some of which involve taxpayer money and some don't, and some of which are traditional central banking or deposit insurer roles and others of which are novel." Free-market purists may see any intervention of the government into the financial sector as a "bailout." However, we think the more common understanding of the word means that the federal government gives or lends a company taxpayer money to help it stay in business. Merriam-Webster, for example, defines a bailout as "a rescue from financial distress." We don't see how the liquidation of a company could constitute a "rescue." In fact, the bill would pay for the so-called "orderly liquidation" by assessing a fine on the firms themselves, not by using general revenue, a situation somewhat similar to the way the FDIC has handled failing banks for many years now, using fees it collects from other banks to pay for orderly shut-downs. So, if we use our preferred definition, does the bill truly "end taxpayer bailouts"? We spoke to a variety of financial-services experts, and most (though not all) agreed that the bill would be a step in the right direction, in all likelihood reducing the risk of the government having to undertake another bailout. That's the case in part because the bill aims to heighten regulation in advance so that problems don't emerge in the first place. Still, even those who felt favorable toward the bill's aims found Reid's statement to be too definitive. For a truly large and interconnected institution, several sources said, $50 billion probably won't be enough to do an "orderly liquidation." Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University, said that given past history, that figure is "laughable" and that "$300 billion would be the minimum reasonable starting point." And if the danger to the wider economy from a potential collapse is perceived to be big enough, the federal government will probably bite the bullet and lend some financial support, our sources agreed. "No matter who is in charge, administration officials faced with the threat of a systemic/liquidity event will feel the need to 'pull out all the stops' to avoid it – in which case, at that moment, they may actually be justified," said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The bill gives "somewhat wide latitude" that makes a "straightforward unwinding unlikely," Thallam said. "Any little bit of light underneath the door will inevitably be exploited." Ultimately, our sources agreed that while the bill makes aggressive efforts to reduce the likelihood of bailouts, it doesn't make them illegal. And short of, say, passing a constitutional amendment ruling out bailouts, any future Congress or administration would be able to act as conditions demanded. "Nothing, not even a bill by Mr. McConnell, would rule out bailouts," said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. "There's no realistic legislation that could absolutely guarantee no bailouts." Finally, a word about Reid's reference to "taxpayer." It's true that the bill, as of now, would use an industry fund to pay for winding down troubled companies, meaning taxpayers would not be directly involved. But James Gattuso, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, writes that whether the money comes from other banks or from taxpayers is "a distinction without a difference," since the costs would eventually be passed on to consumers. In addition, Peter J. Wallison, a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, added that the message communicated to financial services firms -- that someone will be there to help you out if you get in trouble -- undercuts the bill's stated effort to reduce lending risks and prevent institutions from becoming "too big to fail." When we contacted Reid's staff to elaborate on his comment, a spokesman cited an interview with Sheila Bair, the head of the FDIC who was appointed by George W. Bush and who continues to head the agency under President Barack Obama. Asked whether the bill would "stop" bailouts from happening, Bair responded, "It makes them impossible and it should. We worked really hard to squeeze bailout language out of this bill." We agree that the bill takes genuine steps toward reducing bailouts. But we find it a stretch to argue, as Reid does, that the bill will "end" them. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-04-21T13:27:38	2010-04-19	['None']
pomt-13812	"Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/18/rick-saccone/curious-connection-between-illicit-cigarette-sales/	Are loosies a terrorist revenue stream? State Rep. Rick Saccone thinks so. During a session ahead of a vote on the state budget’s revenue package last week, Saccone, a Republican from Allegheny County, objected to a proposed $1-per-pack cigarette tax increase Wednesday. The new tax, which Governor Wolf signed into law later that day, raises the state’s levy to $2.60 per pack. Saccone viewed this as earning revenue off the backs of the poor, but also he was wary that price hikes might encourage smuggling rings that send money to violent extremists. "We as a legislature are not only ready to trample on the poor, who disproportionately bear the burden of that tax," he told the body, "we’re prepared to disregard the ugly consequence that driving the price too high nurtures illegal tobacco sales, which have been connected to funding terrorism against us. I’ll say that again, folks: Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half." Saccone wasn’t the only representative to raise such concerns. "Interstate 81 is a smuggler’s alley. Now Pennsylvania will be a stop on Smuggler’s Alley," State Rep. Russ Diamond, a Republican from Lebanon County, said earlier in his remarks. "And what kind of folks are in the cigarette smuggling business and what else do they do with their money? Are they also involved in other illegal activities? Are they involved in human trafficking? Are they funding Hezbollah or ISIS? We don’t know." Later, in an interview with PolitiFact PA, Saccone pointed to a noteworthy 2015 State Department report, "The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: A Threat to National Security." "Internationally, it fuels transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism," the report’s authors wrote. "The illicit trade in tobacco products remains a lucrative revenue stream for many criminal actors and illicit networks." Is it fair to consider price hikes drivers? David Merriman, a University of Chicago researcher who studies how consumers react to cigarette taxes, said in an email, "There is high quality scientific evidence that relatively high cigarette taxes/prices are associated with increased illicit sales." Saccone said the while many details may be classified, the links from reported probes are clear. "We know that these terrorist organizations are branching out and they’re using multiple activities to fund their operations, especially in foreign countries," he said. "I’m not saying the sale of cigarettes is the only source… but we know we can tie, according to these government reports and some of these operations, at least some of cigarette smuggling to the funding of terrorism." Many of the examples in the State Department report, and many of the examples we found through broader research, were not domestic. One-eyed Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, also known as the "Marlboro Man," has entered the realm of legend not only for his prowess as a cigarette smuggler across Northern Africa, but also because U.S. intelligence has yet to confirm whether he’s actually dead or not. In 2004, an anti-terrorism law passed that prohibits importing missiles made specifically to blow up planes. The first person convicted under this law was Yi Qing Chen, a top smuggler in a Chinese crime ring that was busted in two connected probes: Operation Smoking Dragon and Operation Royal Charm, the latter being a FBI-staged yacht wedding where the lucky couple were actually undercover agents, and the suspects were invited guests. Chen, who was the arrested in Operation Smoking Dragon, had smuggled counterfeit money, military-grade weapons, methamphetamines, cigarettes and missiles, among other items. It’s not extraordinary to say that internationally, organized crime rings have developed far-reaching black market networks, illicit cigarettes being one of the industries. But how common is the case Saccone described— a black market growing thanks to the higher cigarette prices found in a particular state, and that market funnelling money to violent extremists? According to Understanding the U.S. Illicit Tobacco Market: Characteristics, Policy Context, and Lessons from International Experiences, 226-page National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study, not that common: "Overall, given the total number of terrorism-related tobacco investigations in the United States (keeping in mind that smuggling cases are likely to receive priority if they can be linked to terrorism), as well as the dollar amounts involved in those cases, the link between the U.S. illicit tobacco market and terrorism appears to be minor." From the 2002 and 2003 fiscal years, the report states, out of nearly 300 tobacco cases at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), only eight were "linked to terrorism." As the report notes, the underground market evades a good deal of statistical reporting. And while many investigations may look at both terrorist affiliations and illicit tobacco, both charges don’t always stick. Take the Knoxville man who pleaded guilty to cigarette smuggling in 2010. The FBI began investigating him after wiretapping conversations in which he seemed like an Al Qaeda recruiter. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, the terror charge fell to the wayside after a lie-detector test backed his explanation: that on the phone calls, he was merely kidding. We reached out to ATF for cases that had led to convictions on both counts. ATF pointed to the 25 indictments resulting from Operation Smokescreen, which focused on an interstate cigarette smuggling ring. This group of illegal tobacco traders in North Carolina and Michigan operated primarily in the late ’90s, led to multiple arrests and convictions for cigarette smuggling and assisting Hezbollah. (One of the men, according to the Village Voice, donated $3,500 to the combatant group.) Arrests were made from 2000 to 2002. We found another example. Reportedly, a cigarette smuggler helped the Lackawanna Six, a group of Yemeni-American friends who were Al-Qaeda trainees, finance their trip to training camp in Afghanistan. Some of the men allegedly had smuggled cigarettes themselves. They were arrested in 2002, the magic number in both investigations -- which means 15 years is not out of the realm of possibility. These are the most high-profile examples of domestic cigarette smuggling connected to terrorism financing post-2001. We weren’t able to find more recent cases. "[T]here is also no systematic evidence of sustained links between the global illicit tobacco trade and terrorism," according to the report. Our ruling Rep. Saccone said in a house session, "Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half." Most of the trouble with this statement are its implications: American cigarette smuggling does not have strong presence in terrorism financing. Saccone himself admitted that he had heard of no such incidence in Philadelphia, where a cigarette tax bumped prices up in 2014. But, there have been cases, as he mentioned. In our research and from our correspondence with ATF, we were only able to find two groups that had financed terrorist activities through illicit tobacco sale, the Lackawanna Six and an interstate North Carolina-Michigan smuggling ring, both leading to multiple convictions. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Saccone	None	None	None	2016-07-18T08:55:00	2016-07-13	['None']
pomt-01211	"Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds. In the ‘30s, they weighed 13.2 pounds."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/25/mother-jones/turkeys-today-are-more-twice-fat-they-were-1930s-m/	On one of our regular cruises of political websites, we came across this from Mother Jones: "Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds," the liberal magazine stated on its Facebook page. "In the ‘30s, they weighed 13.2 pounds." The claim was posted Nov. 24, 2014, three days before Thanksgiving. It made our mouths water and, well, whet our appetite for some holiday fact-checking. The Facebook post linked to an article posted the same day on Mother Jones’ website. The article, in turn, linked to a November 2013 report from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economics & Statistics Administration. That report contained the figures Mother Jones cited, saying turkeys have more than doubled in weight -- from an average of 13.2 pounds in 1929 to 29.8 pounds in 2012. We found that, if anything, Mother Jones might be light on its claim. The average weight for 2013 is actually a half-pound higher, at 30.3 pounds, according to Michael Klamm, an agricultural statistician at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. However, the 2012 figure cited by Mother Jones is considered final, whereas the 2013 figure is still subject to revision, Klamm told us. So, how’d turkeys get so fat? Mother Jones reported that the size of turkeys has grown, particularly since the 1950s, as the nation’s poultry operations began to breed turkeys for size in order to meet Americans’ demand for meat. In government-speak, the Department of Commerce said the increase "is a result of large increases in turkey industry productivity due to technological innovations in turkey breeding and specialization in turkey raising methods." Among the key factors: artificial insemination. "The modern bird is too heavy and misshapen to procreate the old-fashioned way," The Atlantic magazine reported the day before Thanksgiving 2013. "And A.I. means that good genetic material can be easily spread around." But it’s almost Thanksgiving Day. Is turkey OK to eat? "If you are looking for a lean cut of meat, turkey is hard to beat," according to Harvard Medical School. "A 3-ounce serving of skinless white meat contains 26 grams of protein, barely 2 grams of fat, and under 1 gram of saturated fat," and "it’s healthy on the heart." Phew. Now don’t call us late for dinner. Our rating Mother Jones magazine said: "Turkeys today weigh 29.8 pounds. In the ‘30s, they weighed 13.2 pounds." Those, in fact, are the latest-available federal figures. "Today" is actually a reference to 2012, but the preliminary figure for 2013 is even higher, at 30.3 pounds. We rate the statement True.

pomt-08366	Says Lloyd Doggett voted for the health care, stimulus and cap-and-trade bills.	true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/26/donna-campbell/donna-campbell-says-rep-lloyd-doggett-voted-health/	Seeking to unseat U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, Republican nominee Donna Campbell of Columbus paints him as a "career politician" with some questionable positions. In an ad posted online Oct. 19, the narrator compares Doggett and Campbell, an "emergency room doctor." "They disagree on ObamaCare: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says repeal. Stimulus spending: Doggett voted yes, Dr. Campbell says it's a waste of money. Cap and trade: Doggett voted yes, Campbell says job killer." We're not weighing in on whether the stimulus was a waste of money, or if cap and trade is a job killer. But since earlier this month we rated True Doggett's statement that he voted against "big bank bailouts," we were curious whether Campbell accurately recapped his votes on other high-dollar issues. Amanda Tyler, Doggett's campaign manager, told us by e-mail that Doggett voted for each piece of legislation, though the campaign has reservations about the visuals in Campbell's ad; for example, she said, a shot of a foreclosure sign doesn't make sense in connection with his vote for stimulus aid. Let's review Doggett's votes one at a time. Health care On Nov. 7, 2009, the U.S. House voted on its version of health care legislation in a 220-215 vote. Doggett joined 218 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Anh Cao of Louisiana, in passing the legislation. On March 21, 2010 , Doggett voted for legislation reconciling Senate and House versions of the proposal. The compromise passed 220-211, with no Republicans in support. Doggett said in a floor speech "with this reform, every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured." We later rated that statement as True. Stimulus On Jan. 28, 2009, the House passed the $819 billion economic recovery bill 244-188 without a single Republican vote. Doggett voted "aye." "One way this bill promotes economic recovery is by promoting educational opportunity," he said on the House floor the day before. "$13.5 billion of targeted tax relief to help young people and not-so young people attend college. Today, one out of five graduating high school students does not qualify for this assistance. But because we provided a refundable tax credit, we help them, just as the appropriations section of this bill helps with expanded Pell Grants and other direct aid." We asked Campbell's campaign why it showed an image of foreclosure sign while describing Doggett's vote for the stimulus legislation. Mike Asmus, Campbell's campaign manager, told us "the stimulus spending Lloyd Doggett has voted for has prolonged the narrative of economic malaise, running from joblessness to foreclosure and beyond." Cap and trade Doggett voted for a cap-and-trade measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. With Doggett's vote, that proposal cleared the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009, though Doggett also aired objections about the measure being too soft, saying the plan stripped too much oversight from the Environmental Protection Agency and encouraged new coal-fired plants. "I struggled deeply about whether to support this flawed bill, but I finally determined that voting for it was my best hope for making it better," he said on the floor that day. "I've been listening to the debate — not so much to those who support a bill that I'm not all that enthusiastic about, but listening to the Flat Earth Society and the climate-change deniers, and some of the most inane arguments I have heard against refusing to act on this vital national security challenge." Tyler also told us that Doggett hoped to improve the bill by being tapped to serve as a House member of a possible House-Senate conference committee on the plan. That panel never was named; the House-approved bill stalled in the Senate. Our vote? The ad's imagery might be objectionable (at least to Doggett). He still gave his 'aye' for all the legislation cited by Campbell. We rate her statement True.	None	Donna Campbell	None	None	None	2010-10-26T06:00:00	2010-10-19	['None']
pomt-09589	Members of Congress passed a pay raise for themselves of $10,000 over two years even as they voted not to raise Social Security benefits for 2010 and 2011.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/22/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-congress-raised-own-salaries-whi/	It is now conventional wisdom that American voters are angry -- very angry. And few things set them off as much as perks for lawmakers and the denial of benefits for seniors. A chain e-mail ties together these two hot-button issues and runs with them. The version we received reads, in part: "U.S. House & Senate have voted themselves $4,700 and $5,300 raises. "1. They voted to not give you a [Social Security] Cost of living raise in 2010 and 2011. "2. Your Medicaid premiums will go up $285.60 for the 2-years and You will not get the 3% COLA: $660/yr. Your total 2-yr loss and cost is -$1,600 or -$3,200 for husband and wife. "3. Over 2-yrs they [Members of Congress] each get $10,000 "4. Do you feel SCREWED? "5. Will they have your cost of drugs - doctor fees - local taxes - food, etc., increase? NO WAY . They have a raise and better benefits. Why care about you? You never did anything about it in the past. You obviously are too stupid or don't care." The e-mail closes with a call to action on the 2010 midterm elections: "SEND THE MESSAGE -- You're FIRED." Let's take these claims one by one: A congressional pay raise Under a law in force for two decades, members of Congress are entitled to a pay raise every year unless they vote to reject it. For two out of the past four years, lawmakers have voted to decline their cost-of-living increase. In votes taken in 2006 and 2009 -- affecting their pay during 2007 and 2010, respectively -- lawmakers turned down the pay raise. In 2007 and 2008, however, lawmakers didn't act to reject their pay raise, so their salaries increased -- by $4,100 for 2008 and by $4,700 for 2009. That boosted the rank-and-file congressional salary to its current level of $174,000. (Leaders in both chambers get more.) So it's true that Congress has acted (or, more precisely, failed to act) in a way that increased lawmaker salaries. But if you compare apples to apples by focusing on the most recent two-year period, as the e-mail does with the Social Security COLA (cost-of-living adjustment), congressional salaries in 2009 and 2010 increased by $4,700 -- less than half of what the e-mail alleged. Bottom line: The e-mail is partly right. Lawmakers did raise their salaries, but by less than the e-mail said. A cost-of-living increase for Social Security In September, PolitiFact looked at an earlier chain e-mail that claimed that "for the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the Social Security COLA." We'll recap and update our original analysis here. Until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 -- and signed by President Richard Nixon -- created a formula to automatically calculate the COLA every year. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Every year since the formula was put into effect, it has resulted in a cost-of-living increase. In fact, high oil prices in the summer of 2008 helped produce a sizable COLA increase in January 2009 of 5.8 percent -- the highest increase in more than 25 years. But lower energy prices and the effects of the recession combined to reduce the CPI-W during the period used to calculate the 2010 Social Security COLA. So in a break with tradition, there was no COLA for Social Security recipients this year. And projections by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that there won't be a COLA for Social Security recipients in 2011, either. But as we stated in our analysis of the earlier e-mail, this process occurs without any intervention by Congress. So it's incorrect to say, as the current e-mail does, that Congress "voted to not give you a [Social Security] cost of living raise in 2010 and 2011." In addition, CBO projections aside, it's not yet official that Social Security beneficiaries won't get a COLA for 2011. The statistics that determine whether that will happen won't be calculated for another 10 months or so. Finally, several bills are pending in Congress that would provide seniors with additional money to make up for the lack of a Social Security COLA this year. The bills -- S. 1685, H.R. 3536, H.R. 3557, H.R. 4429, H.R. 3572 and H.R. 3536 -- are being offered by both Democrats and Republicans, and most of them would provide recipients with additional payments of $150 or $250. President Barack Obama is on record saying that he supports the idea of a $250 one-time payment to seniors. As of yet, none has advanced beyond the committee stage. How big could the hit from a lost COLA be? For someone who has a $3,054 monthly benefit -- a comparatively generous amount, based on what a steady earner at the maximum level would get every month if he or she had retired in 2009 at age 70 -- would lose $1,099 over the course of the year compared to what they'd get with a 3 percent COLA. But most recipients would take a much smaller hit, according to Social Security Administration tables. Bottom line: On this point too, the e-mail is partly right. Social Security recipients won't be getting a COLA in 2010, and they are projected not to receive one for 2011, either. But it's inaccurate to blame Congress for that -- and the e-mail fails to note that the president and many lawmakers are working to provide a COLA to seniors retroactively. Increases in premiums for Medicare Let's get one thing clear before we start: It's not Medicaid premiums the e-mail writer meant. It's Medicare premiums. Americans age 65 and older get their health coverage through Medicare and pay monthly premiums to support Part B of the program -- coverage for outpatient services, including physician visits. These premiums are subtracted from a recipient's Social Security check. Part B premiums typically rise every year, but in the past, the annual increase in Social Security benefits has generally exceeded the annual rise in Part B premiums, meaning that the amount of a recipient's Social Security check has risen year after year despite the Part B increases. With the absence of a Social Security COLA this year, the rise in Part B premiums threatens, for the first time, to reduce the amount in Social Security checks compared to the prior year. But we need to raise a couple of caveats. Under a so-called "hold-harmless" law, 73 percent of Social Security beneficiaries are protected from any reduction in Social Security benefits caused by a rise in Part B premiums. Another 17 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid, and under current law, Medicaid -- not the recipient -- covers the higher Part B premium. And another 3 percent are new enrollees in Social Security or Medicare. While they will pay the higher Part B premiums, they won't see any change in their Social Security check amount because they either weren't getting Social Security checks last year or weren't enrolled in Medicare last year. So, the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries will see the amount in their Social Security checks stay the same, rather than decline, due to this year's Part B premium increases. Those who will see a decrease in their Social Security check -- about 5 percent of Medicare enrollees -- are generally those who have a modified adjusted gross income greater than $85,000 (for individuals) or $170,000 (for couples). For these recipients, the typical year-to-year increase in Part B premiums will be $14.10 per month. That works out to be $169.20 additional per year for an individual, or $338.40 additional for a couple -- levels far below what the e-mail alleged. Meanwhile, there's one additional factor that could cut into Social Security benefits: an increase in premiums for Medicare Part D, the part that covers prescription drugs. The impact from Medicare Part D premium hikes will vary widely because it's a voluntary program and because enrollees may choose among a variety of plans, each with different levels of benefits and premiums. One estimate cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that 1.2 million beneficiaries could see their Part D premiums rise this year by at least $10 a month -- a change that would mean dollar-for-dollar reductions in their Social Security checks. That's about 3 percent of those enrolled in Medicare as a whole. A larger number of beneficiaries could see smaller monthly changes. Bottom line: The e-mail is correct that the absence of a Social Security COLA this year will affect Medicare premiums (even though it mistakenly called them Medicaid premiums). However, the vast majority of beneficiaries will see no reductions in their Social Security checks, and the relatively small proportion who do see a decliine -- many of them at the higher end of the income scale -- are likely to see increases far smaller than those alleged in the e-mail. Summary As with many chain e-mails we've seen, this one takes nuggets of truth and distorts them, adding several layers of inaccuracies. For one thing, the losses suggested in the e-mail are on the higher end of the scale. If the recently retired high-earner who was cited above also got hit by both types of premium increases, he or she would stand to lose $1,389 for the year. If his or her spouse was in the same situation, they would lose a combined $2,778. That's not so far off from the $1,600 to $3,200 claimed by the e-mail. But it's also for an extreme case. For most recipients, the hit would be much smaller. So let's recap. To its credit, the e-mail is correct that Congress has acted to increase its own pay, that Social Security recipients will not see a cost-of-living increase this year and that some recipients may in fact see a decrease in their checks from rising Medicare premiums. But the e-mail got many key details wrong. It cherry-picked its data in a way that overstated the increase in congressional salaries; it wrongly blamed Congress for killing the Social Security COLA (when in fact many lawmakers and the president are working to reverse that development); it vastly overstated the number of people who will be hit by rising Medicare premiums; and it used an extreme case in constructing its example of income being lost. If the author of the e-mail had been more careful in vetting the statistics, this missive could have been informative. But since the author was not, we will rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08745	"The Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014," including "each individual’s Body Mass Index."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/30/ann-marie-buerkle/ann-marie-buerkle-gop-candidate-says-under-new-hea/	It sounds like a claim from a chain e-mail, but it's posted on the website of a Republican candidate for Congress. Is Big Brother really going to keep tabs on your flab? The charge was posted in a letter dated Aug. 10, 2010, on the website of Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican who is seeking to oust Rep. Dan Maffei, a freshman Democrat representing a district in upstate New York. The letter, addressed to "Dear Friends," was signed by the candidate herself. It said, "You may have noticed the latest 'product' from big government advocates in Washington. We now know the Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014, and will include information on each individual’s Body Mass Index in the files. Some argue that an individual’s Body Mass Index indicates whether that person is dieting and exercising properly. We may all prefer healthy life styles, but I don’t believe the federal government needs to be involved in such personal matters. Instead, I advocate personal accountability and personal responsibility." Buerkle -- who describes herself on her campaign website as a "nurse and accomplished attorney working in health care," added, "I believe this is an unacceptable intrusion by government into the private lives of Americans. It is costly, and susceptible to abuse. As the financial burden and unbearable strain of Obamacare has started to take its toll on healthcare costs, such information like BMI can eventually be used to help government bureaucrats to ration health care. Even if that’s not the case, I’m opposed to the expansion of federal bureaucracies, out-of-control spending, tax increases, and increasing dependency on government." We wondered whether the federal government is really planning to snoop on people's body mass index, which, in certain ranges, can be a predictor of costly, debilitating and even deadly diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. As we first related in a fact-check in October 2009, computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that electronic medical records will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments. They also hope that, in the long term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care. The effort did not begin with President Barack Obama. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the adoption of information technology by 2014, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. Under Obama, Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote health information technology, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers, typically through higher Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for doctors who use electronic medical records effectively. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a "network of networks." All the experts we spoke to emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed. So will an intrusive government will have access to your private medical information? The short answer is: No. "The records would be held by physicians and providers -- there is no such 'federal health record' on all Americans being compiled by the government," said Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a group that follows electronic privacy issues. The Department of Health and Human Services "is not establishing a record for each person -- they are administering a program whereby physicians and hospitals can establish electronic medical records for their patients." In July 2010, HHS issued its first in a series of final regulations on how the incentive program for medical professionals will work, covering 2011 and 2012. Among other things, doctors will have to record body mass index as one of a number of statistics included in the new electronic medical record. (Click here to see a summary of the full list.) "This information is going into the physician or hospital's medical record, where it is considered confidential and subject to ethical and legal protections against inappropriate use and disclosure," McGraw said. "It is not information going into a government record." So, doctors have to track body mass index on the new electronic forms and report adult weight data to the government in order to receive their incentive payments. Why isn't Buerkle right? Because providers will be reporting information on patients' vital statistics only in aggregate, not with any personal identification attached. So while the federal government will have a new, large data set on Americans' weight, it will not know who weighs how much. "I question how the government could obtain information -- let alone current information -- on BMI or other health status of everyone even if there was a desire to do so," said Marty Robins, an Illinois-based attorney and adjunct law professor at Northwestern and DePaul universities who has expressed concerns about how safe electronic records will be from hackers. When we showed Buerkle's letter to HHS, spokeswoman Jessica Santillo called the allegations "false." Meanwhile, Glenn Laffel, senior vice president for clinical affairs at Practice Fusion, a company that helps doctors conform to electronic medical records regulations, calls Buerkle's charge "hogwash." "The federal government has legitimate concerns about the obesity epidemic in this country because this condition increases Medicare and Medicaid expenditures," Laffel said. "But its efforts to deal with the crisis don’t include anything like the assertions being made" in Buerkle's letter. Pamela Snyder, Buerkle's campaign manager, said the campaign stands by the letter. For starters, Snyder said in an e-mail, the information in these files may be subject to unauthorized access or hacking, potentially making them accessible "not simply a doctor and patient, but by health plans, hospitals, other doctors, pharmacies, insurance payors and government regulators." In the campaign's view, she said, "there are extremely serious privacy issues involved." On that point, few would disagree. Indeed, this question has prompted much interest -- and legislative and regulatory activity. But while the experts we spoke to were among those expressing concerns about privacy and security, they didn't interpret Buerkle's letter as focusing on privacy concerns. We don't either. While the letter does mention in passing that the system is "susceptible to abuse," Buerkle's letter discusses in much greater detail, and much more forceful language, about a federal bureaucracy that is intruding too deeply into Americans' private lives. Snyder also said the campaign "never stated that the (electronic health records) would be compiled in a government file -- only that the government was moving to make sure those files were compiled and contained certain information." We think that this more restrained interpretation -- which is pretty close to accurate -- is undermined by Buerkle's own words, including such phrases as "big government," "unacceptable intrusion by government into the private lives of Americans" and "expansion of federal bureaucracies." We believe a reasonable person would infer that when Buerkle says that "the Obama Health and Human Services Department is planning to compile a federal health record on all U.S. citizens by 2014," including "each individual’s Body Mass Index," she means that federal officials will have access to each person's BMI. That is not at all what is envisioned. As a result, we rate the claim False.	None	Ann Marie Buerkle	None	None	None	2010-08-30T16:49:34	2010-08-10	['United_States']
pomt-14169	"ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/27/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-isis-not-making-millions-dollars-w/	Libya’s violence and political instability has vexed the United States and other major powers since long-serving ruler Col. Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed forces in 2011. Security experts say the turmoil has allowed ISIS to gain a foothold in the North African country, allowing the jihadists a haven from which to train and plan attacks abroad. And while ISIS is blamed for attacking Libya’s oil fields in recent months, experts strongly disagree with a claim GOP frontrunner Donald Trump repeated on April 27 during his foreign policy speech in Washington. "And now ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil," Trump said in the speech. Our research Experts and news articles say ISIS has attacked Libya’s oil fields to disrupt oil markets and prevent rival groups from making a profit. But, they say, the group does not have the ability to operate the country’s few and complex oil refineries. This all contradicts Trump’s assertion. David Mack, an expert on Libya and terrorism with the nonpartisan Middle East Institute, called Trump’s claim "absolutely untrue." "I don’t know where he got this gem of misinformation," he told PolitiFact. Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, also rejected Trump’s statement. Gazzini said in an email to PolitiFact: "While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields. "At the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues." Gazzini made the same comments to the Washington Post Fact Checker when it examined a similar comment Trump made on NBC’s Today show on April 21. The Post gave Trump four Pinocchios, which it reserves for only the biggest falsehoods. The West Point-based Combating Terrorism Center also examined the ISIS/Libyan oil question. In a March 17 report it stated: "It is simply hard for the Islamic State to do much in (Libya’s oil fields) beyond episodic attacks." Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request to explain his comment. Our ruling Trump said, "ISIS is making millions of dollars a week selling Libyan oil." Experts and news reports say ISIS has attacked Libya’s oil fields in recent months, amid the country’s instability. But they roundly reject Trump’s claim that ISIS jihadists based in that country have been able to seize, refine and sell the oil for "millions of dollars a week." Instead, they say, the terrorist group is focused on disrupting oil markets and preventing rivals from getting the oil in Libya.

pomt-13595	Says Donald Trump "has a long history of exporting jobs overseas."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/17/tammy-baldwin/does-donald-trump-have-long-record-exporting-jobs/	On his first campaign trip to Wisconsin as Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine was introduced at a Milwaukee brewery by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who drew contrasts between the Democratic ticket and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. "I know with Tim Kaine as vice president and Hillary Clinton in the White House, we will have partners bringing the focus back on good-paying jobs for all Americans," Baldwin said on Aug. 5, 2016, the same day Trump visited Green Bay. "Now, while Donald trump has a long history of exporting jobs overseas, I know that Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton will bring back good-paying jobs right here to Milwaukee. They will crack down on countries that cheat, like China. We need a vice president and a president who will go to bat for Wisconsin businesses, not look to send more jobs overseas." Does Trump have a long record of exporting jobs overseas? Creating jobs overseas rather than in the United States -- yes. Moving existing U.S. jobs overseas -- no. Made over there Let’s begin by noting Trump has employed many people in the United States. (CNNMoney put the figure at 34,000.) He serves as an executive for more than 500 companies; his Trump Organization owns a portfolio of buildings, hotels and golf courses in the United States (and around the world). But he also sells many Trump-label products that are made overseas, as shown by three previous fact checks by our partners, and by our own online browsing. Trump cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps, mirrors and neckties are made in China. Some of the ties are also made in Indonesia and Vietnam and some of the shirts in Bangladesh. Trump suits are made in Mexico, India and China. Trump vodka, distilled in the Netherlands. Furniture, made in Turkey. And his crystal barware, made in Slovenia (the home country of his wife, Melania). But when Clinton said Trump "doesn't make a thing in America," PolitiFact Pennsylvania’s rating was False. His campaign gear, some of his and other Trump-brand products, including bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are made in the United States. And PunditFact in October 2015 rated as Pants on Fire a claim that Trump’s iconic campaign hats are made in China (they’re made in America). The rest of the claim As for the rest of Baldwin’s claim, Trump did decide to have some of his products manufactured overseas, rather than in America. As the Washington Post reported, Trump in 2004 signed a deal with Phillips-Van Heusen, a manufacturer of affordable shirts. It was one of the first of many merchandise-licensing arrangements in which he attached his name to products made by foreign workers and sold in the United States. (PVH said in 2015 it was dropping the Trump line.) But it’s misleading to say he exported jobs, in that it’s not as though he created those jobs in the United States and then moved them overseas. Trump has complained that China manipulates its currency, making it more expensive to make products outside of China. Our rating Baldwin said Trump "has a long history of exporting jobs overseas." For more than a decade, Trump-brand products such as his clothing have been made overseas, although those were jobs that were created overseas, not U.S. jobs that were moved.

pomt-13313	Says "he fought Obama at the Supreme Court — and won."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/oct/07/josh-hawley/colleagues-back-hawleys-role-supreme-court-cases/	Throughout the primary and general election campaign, Republican Attorney General candidate Josh Hawley has made the claim that he's beaten the Obama administration at the Supreme Court twice, most notably in the Hobby Lobby case that allowed certain private companies to claim a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive requirement. "He fought Obama at the Supreme Court — and won," Hawley's campaign said in an ad. That's a pretty impressive claim, and something that has been questioned by others. So we wondered: What exactly was Hawley's involvement in these cases, and did he really take on President Barack Obama's administration? The briefs in each case tell us that yes, Hawley was involved in both the Hobby Lobby case as well as a case regarding an Evangelical Lutheran church and school. His name appears in both of these court documents, with his MU Law School office address listed. Hawley's initial involvement with a Supreme Court case was Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was decided in 2012. Hosanna-Tabor was a church and K-8 school located in Redford, Michigan. The lawsuit was over the firing of teacher Cheryl Perich, who was asked to resign in 2005 after being diagnosed with narcolepsy and being put on disability leave. School officials were worried Perich would be unable to complete her duties and had already hired a replacement by the time Perich received word from a doctor that she could return to work in a few months. Perich then threatened to sue the church under the Americans with Disabilities Act if they fired her. When the church did, she stuck to her word. The Supreme Court unanimously sided with Hosanna-Tabor in their ruling. The Hobby Lobby case, also known as Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, was very high profile, with the high court handing down its decision in 2014. It involved the Affordable Care Act's mandate that companies pay for insurance coverage for contraceptives. Burwell refers to Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, who was nominated for the position by President Barack Obama. Hobby Lobby, a privately held chain of arts and crafts stores, won the case in a 5-4 decision. We reached out to Hawley's campaign to find out exactly what his involvement in each of these cases was, but they declined our interview requests. They instead provided four statements about Hawley from others who worked on the two Supreme Court cases. It's relevant to note that all of these statements are from either October or September of 2015, just months after Hawley announced his campaign to seek office. They all praise Hawley for his work with either the Hobby Lobby or Hosanna-Tabor case and claim he was an integral part of the teams of lawyers. Praise from fellow team members "I was privileged to collaborate with Josh Hawley on the Hobby Lobby case," wrote Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general from 2004-08 and was the sole Hobby Lobby lawyer to present oral arguments in front of the court. "Josh was a valued member of the Hobby Lobby team, as reflected by the fact that his name was featured on the front cover of the brief," Clement went on to write. "I can say without hesitation that Josh Hawley was instrumental to obtaining the landmark victory that protects the religious liberty of all Americans," wrote Kyle Duncan, who served as lead counsel for Hobby Lobby during the case. "I personally consulted with Josh on numerous occasions about legal strategy throughout the case, and I would have been a fool not to ... The notion that Josh has somehow misrepresented his important contributions to the Hobby Lobby victory because he did not do the oral argument portion of the case in the Supreme Court is, frankly, preposterous." "We were — and continue to be — grateful for his involvement, which was essential to a victory for religious liberty at the Supreme Court," wrote Peter M. Dobelbower, who served as Hobby Lobby's General Counsel. "Josh served as co-counsel both in Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC (2012) and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014). In both cases, his work and Supreme Court expertise were critical to our success at every stage of the litigation," read a statement from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the public interest law firm that served as counsel to plaintiffs in both cases. Hawley’s role That's what Hawley's colleagues say, but we wanted to see what other information about Hawley's role exists. In a June 2014 interview about the Hobby Lobby case, Hawley said his involvement with the case came from his prior work with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the nonprofit law firm that works exclusively with religious liberty cases. "We like to say we’ve defended everybody from A to Z, from Anglicans to Zoroastrians," Hawley said in the interview. The Becket Fund served as lead counsel to Hobby Lobby during the case, with Hawley having remained counsel with the Fund. Richard Hammer, another guest on the interview, described Josh's work on the case as being "involved in preparing the brief on behalf of Hobby Lobby," which Hawley confirms. An article from PoliticMo in March 2014 announcing Hawley's joining of the case also describes him as "one of a dozen lawyers in Washington, D.C., this week on Hobby Lobby's behalf and has helped prepare briefs and oral arguments for the justices to consider." So while Hawley helped to prepare statements for the case, he never actually argued either case. In fact, according to a Supreme Court public information specialist we reached out to, Hawley wasn't admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court until May 26, 2015, well after both the Hosanna-Tabor and Hobby Lobby cases had been decided. Our ruling Hawley's campaign ads claim he "fought Obama at the Supreme Court — and won." Even though he did not make oral arguments or even appear before the justices, all the key players involved in the Hobby Lobby and Hosanna-Tabor cases say he played important, even instrumental, roles in shaping legal arguments and strategy. One case was a key ruling that limited the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of the Obama administration. The other ruling limited the the reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal law administered by the executive branch, headed by President Barack Obama. We find this claim to be Mostly True.	None	Josh Hawley	None	None	None	2016-10-07T10:00:24	2016-06-14	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-03621	In just six years, Georgia has dropped from first in the nation from a business-friendly legal climate to 24th.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/may/07/chris-clark/chamber-leader-errs-tort-reform-claim/	One of the state’s leading business boosters recently offered some advice he believes will help improve Georgia’s economy. The Peach State needs additional measures to ensure businesses get a fair shake in Georgia courtrooms. "Other states have passed even better tort reforms," Chris Clark, the president of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, told a group of business leaders at Berry College in Rome. Clark offered some statistics to back up his claim. Six years ago, Georgia was first in the nation from the standpoint of a friendly legal climate to do business, said Clark, according to the Rome News-Tribune. Today, Clark said, Georgia ranks 24th. A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to fact-check the claim, contending that Georgia was not No. 1 six years ago. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce compiles research and has released a report on state lawsuit climate in each year during the past decade, except 2009. The rankings are based on a number of factors, including treatment of tort and contract litigation, treatment of class-action lawsuits, punitive damages, judge impartiality and fairness. Last year, Georgia was ranked 24th, as Clark said. However, Georgia was ranked 31st in 2007. In 2006, Georgia was ranked 27th. Georgia ranked no higher than 24th in any year since 2002. The Georgia Legislature last changed its laws on tort reform in 2005, the chamber noted. When contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Joselyn Baker, a senior vice president for the Georgia Chamber, said that Clark erred in his remarks. "Chris did misspeak earlier," Baker told us. "As you can imagine, he gives a lot of speeches that contain a lot of data … and sometimes can make a mistake." She added: "That said – the point he was making does not change. Georgia made some significant progress with civil justice reform in 2005 that made a positive impact on our business climate. The Georgia Chamber believes that the legal environment is an important factor in location and expansion decisions and that we must continue to look for ways to ensure that businesses are treated fairly in the courts and that our state compares favorably with our economic competition." Our tipster, Chris Kelleher, spokesman for the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, said he contacted us because some chamber leaders have made similar claims in the past. Kelleher said in an email that Georgia is among "the top 10 most pro-business states in the country." Kelleher complained "the chamber continues to perpetuate its myth that our legal climate makes Georgia unattractive to businesses." To sum up, Clark said that in just six years, Georgia had fallen from first in the nation from a legal climate standpoint to do business to 24th. Georgia was most recently ranked 24th, as Clark said. But it has been nowhere near first, based on the study he used for his claim. Clark is right about the most recent ranking, but he was way off about Georgia previously being first.

pomt-08554	Texas has "a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/30/bill-white/bill-white-says-texas-has-higher-unemployment-rate/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White has charged Gov. Rick Perry with taking undue credit for Texas job growth and ducking the limelight when the economy looks bleak. Earlier this month, we rated True Perry's boast in a TV ad that Texas has created more jobs than the other states combined. "Does he accept responsibility for one million Texans unemployed and a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states?" White asked in a Sept. 27 e-mail. White's hammered the number of unemployed Texans before — in March, we rated True his claim that nearly 1 million Texans were unemployed, a state record. As of August, the number of unemployed crept up to 1,004,388, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. We wondered whether Texas has a higher unemployment rate than neighboring states. So we consulted the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks unemployment data in each state, to see how Texas compared to the four states it borders: New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. In August, Texas and New Mexico had an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent, followed by Louisiana (7.6 percent), Arkansas (7.5 percent), and Oklahoma (7 percent). Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Texas had a higher unemployment rate than three of the four adjacent states, and noted that "nearby states" Colorado and Kansas also had a lower rate (8.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively). Next, we looked at Augusts past starting in 2001, Perry's first full year in the governor's office. We found that Oklahoma and Louisiana have had lower unemployment rates, and until this year, New Mexico had a lower unemployment rate than Texas. Arkansas had a higher unemployment rate than Texas in 2006 to 2008. Nationally, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in August. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia had higher unemployment rates than Texas. Upshot: In August, Texas had a higher unemployment rate than Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, but not New Mexico. We rate White's statement as Mostly True.

pomt-06763	The proposed transportation bill "could be the largest tax increase in Georgia history."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/22/david-pennington/transportation-sales-tax-could-be-historic-wrong-r/	Dalton Mayor David Pennington is not on board with the idea of a penny-per-dollar sales tax to fund transportation projects. He fears a higher sales tax will encourage people to shop in nearby Tennessee and spend less money in his North Georgia city. And he really doesn’t like plans to hold a referendum in November 2012, as opposed to the initial idea of a vote on the transportation sales tax in July. The people trying to switch the date of the vote, Pennington said, are "obviously trying to get the Obama Democrats to help pass what could be the largest tax increase in Georgia history: $1.6 billion a year." Pennington’s problem with November 2012 is he believes it’s a sly attempt by referendum supporters to get more people likely to vote in favor of the sales tax to cast their ballots. The presidential election will be held in November, and more Democrats are likely to vote then as opposed to July, when election primaries are held. President Barack Obama is not expected to have a primary challenger. Interesting, but we were more curious about the latter part of his quote. Could this sales tax actually be the largest tax increase in state history? David Sjoquist, who frequently does research for state lawmakers as director of the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University, had several questions about Pennington’s claim, including these: What did the mayor mean by largest increase? In one year? Over the span of several years? "It’s a tricky comparison," Sjoquist said. Pennington said he was referring to the annual total it’s estimated that the tax could generate. The mayor remembered a presentation last year from state transportation officials that estimated the annual total at $1.6 billion. Georgia Transportation Department officials estimated in June that the sales tax would bring in an at least $1.4 billion a year. "I don’t even remember in my lifetime a tax that would be as much," Pennington told us. He added in a follow-up conversation: "I want everyone to know how big of a tax this is going to be." The last sizable tax increase of any kind that experts could remember occurred in 1989 when Georgia lawmakers increased the state sales tax from 3 percent to 4 percent. That tax was expected to raise at least $507 million a year. Sales tax revenue increased by about $613 million between 1989 and 1990, state economist Ken Heaghney said, although he pointed out that some of that revenue came from an increase in sales activity in Georgia. Sales tax revenue declined slightly the next two years but has grown steadily in the following years. Jeff Humphreys, the director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, noted that the sales tax increase was approved with an exemption on food. "That [sales tax] increase was not as large as it seemed," Humphreys said. There have been a handful of other major tax increases in past decades. But revenue records are hard to find, so it is difficult to say whether others had a bigger financial impact than the proposed transportation sales tax. The last time Georgia’s motor fuel tax was raised was in 1971, by a penny. The corporate tax rate was last changed in 1969, with an increase from 5 percent to 6 percent. Georgia’s income tax was created during the Great Depression. Georgia created its sales tax in 1951 and set the rate at 3 percent. Total state revenue collections rose from $145.3 million in 1951 to $220.5 million in 1952, a $75 million difference. Adjusted for inflation, that is about $600 million in today’s dollars. We believe it’s safe to say that much of that difference came from the creation of the sales tax. So we found two cases of sizable increases in revenue from tax hikes. Still, it doesn’t compete with the estimated $1 billion-plus from the transportation sales tax. Each economist and expert we spoke with noted a potential problem with Pennington’s claim: The tax may not collect $1 billion or more. The way the referendum works, the state is divided into 12 regions and it’s up to voters in each region to decide whether to approve the sales tax. There’s great debate about the referendum’s chances in the 10-county metro Atlanta region. The tax is projected to raise about $8 billion for transportation projects over the span of 10 years, which is at least one-half of the total statewide. Pennington conceded the tax "would be a whole lot smaller" than $1.6 billion a year if it doesn’t pass in metro Atlanta. The latest revenue projection from the tax for Pennington’s northwest Georgia region is $140 million a year. It is possible, if all 12 regions pass the tax, that it could collect more than $1 billion a year, which would be the largest tax increase that we could find. The key will be whether voters in the Atlanta region approve it. Since Pennington said it "could" be the largest tax increase, we believe he gets to drive through the safe lane on his claim. Our rating is True.	None	David Pennington	None	None	None	2011-08-22T06:00:00	2011-08-15	['None']
pomt-02584	"The federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan" gave his first address to a joint session of Congress.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-was-higher-during-r/	During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made a pitch for an increase in the minimum wage to $10.10. "Easy to remember," Obama said of the proposal. (Not quite as catchy as Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan, but close.) In trying to gain support from Republicans, Obama invoked their conservative idol. "Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here," Obama said of the former president. It’s a point Obama has tried to make before. We saw him use the comparison last year in a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill. As we noted then, if you compare the minimum wages between the two eras at face value, it’s not close. The minimum wage under all eight years of Reagan’s presidency was $3.35; today the federal minimum wage is $7.25, and has been since 2009. It’s pretty clear, then, that Obama is referring to the inflation-adjusted minimum wage rate. By that measure, the minimum wage was higher from 1981 to 1984, during Reagan's first term. How much higher? Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, we were able to figure that out. Year Minimum wage Wage in 2013 dollars Percent difference with current wage 1981 $3.35 $8.59 15.6% 1982 $3.35 $8.09 10.4% 1983 $3.35 $7.84 7.5% 1984 $3.35 $7.51 3.5% 1985 $3.35 $7.25 0.0% 1986 $3.35 $7.12 -1.8% 1987 $3.35 $6.87 -5.5% 1988 $3.35 $6.60 -9.8% 1989 $3.35 $6.29 -15.3% 2013 $7.25 $7.25 — In 1981, the minimum wage, adjusted to inflation was $8.61. Today’s mark of $7.25 is 15.6 percent less. That’s not quite 20 percent as Obama said, but it’s in the ballpark (exactly 20 percent less would put today’s minimum wage at $6.87). But if you take a look, you’ll see that adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage dropped every year of Reagan’s presidency. Today’s minimum wage is 15 percent more than what it was in 1989. As we pointed out in a previous fact check, Reagan was the only president never to oversee a boost in the minimum wage. So invoking the Gipper to push a minimum wage hike is a tough sell. We reached out to the White House. They sent us minimum wage figures adusted for inflation similar to what we calculated (about 18.8 percent higher in 1981, by their numbers). Our ruling Obama said, "the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan" gave his first State of the Union address. Obama's not far off, but it’s actually closer to 16 percent less. And using Reagan to make a case to raise the minimum wage should be taken with a grain of salt since the former president never increased it during his two terms. And by Reagan’s last State of the Union, the minimum wage was $2 less than when he first took office, if you factor in inflation. The statement is largely accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. UPDATE, Jan. 29, 2014: After we published this story, an alert reader noted that our original paraphrase of part of Obama's quote was inaccurate. We had written that Obama had said "the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan" gave his first State of the Union address. As the reader pointed out, a new president's first address to a joint session of Congress -- the 1981 speech that Obama was referring to -- is not officially called a State of the Union address. So we have rewritten our paraphrase in the ruling statement above to remove the reference to the State of the Union. It does not affect the rating of Mostly True.

pomt-07506	"Many states without collective bargaining, such as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina, have far larger budget deficits than many that do, including Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/11/david-pepper/david-pepper-says-budget-woes-states-without-publi/	Gov. John Kasich has said collective bargaining should be restricted for Ohio’s public workers to help governments balance their budgets and, in turn, help the state bring its spending into balance in the face of a massive deficit. "One of the reasons I did this is I wanted local governments to have the tools to be able to control their costs," Republican Kasich said in March right before he released his budget proposal that sharply cuts state funding to local governments. But opponents of controversial Senate Bill 5 — a measure that Kasich enthusiastically signed March 31 that would sharply restrict bargaining, end binding arbitration and ban public employees from striking — say the governor’s argument comes up false when comparing Ohio to other states. "There is no evidence to suggest that collective bargaining is the cause of overall budget challenges," former Hamilton County Commissioner David Pepper told an Ohio House committee in March. "Many states without collective bargaining, such as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina, have far larger budget deficits than many that do, including Ohio." Clearly, Pepper and the governor have very different ways of framing the debate over collective bargaining. The last part of his comment got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, though, and we decided to take a look. Pepper, a Democrat who lost to Republican Dave Yost last November in the state auditor election, said his point was that most states are suffering budget difficulties regardless of whether they have collective bargaining options for public workers. "There is clearly from looking across the country no correlation between states that have collective bargaining for public workers and having budget problems or being competitive," Pepper said in an interview. "There simply is no case for getting rid of collective bargaining to solve budget problems." Pepper said his comments were based on information from Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning research organization. Its executive director, Amy Hanauer, testified in February to a Senate committee that Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada all faced more significant budget gaps than Ohio for fiscal 2010. In terms of percentages of their overall budgets, the gaps were higher in Arizona (65 percent), North Carolina (26 percent) and Nevada (47 percent) than in Ohio (14 percent) for fiscal 2010, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also a left-leaning group. CBPP’s data is widely used by government think tank groups, including by the Pew Center on the States. Data from the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures showed the same was true in fiscal 2011 when those same three states had deficits that were a larger percentage of the overall budget than was the case in Ohio. In terms of dollars, Arizona’s deficit of $5.1 billion and North Carolina’s -- $5 billion -- were both higher than Ohio’s gap of $3.6 billion for 2010. But Nevada’s -- $1.5 billion -- was lower. Republicans who control the General Assembly argue that many local governments have complained about public employee wages and benefits, sometimes gained through binding arbitration when negotiations have failed. But likening restrictions on collective bargaining to a budget solving pill appears to be a stretch. States with no collective bargaining for public employees had an average budget gap of 24.8 percent in 2010, according to Policy Matters Ohio. Meanwhile, states with collective bargaining for all public employees had an average deficit gap of 24.1 percent. Pepper was right on the money in terms of percentage gaps. He was correct in terms of actual dollars and cents for two of the three states he cited. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Pepper’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-09203	"Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years. In fact, he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement."	true	/florida/statements/2010/may/24/kendrick-meek/meek-claims-greene-moved-florida-two-years-ago/	U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek says one of his Democratic opponents for U.S. Senate, billionaire real estate tycoon Jeff Greene, is such a newcomer to Florida that he wouldn't qualify to run for any other statewide office. Meek makes the claim about Greene's residency on a campaign website he created in May 2010 called LeaveittoGreene.com: "Jeff Greene only moved from California to Florida in the last two years. In fact, he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement." We were interested in both parts of Meek's claim, so the questions are: when did Greene move to Florida and would his tenure here be long enough to run for any other statewide office? First, some background on Greene. Greene, 55, grew up in Worcester, Mass. When his parents moved to West Palm Beach, he stayed with his aunt to finish high school in Worcester, according to a Miami Herald Dec. 7, 2009 profile. He went to Johns Hopkins for college and spent school breaks in South Florida. Greene later went to Harvard Business School and then moved to Los Angeles in 1980, Forbes reported. Here's how Greene addressed his South Florida ties on his campaign website: "For over 40 years, Florida has been a part of my life. When I was a teenager, my family moved to Florida after my father lost his livelihood in Massachusetts. During high school I worked alongside my dad on his vending machine routes throughout South Florida. During college I worked as a bus boy and a waiter in Palm Beach. My father passed away here in Florida when I was a young man, and my 83-year-old mother has lived in West Palm Beach for over 40 years. I was born in Massachusetts and have spent time on both coasts building my real estate business. Since meeting my wife four years ago, we decided to make our home in Palm Beach where we live today with our newborn son." The Miami-Dade property appraiser's website shows that Greene purchased a Miami Beach condo on Alton Road for $3.1 million in April 2008. The Palm Beach County property appraiser's website shows that Greene purchased a $24 million home at 1200 S. Ocean Boulevard Palm Beach in December 2009. For other official sources showing when Greene established residency in Florida, we turned to his driver's license. Greene got his Florida driver's license on March 20, 2008, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. At the same time, he registered to vote. Greene spokesman Paul Blank told us that Greene became a Florida resident when he moved to a boat docked at a Miami Beach marina in February 2008. So we can say Greene established Florida residency in early 2008. Now what are those election requirements? The Florida Division of Elections website is clear: United States Senator: a citizen of the U.S. for at least 9 years and resident of the state when elected. Governor and Lieutenant Governor: an elector and resident of the state for the preceding 7 years. Cabinet Members: an elector and resident of the state for the preceding 7 years. Justice of the Supreme Court: an elector and resident of the state upon taking office. With only about two years' residency, Greene falls short of qualifying to run for governor or state Cabinet positions. And, since Supreme Court justices are appointed by the governor, he couldn't run for that either. But the office of U.S. Senate requires only that the candidate be a resident of the state when elected, which is how Greene qualifies. Meek's claim was that Greene "moved from California to Florida in the last two years" and that "he would not legally be allowed to run for any other statewide office because he has not lived here long enough to meet the residency requirement." We find this claim True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-05-24T10:30:43	2010-05-21	['California']
pomt-11714	The 1986 tax reform approved under Ronald Reagan "was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-1986-tax-reform-current-one-had-l/	U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry that polls show most Americans don’t support supporting the historic tax reform he and other Republicans are pushing toward a final vote. At this stage prior to the last major tax reform, in 1986, the Wisconsin Republican says, support was low, too. Let’s see if Ryan -- suddenly in the spotlight over whether he might retire -- is right on his history. Ryan’s claim Ryan made his claim during a Dec. 13, 2017 interview with Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Ryan referred to the 1986 reform, signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan, during this exchange: Weber: Are you losing the messaging war, though, with these polls showing half of the country doesn’t like this plan? They clearly don’t understand it. Ryan: Yeah, I think that’s right. You know, we went back and took solace in this. Gosh, everybody looks at the Reagan tax reform as such a phenomenal success ….And guess what: The thing was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it. "Polling at about 18 percent" is a bit vague, but let’s see what the evidence shows. The polls As Weber indicated, December 2017 polls about the current tax reform show not only that support is low, but that opposition is high. Three examples: Only 25 percent approved of the way Republicans "are handling" tax reform and 63 percent disapproved (Marist); 26 percent approved "of the Republican tax plan" and 55 percent disapproved (Quinnipiac); and, among those who said they were aware of the tax plan, 31 percent said they supported it and 49 percent were opposed (Reuters/Ipsos). Let’s be clear on the timing in terms of weighing Ryan’s claim. On the same morning of Ryan’s interview, Republicans in Congress announced that House and Senate leaders had reached a deal on reconciling separate tax reform bills that had been approved in the House and the Senate. Details of the agreement had not been released. It was expected that the final bill would be ready for votes in the House and Senate the following week, with a goal of getting the bill to President Donald Trump before Christmas. It’s difficult to pinpoint when the 1986 tax reform effort was at the same stage as the current effort. But mid- to late-1986 would be roughly the time frame. According to a New York Times chronology, on July 17, 1986, "in a room overflowing with lobbyists from every conceivable commercial interest, 11 senators and 11 representatives (began) the conference to write the final version of the legislation." The final version was approved by the House and Senate in late-September 1986. Reagan signed the bill Oct. 22, 1986. Polling experts told us they were surprised, after looking back, how relatively little polling was done about support for the 1986 tax reform at this stage in the process. Ryan’s office cited to us one result from a September 1986 Gallup Poll: 18 percent said they thought their taxes would decrease under the plan. But that question isn’t on point in terms of support or approval. More importantly, that poll was taken after the House-Senate conference committee had approved the 1986 bill. That step hadn’t yet occurred when Ryan made his statement about the current reform. We found four polls taken before that stage. Two polls with results near Ryan’s 18 percent claim Poll Date Question Results ABC News/Washington Post Poll June 1986 From what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don't you know enough about it to say? Favor: 22% Oppose: 15% Don’t Know/No opinion: 63% ABC News/Washington Post Poll Sept. 1986 From what you have read or heard, do you favor or oppose this tax bill, or don’t you know enough about it to say? Favor: 22% Oppose: 15% Don’t know enough about it to say: 63% So, with identical results in both polls, the 22 percent Favor, which is seven points higher than Oppose, is close to Ryan’s 18 percent claim -- even though a strong majority didn’t choose either response. Two polls with higher support -- and opposition The other two polls, however, showed much higher support for the bill than Ryan indicated -- but also much higher opposition, as fewer respondents were on the fence: Gallup Poll June 1986 From what you’ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal? Approve: 38% Disapprove: 36% Don’t Know: 26% Gallup Poll Aug. 1986 From what you’ve heard or read about it, would you say approve or disapprove of the latest tax reform proposal? Approve: 40% Disapprove 34% Don’t Know: 26% The 38 percent and 40 percent approval rates in those two polls are much higher than Ryan’s 18 percent claim. Moreover, the disapproval rates show in polls on the current reform are much higher than those shown in the four 1986 polls. In that respect, the comparison Ryan draws is not entirely on point. Our rating Ryan said the 1986 tax reform approved under Reagan "was polling at about 18 percent right before they passed it." Two national polls, taken at roughly the stage of where the current tax reform effort is, showed 22 percent favored the legislation. That’s close to Ryan’s 18 percent claim. But two other polls showed approval of the bill at or near 40 percent, as more respondents were willing to choose Approve or Disapprove, rather than Don’t Know. Moreover, the disapproval rates in polls on the current tax reform are much higher than they were in the 1986 polls. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Ryan’s statement Half True.

pomt-00552	Says Bill Clinton "gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs" and said "we needed a regime change," even though everyone blamed those things on George W. Bush.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/16/facebook-posts/meme-says-bill-clinton-george-w-bush-had-basically/	As Hillary Clinton makes a second bid for the presidency, the record of her husband -- former President Bill Clinton -- is being revived on social media. Recently, a meme has been circulating that makes a little fun of the former president’s "teflon" nature -- failings didn‘t stick to him the way they stuck to other politicians. The meme features a photograph of Clinton with an impish grin and a twinkle in his eye, along with the following caption: "I gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs (weapons of mass destruction) and stuff. I said we needed a regime change for the security of our nation and to free the Iraqi people from an evil dictator. In 1998 I signed the Iraq Liberation Act. Ya’ll blamed it on Bush. Thanks for that!" The meme argues that Clinton essentially escaped the opprobrium that plagued his successor, President George W. Bush, even though they said similar things about Saddam Hussein-era Iraq and the geopolitical threat it posed. By extension, the meme suggests that Democratic supporters of Clinton are hypocritical by celebrating Clinton but excoriating Bush. We looked back at the speeches in question and found that the meme’s pairing of Clinton’s views with Bush’s is misleading on several fronts. Clinton ‘gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs’ Clinton did indeed give a weekly radio address on Sept. 7, 1996, in which he said, "We must redouble our efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, such as those that Iraq and other rogue nations have developed." However, it’s important to note that Clinton focused on chemical weapons and did not bring up nuclear weapons, as Bush would later do. "The Senate will vote on ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention," Clinton said. "By voting for this treaty, the Senate can help to banish poison gas from the earth, and make America's citizens and soldiers much more secure. … The treaty will increase the safety of our citizens at home, as well as our troops in the field. The destruction of current stockpiles, including at least 40,000 tons of poison gas in Russia alone, will put the largest potential sources of chemical weapons out of the reach of terrorists, and the trade controls will deny terrorists easy access to the ingredients they seek." Bush, by contrast, would later make much more sweeping claims. For instance, in a weekly radio address on Sept. 14, 2002, Bush said of Hussein-era Iraq, "Today this regime likely maintains stockpiles of chemical and biological agents, and is improving and expanding facilities capable of producing chemical and biological weapons. Today Saddam Hussein has the scientists and infrastructure for a nuclear weapons program, and has illicitly sought to purchase the equipment needed to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Should his regime acquire fissile material, it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year." Then, during his State of the Union address on Jan. 28, 2003 -- on the eve of the war -- Bush said, "The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production." So while it’s true that both Clinton and Bush mentioned weapons of mass destruction in relation to Iraq, Bush’s claim was much more expansive. Clinton ‘said we needed a regime change’ Clinton was hardly friendly toward Hussein, but he did not take actions to use military might to oust the Iraqi leader from power. For instance, on Sept. 3, 1996, Clinton gave a speech responding to attacks by Iraqi forces on the Kurdish-controlled city of Irbil in northern Iraq. "Hussein's objectives may change, but his methods are always the same: violence and aggression -- against the Kurds, against other ethnic minorities, against Iraq's neighbors," Clinton said. "Our answer to that recklessness must be strong and immediate, as President Bush demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm, as we showed two years ago when Iraq amassed its forces on Kuwait's border. … We must make it clear that reckless acts have consequences, or those acts will increase. We must reduce Iraq's ability to strike out at its neighbors, and we must increase America's ability to contain Iraq over the long run." This approach was about containing Hussein, not about ousting him. Containment was also the mission of the years-long no-fly zones over Iraq that were enforced by George H.W. Bush, Clinton and, before the war began, George W. Bush. The meme cites the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act. Clinton did sign that law, which passed with just 38 dissenters in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate. The law said it "should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime." However, the methods of regime change mentioned in the law are U.S. support for home-grown anti-Hussein movements, including humanitarian aid, broadcasting assistance and military goods and training. The recipients of such aid would need to include "a broad spectrum of Iraqi individuals, groups, or both, opposed to the Saddam Hussein regime" and be "committed to democratic values, to respect for human rights, to peaceful relations with Iraq's neighbors, to maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity, and to fostering cooperation among democratic opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime." That’s a big difference from Bush’s decision to use military force to attack and enter Iraq and topple Hussein by force. "There's a difference between what Clinton did and said and George W. Bush's decision to overtly invade and topple the Hussein regime with force," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "We'll never know if Clinton would have done that. We know, however, that Bush did, and he and his supporters have to live with that alone. They don't get to cravenly try to share responsibility with a man who was long out of office when we invaded." Our ruling The meme says Clinton "gave a speech in 1996 about Iraq having WMDs" and "said we needed a regime change," even though everyone blamed those things on George W. Bush. Clinton did cite weapons of mass destruction in a speech about Iraq that year, but it was much more limited -- it focused on Hussein’s holdings of chemical weapons, not the alleged nuclear or biological stockpiles that Bush later used as a justification for the Iraq War. Meanwhile, Clinton did sign a law backing regime change in Iraq, but it was limited to assistance to homegrown opposition groups, not to a ground war aimed at toppling Hussein, as Bush later pursued. The meme contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02274	"In order to pass the CRCT in Georgia, you simply have to get half of the answers correct."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/08/alisha-thomas-morgan/lawmaker-seeks-passing-grade-crct-claim/	A state lawmaker surprised us recently when she talked about what she said is the low threshold for Georgia students to pass an important exam. "In order to pass the CRCT in Georgia, you simply have to get half of the answers correct," said state Rep. Alisha Thomas Morgan, a Democrat from Cobb County. Surely, Georgia students have to do better than that? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some homework on the representative’s claim. Morgan is running for state schools superintendent and was speaking against legislation that would create a study committee to look into the hotly debated Common Core policy and the federal government’s "increasingly greater role in public education." The legislation, House Resolution 550, passed along party lines in the Republican-led state House by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. Morgan voted against the legislation. The CRCT stands for the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test. State law requires Georgia public school students in grades 3 through 8 to take the CRCT in reading, English/language arts, math, science and social studies. Students in grades 3, 5 and 8 must meet or exceed state standards in reading to be promoted to the next grade. Fifth- and eighth-graders must also meet or exceed state standards in math to be promoted. In 2013, most Georgia students met or exceeded standards, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. When Morgan made her remarks during the debate on HR 550, she was referring to the "cut scores" to meet state standards, said Michael Brewer, her deputy campaign manager. Cut scores vary from subject area and grade level. Georgia has two sets of cut scores: one for students who meet state standards and another for students who exceed the standards. In order to meet state standards, students have to get only about one-half of the answers correct in a content area. Georgia students must get at least 75 percent to 80 percent of the answers correct in order to exceed state standards. Matt Cardoza, a spokesman for state Schools Superintendent John Barge, told us the state wants to see higher scores, which may happen as soon as the 2014-15 school year. "Our standards are definitely too low, and it needs to be higher," Cardoza said. Brewer sent us an article with the scores for the 2011-12 school year. The numbers show the cut scores were 50 percent or less in 16 of the 30 subjects for the six grade levels, also known as content areas. The highest pass rate was for third-grade math, at 57 percent. The Georgia Department of Education sent us cut scores for 2012 and 2013. The 2012 cut scores were slightly different than what was in the article Brewer sent us, but they support Morgan’s claim. The cut scores were 50 percent or less in 17 of the 30 content areas. The highest cut score was for fourth-grade math, at 58 percent. In 2013, the cut scores were 50 percent or less in 18 of the 30 content areas. The highest cut score was for third- and fourth-grade math, at 57 percent. Scott Marion, associate director of the Center for Assessment, a New Hampshire-based nonprofit that works with schools to improve student achievement, said Morgan’s claim "is probably right," but it requires deeper understanding. Marion said the CRCT’s cut scores do not offer a true understanding of how well students understand course material. "If everybody gets (the answers right), it’s giving me no information to understand the range of performance in a state," said Marion, who has worked with educators in Georgia. Marion used the example of Advanced Placement exams, which are widely recognized as meaningful indicators of student proficiency. He noted that to score a 3 on most of the AP exams — the minimum score on a scale of 5 that is acceptable for college credit — generally requires getting about 50 percent to 60 percent of the multiple-choice questions correct. AP tests also include essay questions. "This is a good score on a challenging test," Marion said. "But it is certainly not comparable to the traditional percent correct metric used for classroom assessment." Our conclusion Morgan said "in order to pass the CRCT in Georgia, you simply have to get half of the answers correct." In slightly more than half of the subjects for grades 3 through 8, she’s correct. The "cut scores" to meet state standards are a little higher in other areas, but not much higher. We believe Morgan’s statement is largely on target but slightly missed some context. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	Alisha Thomas Morgan	None	None	None	2014-04-08T06:00:00	2014-03-20	['None']
pomt-05228	Says PolitiFact issued a True ruling on Paul Krugman calling "Governor Christie a ‘fiscal phony.’"	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/06/new-jersey-democratic-state-committee/new-jersey-democrats-claims-politifact-said-it-was/	As Democrats proved recently, use PolitiFact New Jersey as a weapon to slam Gov. Chris Christie and you could be the one getting bruised. In the June 1 "Week In Review" on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee suggested that we issued a True ruling on the claim by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman that the Republican governor is a "fiscal phony." Under the headline "New York Times Calls Christie a Fiscal Phony," the post read as follows: "Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a ‘fiscal phony’ this week for Christie’s willingness to borrow money in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest New Jersey residents. Politifact found the Krugman’s claims about Christie to be TRUE." But our True ruling was based on Krugman’s claim about how the state’s job growth during Christie’s tenure has been less than the gains in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. We did not rule on Krugman's "fiscal phony" statement, and our fact-check never addressed Christie's plans to borrow money and cut taxes. Alicia D'Alessandro, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, acknowledged the Democrats’ mistake in a statement. The website post was later changed to accurately reflect our fact-check. "We did not mean to imply that Politifact was calling Christie a fiscal phony, although we wish you had done so, because he is," D'Alessandro wrote. "We do recognize that our language should have been more precise and that the sentence in question should have read: 'Politifact found Krugman's claims about anemic job growth under Christie to be TRUE.’" Let’s review what our story was really about. In his May 28 column, Krugman said Christie "proved himself just another standard fiscal phony." The liberal columnist criticized the governor’s "Jersey Comeback" message in light of the job growth since Christie took office in January 2010. "Here’s the story: For some time now Mr. Christie has been touting what he calls the ‘Jersey comeback,’" Krugman wrote. "Even before his latest outburst, it was hard to see what he was talking about: yes, there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison." As we explained in our May 31 ruling, Krugman’s analysis was correct. In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the time of Krugman's statement, the April figures were preliminary. But we never said Krugman’s critique of Christie as a "fiscal phony" was accurate. Our ruling In the June 1 "Week In Review" on its website, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee claimed "Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, called Governor Christie a ‘fiscal phony’" and "Politifact found the Krugman’s claims about Christie to be TRUE." But our True ruling was based on Krugman’s claim that New Jersey’s job growth since Christie took office has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole. "Fiscal phony" is a catchy phrase, but it had nothing to do with our ruling. We rate the Democrats’ claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05399	"Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/04/barack-obama/barack-obamas-life-julia-tool-says-mitt-romney-wou/	The Obama campaign has created Julia, a character on its website, to show the contrasts between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. "The Life of Julia" is a Web cartoon that claims Julia would have a richer and more rewarding life under Obama than under Romney. The cartoon compares the candidates' impact on Julia at a dozen points in her life. For this item, we're checking the claim about Julia at age 25. "Under President Obama: After graduation, Julia's federal student loans are more manageable since President Obama capped income-based federal student loan payments and kept interest rates low. She makes her payments on time every month, keeping her on track to repay her student loans." "Under Mitt Romney: Under the Romney/Ryan budget, interest rates on federal student loans would be allowed to double, affecting Julia and 7.4 million other students." That surprised us because we recalled Romney and House Republican leaders saying recently that they did not want the rates to double. So we looked into the claim. What’s at stake First, some background on the student loan issue. As PolitiFact Ohio noted recently, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (H.R. 2669) was passed by Congress in 2007. The law gradually reduced the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent in July 2006 to 3.4 percent in July 2011. Advanced by a newly Democratic-majority Congress, the law had bipartisan support. Democrats were joined by 77 House Republicans and 35 Senate Republicans. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush. The law expires in July and if no action is taken, the interest rate will return to 6.8 percent. That would affect more than 7 million borrowers, and add $1,000 a year to the repayment cost of the average loan, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. Obama's budget proposal for fiscal 2013 included money to extend the lower rate, though only for one year. Romney, Ryan and House Republican leaders would also keep it at 3.4 percent, although they want to pay for it by repealing a portion of the Democratic health care law. Romney’s position on the loan issue During a campaign of sharp disagreements, the student loan rate is a rare example of unity between Obama and Romney. At an April 23, 2012, campaign appearance near Philadelphia, Romney said, "I support extending the temporary relief on interest rates for students" given the "extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market." The Associated Press reported that Romney did not offer specifics on how the extension should be paid for or how long it should last, and as we will explain below, resolving these differences will not be easy. Still, the comments indicate that Julia's rates wouldn't rise under Romney as the cartoon suggests. Romney’s position on the Ryan budget But note that Obama campaign attempts to link Romney to the budget produced by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Democrats have made the Ryan budget a centerpiece of their attacks since it would likely lead to deep cuts in federal spending, including reductions in popular programs. The Obama campaign pointed us to two pieces of evidence to link Romney to Ryan’s budget. First, Romney said at a March campaign event in Chicago, "I'm very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. It's a bold and exciting effort on his part and on the part of the Republicans, and it's very much consistent with what I put out earlier. ... I applaud it. It's an excellent piece of work and very much needed." Second, the Obama campaign quotes Ryan saying on the March 25, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation that he expects Romney to implement his budget proposal if he wins the presidency. When CBS’ Norah O’Donnell asked Ryan, "If Mitt Romney became president of the United States, you`re convinced he would follow through with a lot of the reductions that you make in this plan?" Ryan twice said "yes." But these statements are hardly a slam-dunk that Romney has embraced the entire Ryan budget -- nor that it will be enacted. While Romney praised the proposal, he stopped short of promising to enact it. Then there’s the question of what the Ryan budget would actually do regarding student loans. What Ryan would do The Ryan budget is a blueprint, with significant discretion left for future congressional actions on the specifics about revenues and spending. Nowhere in the budget does it say, "Allow the rates on student loans to double." The budget could result in a doubling of rates (or perhaps a smaller increase) if that’s what Congress chooses to do in the future. However, Congress could choose to protect the lower interest rates and cut elsewhere instead. "Democrats are claiming that the House-passed budget doubled the rate because it did not directly address the question of how to extend it," said Conor Sweeney, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee, which Ryan chairs. "This is not how a budget works. The budget sets overall targets and gives committees of jurisdiction broad latitude in meeting those targets." As it happens, the brouhaha on the campaign trail over student loans prompted Republican leaders on April 27 to vote on a bill to stop the rate from doubling. The bill would continue the 3.4 percent rate and pay for it by repealing a provision of Obama’s health care law known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The bill passed by a 215-195 vote. The coalition in support was predominantly but not exclusively Republican; 13 Democrats voted for the GOP leadership-backed bill while 30 Republicans defected and voted against it. So both parties want to keep the rate the same. The sticking point is how to pay for it. Many Democrats, including the White House, are strongly opposed to repealing the health fund, which supports immunization, research, screenings and wellness education. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has labeled the money a "slush fund," a characterization Republicans have long used for the program. PolitiFact rated the term as a Pants on Fire falsehood a year ago. Sweeney, the Ryan spokesman, said the bill that passed the House "is fully compatible with our budget’s targets." And Ryan himself voted for it. The parties are so polarized that it's not clear how they might compromise on the issue. Still, a majority of the House, including a large majority of Republicans, did go on record to support a bill that would keep the interest rate from doubling. Our ruling The Obama campaign claims that loan rates would double on Julia under Romney and the Ryan budget. But the evidence suggests otherwise. Romney opposes allowing the rates to double, and House Republicans -- including Ryan -- have voted to stop it from happening. Their approach to pay for the extension may not suit the White House, but it's inaccurate to say the rates would double. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06873	(Rep. Bob Goodlatte's) balanced budget amendment does not require a balanced budget.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/01/bobby-scott/scott-says-balanced-budget-amendment-does-not-requ/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott recently urged House colleagues not to be fooled by the title of a proposed "balanced budget" amendment. "No provision of the amendment requires a balanced budget," Scott, D-3rd, said in a July 14 letter he sent to fellow lawmakers. "All debate on this bill has been on the title and not the provisions in it." A balanced budget amendment with no stipulation to balance the budget? Scott has made this claim repeatedly, so we decided to check it out. First, we should point out a number of proposals for balanced budget amendments are in the pipelines. Scott directed his statement at a resolution sponsored by a fellow Virginian - U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th. Goodlatte’s measure was approved by the House Judiciary Committee -- on which Scott serves -- on June 15. It calls for the president to propose a balanced budget each fiscal year. But there are two exceptions that Scott says give the resolution more holes than the Titanic. Scott points to language in the legislation that says, "Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote." "It doesn’t say you need to pass a balanced budget," Scott told us over the telephone. "It doesn’t require it. It just says you need three-fifths vote to pass a budget that’s not balanced." The Democrat also noted that the amendment would allow Congress, by simple majority votes, to waive the balanced budget requirement if the U.S. is involved in a conflict "that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security." Scott, during a June hearing, suggested that Congress could exaggerate national security risks and use them as an escape valve against balancing the budget. So would Goodlatte’s amendment require a balanced budget? For an answer to this semantic question, we first turned to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed the bills in a June 21 letter to Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In summarizing the bill’s provision calling for the passage of a balanced budget, the CBO said "such a requirement could be overridden by a three-fifths vote in each House (in Congress)." In other words, the resolution does require a balanced budget but allows that stipulation to be waived. Next, we turned to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that, along with Scott, opposes Goodlatte’s resolution. Robert Greenstein, the center’s president, said in a July 16 statement that Goodlatte’s amendment was one of several pending before Congress that "would essentially require that the budget be balanced within the coming decade." A June 1 letter to the House Judiciary committee, signed by 123 groups opposing Goodlatte’s legislation, said the measure "would require a balanced budget every year, regardless of the state of the economy." We also talked to Bob Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that has long spoken out against federal deficits. He said balanced budget amendments typically have an "escape clause" to allow extra spending. He said the three-fifths vote required for additional spending under Goodlatte’s bill is a high threshold. "The intent of Goodlatte’s legislation is clearly to establish a balanced budget," Bixby said. "You could say in a very technical sense (a balanced budget) is not required if Congress has an escape clause, but of course that’s par for the course in a constitutional amendment." Goodlatte’s measure would also set an annual federal spending limit at 18 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product and would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to exceed that threshold. In addition, it would require a three-fifths vote in both houses to raise the debt ceiling. Constitutional amendments are extremely difficult to pass. First they require a two-thirds vote in each House of Congress. Then three-quarters of the 50 state legislatures have to approve the amendment before it could become part of the Constitution. Let’s review: Scott said that no provision in Goodlatte’s balanced budget amendment would require balancing the budget. He makes a narrow argument based on escape valves built into the resolution. But a number of policy experts say the resolution does, first and foremost, require a balanced budget and imposes high thresholds for its exceptions. We agree and find Scott’s semantic debate misleading. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-01T06:00:00	2011-07-14	['None']
pomt-02771	"The CBO just said if we cut this (unemployment benefits) extension, we will kill jobs, because those people who are looking for work won't have any money to spend."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/10/david-madland/david-madland-cbo-says-jobless-aid-will-boost-econ/	As the days tick down on this session of Congress, one of lawmakers’ final acts will be to extend or end unemployment benefits for about 1.3 million people. Without an extension through 2014, checks for the long-term unemployed would stop at the end of the month. The matter is intertwined with the budget deal that Republicans and Democrats are negotiating behind closed doors. The extension’s price tag is $26 billion. Democrats support it, but Republicans do not want to see the expense added to the national debt. Conservatives also argue that providing the additional money will simply encourage some people to turn down jobs they would otherwise accept. The longer they stay out of work, conservatives say, the less desirable they become in the eyes of a potential employer and the lower their earnings. Ultimately, the economy suffers. David Madland with the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning group that favors progressive government policies, rebutted that assertion with an opposite economic argument. "The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) just said if we cut this extension, we will kill jobs, because those people who are looking for work won't have any money to spend," Madland said on CNN’s Crossfire. Madland told PunditFact he was referring to a report the Congressional Budget Office issued Dec. 3. We looked at that report. The budget office, the ultimate nonpartisan authority on money matters facing Congress, determined extending those additional unemployment checks would boost the economy by two-tenths of a percent next year and add about 200,000 jobs. That makes Madland's broader point -- that extending unemployment benefits actually boosts job creation -- correct. But he erred is suggesting the CBO determined that failing to extend unemployment benefits would "kill" jobs. The CBO did not analyze that. The report also came with a cautionary note. It said that if the government borrows more to pay for the extension then the move would "eventually reduce the nation’s output and income slightly below what would occur under current law." Steven Elliott, an economist at Miami University in Ohio, said the Congressional Budget Office is applying basic economic theory. "The extended unemployment benefits will increase consumption because unemployed individuals who would otherwise not have income will be buying things," Elliott said. "That in turn will mean that more products will need to be produced and then there are multiplier effects from there." On the other end however, the meter runs in reverse. If Washington borrows the money, Congress will need to raise taxes to pay it back. That takes money away from households, and as a result, they buy less and the economy loses steam. Madland said that could happen but "it is pretty hard to predict what fiscal policy or debt levels will be like in the long run." Elliott agreed that the losses down the line might be avoidable. The hope, he said, is that a temporary hike in household spending becomes permanent. This leads to more jobs and more people paying taxes to pay back the borrowed funds. But there’s no guarantee that will happen. "That’s the risk." Elliott said. Our ruling Madland said the Congressional Budget Office found that a failure to extend unemployment benefits would kill jobs. Madland's language is close, but goes a step too far. The CBO said that extending unemployment benefits would spur growth and add about 200,000 jobs. The CBO did not conclude that failing to do so would result in the loss of jobs. As such, we rate this claim Half True.	None	David Madland	None	None	None	2013-12-10T14:24:27	2013-12-06	['None']
pomt-13713	"Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/barack-obama/mostly-true-obama-says-world-opinion-us-better-now/	President Barack Obama invoked his characteristic themes of hope and unity at the Democratic National Convention, countering what he called Donald Trump’s "pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other." Whereas Obama touted Hillary Clinton as having earned the respect of leaders around the world and experts at home, he rebuked Trump’s isolationism and more unconventional foreign policy positions and proposals. "He cozies up to Putin, praises Saddam Hussein, and tells the NATO allies that stood by our side after 9/11 that they have to pay up if they want our protection," Obama said. "Well, America’s promises do not come with a price tag. We meet our commitments. That’s one of the reasons why almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office." Does the world really like us more now than they did eight years ago? The White House referred us to our own archives and a fact-check of former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. Carlson claimed that most polls show the world has "lower regard" for the United States now under Obama than under President George W. Bush. We rated that claim False. So what about Obama's claim? The president is putting words into pollsters’ mouths when he specifically says strength and respect, but he’s generally right that world opinion of the United States has improved. Here’s a breakdown of how the United States stacked up over the course of Obama’s presidency, according to various polls. Positive opinions are expressed with a plus sign, and negative ones with a minus. The number outside of the parentheses indicates the net favorability. 2008 2014/2015 Change Gallup 0 (+34/-34) +15 (+45/-20) +15 Pew -5 (+43/-48) +45 (+69/-24) +50 BBC World Service/Globescan -8 (+35/-47) +4 (+42/-38) +12 We’ll go through the available data one by one Gallup Polling data from Gallup supports Obama’s claim. In its 2015 survey of more than 130 countries, 45 percent approved of the job performance of the leadership of the United States, while 28 percent disapproved. That’s up 11 percent in favorability while down 6 percent unfavorability from 2008. Here’s a snapshot: Pew Research Center In Pew’s June 2008 survey of 23 countries, 43 percent of respondents had a favorable view of the United States while 48 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view on average. In 2015 survey of 39 countries, the United States’ favorability jumped up to 69 percent while unfavorability dropped down to 24 percent. Out of the 21 countries included in both surveys, 18 had a more positive view of the United States in 2015 than they did in 2007. Russia, Lebanon and Jordan on the other hand had a more negative view. BBC World Service/Globescan Views toward the United States improved the least out of the three sets of polling, but they did improve. In 2008, an average of 35 percent of people surveyed in 34 countries said the United States is "having a positive influence" while 47 percent said it had a negative influence. Six years later, the global average jumped up to 42 percent positive and 38 percent negative. (Seven out of 10 people in 18 countries also told the BBC that Obama’s election was a good choice in a 2016 poll. Just three out of 10 people said that about President George W. Bush in 2005.) Our ruling Obama said, "Almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did eight years ago when I took office." The general sentiment that the United States is viewed more positively around the world is supported by three different sets of polls, but they don’t specifically talk about strength or respect.

pomt-01957	Says the secret John Doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been "resolved" and two judges have said it is "over."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/20/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-probe-his-campaign-finances-reso/	A secret criminal investigation made national news with the disclosure that prosecutors had alleged Gov. Scott Walker was at the center of an effort to illegally coordinate fundraising among conservative groups to help his campaign and others. But the next day, the Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate said the John Doe probe had been resolved and that two judges had said it was "over." Here is part of the June 20, 2014 interview of Walker by Steve Doocy, host of the network TV talk show "Fox & Friends": Doocy: "So, over the last couple of years, there’s been some legal action out in Wisconsin. And some of the documents were unsealed yesterday. We’ve got to point out, you were never charged with anything. But at one point, they allege that you had a central role in a criminal fund-raising scheme. OK, tell us what you did." Walker: "Well, don’t just take my word for it. Look at the facts. The facts are pretty clear. "You’ve had not one but two judges -- a state judge and a federal judge; a state judge (who is) a well-respected court of appeals judge, and a federal judge more recently -- have both looked at this argument. And in the past, not just recently -- remember this is not new news, it’s just newly released yesterday because documents were opened -- but no charges, case over. "Both judges said they didn’t buy the argument. They didn’t think that anything was done that was illegal, and so they’ve gone forward and not only said, we don’t buy it, they actually shut the case down, both at the state and at the federal level. "So, many in the national media and even some here in Wisconsin are looking at this (case) backwards. This is a case that’s been resolved, that not one but two judges have said is over. And we’re just learning about it because it became open in a document yesterday. But there is no argument there." Is that it? Is Walker right that the Doe case has been "resolved" and two judges have said it is "over"? Experts say no. After all, one of the key court rulings that has stalled the investigation is a "preliminary injunction." And that is on appeal. What’s the case about? Under Wisconsin law, a John Doe is "intended as an independent, investigatory tool to ascertain whether a crime has been committed and, if so, by whom." Unlike standard criminal investigations, law enforcement officials in a John Doe have special powers, including the power to compel the testimony of reluctant witnesses under oath and to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to turn over documents. Another key difference is that the judge overseeing a Doe can -- and typically does -- order that the proceedings be done in secret, unlike the vast majority of court proceedings. Walker has been connected to two John Doe investigations. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat, conducted a wide-ranging probe of aides and associates to Walker going back to Walker's time as Milwaukee County executive. That investigation, sometimes known as John Doe I, led to six convictions, ranging from misconduct in office for campaigning on county time to stealing from a veterans fund. Walker was not charged, and that investigation was shut down in March 2013. Before closing that probe, however, Chisholm launched a separate investigation in the summer of 2012 based on information learned in the first one. To get what has been termed John Doe II off the ground, Chisholm worked with district attorneys from four counties -- members of both parties -- and the state Government Accountability Board, which administers the state's elections and ethics laws. Francis Schmitz, a former assistant U.S. attorney and self-described Republican, was named special prosecutor in the case. Walker’s evidence Alleigh Marre, spokeswoman for Walker’s campaign, cited two court documents to back Walker’s claim. It’s not clear what she was referring to in the first document, a December 2013 court filing by Schmitz, and she didn’t respond to our request to elaborate. The second document was a court order that John Doe Judge Gregory Peterson issued on Jan. 10, 2014. It quashed subpoenas that had been issued to Walker’s campaign and several conservative groups. And it ordered the return of any property seized with those subpoenas or with search warrants served on two officials of the groups. But the order did not resolve the case. Indeed, in his order, Peterson made reference to the possibility of his ruling be appealed. And the order has been challenged and is awaiting a ruling from the state Court of Appeals. Other legal action Another key ruling was made in federal court, by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Randa. In February 2014, the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth and one of its directors, Eric O'Keefe sued in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee in an attempt to stop the Doe investigation, saying it violated their rights to free speech, free association and equal protection under the law. Three months later, Randa issued a preliminary injunction halting the probe while he considered the lawsuit. He said it appeared prosecutors were violating the First Amendment rights of Club for Growth and O'Keefe. And he ordered prosecutors to return any material they had gathered in the investigation and destroy whatever copies of it they had made. But as the term "preliminary injunction" would indicate, that did not mean the case had been resolved or was over. Indeed, Randa’s ruling has been appealed and the parties are awaiting a decision from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Experts weigh in We consulted five attorneys who have represented multiple clients in criminal John Doe investigations -- Madison defense attorneys Marcus Berghahn and Stephen Morgan (Morgan is a former state and federal prosecutor); Milwaukee defense attorneys Jeremy Levinson, who also handles campaign finance cases for Democrats, and Raymond Dall’Osto; and Marquette University Law School professor and former state prosecutor Daniel Blinka. Bottom line: The John Doe investigation case has been stopped for the time being, but it has not been resolved. The rulings by judges Peterson and Randa are not final and are being appealed. The appellate rulings could also be appealed. And if the Chicago appeals panel overrules Randa, the investigation can resume. "Once the Court of Appeals decides the merits of the case and if no party appeals the Court of Appeals’ decision, then it may be possible to say that the cases are over -- unless the case is returned to the trial court or John Doe Judge for further litigation," said Berghahn. Said Blinka: "The governor's remark overlooks the role of the appellate courts. The final resolution is up to the appellate courts, and only when the appellate process has run its course will we have a final resolution." It’s notable that at times during his governorship, Walker has been in the position of supporting appeals when a lower-court ruling has gone against him. In 2012, when judges struck down parts of Walker’s Act 10 -- the law ending most collective bargaining for most public employees -- the state appealed, and higher courts so far have upheld the law. And on same-sex marriage, which Walker opposes, he didn’t concede that a ban on gay marriages was dead when a federal judge found Wisconsin’s ban unconstitutional. Indeed, he’s backing the state’s appeal of the judge’s ruling. Similarly, the status of the Doe case is being hammered out in the appeals process. Our rating Walker said the secret John Doe criminal investigation of his campaign has been "resolved" and two judges have said it is "over." His characterization is misleading at best. The investigation has been stopped, for now, under one judge’s ruling.

pomt-04619	Says he "will protect your guaranteed benefits" in Medicare while "Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-right-guaranteed-benefits-under-medic/	A new ad from President Barack Obama emphasizes a favorite Democratic talking point -- that Medicare currently has "guaranteed benefits" that could be taken away if Mitt Romney wins the presidency. In the ad, a narrator says, "The new AARP Voter Guide is out with facts you need on Medicare. Fact: Barack Obama will protect your guaranteed benefits and will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program. Fact: Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits and instead give future retirees ‘premium support’ or vouchers. AARP opposes that plan and non-partisan analysts say it could raise seniors' costs up to $6,400 a year." But are there "guaranteed benefits" for Medicare today? And if so, would they be at risk if Romney wins? A lot of it depends on how you define these words. What guarantees exist under Medicare today? Probably the clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That wasn’t always the case. Before Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, health coverage for seniors was far from guaranteed. When people retired, they often lost coverage they had from their former employer and couldn’t afford a new plan. (For more on the pre-Medicare era, including statistics, see our article, "Were the early 1960s a golden age for health care?") The Obama campaign goes further. It argues that "guaranteed benefits" refers to "all the benefits that Medicare is required to cover." Today, Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting one’s benefits depend on the amount of money they paid into the system. "As a system of defined benefits, Medicare does guarantee those benefits," said Paul Starr, a specialist on health care reform at Princeton University. "The government has a responsibility for them that it would not have in a defined-contribution scheme. There are a host of legal rights in regard to providers that are also associated with those guaranteed benefits. All that goes away with the shift to defined contribution." Is there a complete guarantee of benefits? No, Medicare benefits aren’t guaranteed in every sense. First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans -- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments. And just because something is covered today doesn’t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost. Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it. Obama’s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn’t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn’t wrong that changesare going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program. Obama’s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has "guaranteed benefits." "If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. "I think a reasonable person could say yes." Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare "guarantee" is the program’s fiscal challenges. According to Medicare’s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law’s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program’s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years. "If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out," said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. "So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 … but then he loses it." Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama’s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare "guarantee" may be too strongly worded. "So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits," said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, "nothing in the statutes is ‘guaranteed,’ because Congress always has the option of changing the law." Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. "Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk," he said. How Romney would change Medicare As for Romney’s plan, it’s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn’t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we’ll explain it as best we can. Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors’ health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.) Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved. However, since CBO hasn’t weighed in, we don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term. The Obama campaign argues that "Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is ‘comparable’ to Medicare today" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits. But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that’s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services "establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal." Under the most recent plan, Levin said, "seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now." Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. "The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution," he said. "The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit." The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare’s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there’s still some uncertainty on this front. Under the Romney plan, MIT’s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. "As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble," he said. Our ruling In the ad, Obama said he "will protect your guaranteed benefits" in Medicare, while "Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits." Obama exaggerates when he refers to "guaranteed" Medicare benefits under today’s system. Currently, Medicare does "guarantee" a form of health coverage for seniors and, in the shorter term, guarantees specific benefits. But Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and Congress and the president can change what is covered, and will be forced to do so when fiscal pressures hit. Meanwhile, it’s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a "guarantee" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney’s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09076	"Ninety-six percent of the last session, (U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar) voted with Nancy Pelosi."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/26/bryan-underwood/underwood-says-cuellar-has-voted-pelosi-96-percent/	If the National Republican Congressional Committee is any guide, Republicans seeking to unseat Democrats in the U.S. House see promise in linking them to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who has shepherded much of the Obama administration’s legislation through the House. The committee didn’t feature Texas U.S. Rep Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, among 10 Pelosi "puppets" displayed on its website. But Bryan Underwood, the Republican running against Cuellar, recently called him a "Pelosi pawn." "Ninety-six percent of last session, he voted with Nancy Pelosi," Underwood said June 12 at the Republican Party of Texas convention. When we followed up with Underwood’s campaign, consultant John Pritchett pointed us to an online Washington Post database of lawmakers’ voting histories showing that Cuellar voted with Democrats 96 percent of the time in 2009-10. "She’s the leader of the party, she’s the speaker of the party, she is the party," Pritchett said. Fair enough? Well, we asked Pritchett about Underwood’s reference to "last session" in his convention remark. In the parlance of Washington, that would ordinarily mean the session before the current one, which began Jan. 5, 2010. However, Pritchett said that Underwood meant the entire period the current House membership — the 111th Congress — has been voting, from January 2009 through this month. Setting aside for a moment Cuellar’s votes in step with his party, we wondered how he’s personally aligned with Pelosi. A caveat: Any check of the vote-for-vote ratio between Cuellar and the speaker wouldn’t reflect Cuellar’s full voting history. That’s because Pelosi doesn’t vote that often. The House Speaker’s primary role is to preside over the 435-member House, generally voting only when it would make a difference in the legislation’s outcome. Sean Theriault, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, put it like this: "If not voting makes them look like they have the entire House’s interest at heart, all the better." From early 2009 through May 28, 2010, Pelosi voted 71 times, while Cuellar voted 1,323 times, according to the database. And according to the database, Pelosi and Cuellar both voted 48 times from Jan. 6, 2009 to Dec. 24, 2009 with Cuellar voting with Republicans five times and lining up with Pelosi 43 times, compiling an 89.5-percent I’m-with-her rate. Six months into the 2010 session, Pelosi has voted 23 times, according to the database, with Cuellar voting like her all 23 times. Republicans voted with them thrice. When did Cuellar stray from Pelosi’s side in 2009? He voted for Rep. Bart Stupak’s amendment that put restrictions on abortions available in government-run health care plans. He voted for Rep. Walt Minnick’s amendment that would have scrapped certain consumer protections proposed in financial overhaul legislation. He voted for a bill to disapprove the obligation to purchase troubled assets under the stimulus act. And he voted against two appropriation bills; Cuellar is the only Texan in the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally-conservative Democrats. Colin Strother, a spokesman for Cuellar’s campaign, pointed out that the 96 percent that Underwood cites includes a raft of votes for minor items, such as a vote to congratulate the New Orleans Saints for winning the Super Bowl. Finally, we sought other measures of Cuellar’s vote history. One measure is how many times he’s voted in step with President Barack Obama when he’s clearly indicated his preferences — 92 percent of his votes deferred to Obama last session, according to Congressional Quarterly. Separately, the respected National Journal reviewed 97 key roll-call votes in 2009, ultimately classing Cuellar as a "centrist." Based on those selected votes, the Journal rated him the 215th most liberal member of the House, which also makes him the 216th most conservative. That hits the median position in the center exactly. Summing up: Underwood misspoke when he said "last session" in referring to votes that took place over the last House session (2009) as well as the current one (2010). He also wasn’t as precise as he could have been if he intended delegates to think he was talking about Cuellar lock-stepping with fellow Democrats, rather than just Speaker Pelosi. Still, Cuellar tends to vote nearly all the time with her — and with his party. Cuellar voted nearly 90 percent of the time just like Pelosi last session and this session, he voted just like her on the 23 occasions they’ve both voted. Since January 2009, Cuellar has voted 96 percent of the time in alignment with most fellow Democrats. We rate Underwood’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-10824	Her health care plan will cost $110-billion in the first year, which can be paid for with savings.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/18/hillary-clinton/optimistic-math/	The health care plan proposed by Clinton doesn't offer lots of details, but in one spot the figure is in black and white: first-year cost, $110-billion. The proposal goes on to show how that cost would be paid for with savings from other changes to the health care system. There's no way to verify the $110-billion figure, but those off-setting savings? They're pretty optimistic, which is why we rate this claim as half-true. Much of the savings would come from "discontinuing" the 2001 tax cuts to households with incomes over $250,000 per year, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. Clinton, like most Democrats, has proposed letting those high-income tax cuts expire, which the Congressional Budget Office says would generate $52-billion in tax revenues. Over half of the $110-billion would come from such things as saving $10-billion by phasing out excessive Medicare payments to HMOs and other managed care plans. While it is true that the $10-billion in overpayments to Medicare HMOs exists in the system, so far the Senate has not agreed to such cuts. Whether Congress under a Clinton presidency would agree to slash reimbursements to a powerful private insurance lobby is yet to be seen. The plan also estimates that $35-billion could be saved by "modernizing the health system" by encouraging health care providers to adopt cost-saving information technology programs and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Clinton's policy expert said the figure is a very conservative estimate and multiple studies suggest the actual figure will be much higher. The Clinton campaign cited a 2005 Rand Corp. study that put the potential savings at $77-billion per year. But that study is not without critics. Dr. David Himmelstein and Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, practicing physicians as well as professors at Harvard Medical School, criticized the Rand study, noting that it was funded by a technology company. At the time, the two physicians wrote in Health Affairs , "For decades, vendors have capitalized on this enthusiasm. But hospitals and clinics have ended up with little to show for their large outlays." Himmelstein said Tuesday that promises of big savings through information technology is "pure vaporware." "And though there's some evidence that disease management improves care, there's no evidence it saves money," he said. "People getting in to see their doctors means more cost, not less."

pomt-02824	"Harry Reid was against (the nuclear option) before he was for it. Mitch McConnell was for it before he was against it. President Obama was against it before he was for it."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/24/matthew-dowd/matthew-dowd-says-barack-obama-harry-reid-and-mit/	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the "nuclear option," meaning the Senate can now approve President Barack Obama’s executive and judicial nominations (except for the Supreme Court) with a simple 51-vote majority. Previously, appointments could be blocked by a filibuster, which would require 60 votes to break. On This Week, ABC political analyst Matthew Dowd criticized politicians on both sides of the aisle for changing their viewpoints on the nuclear option. "There's a virus going around Washington, D.C., and it's a virus of hypocrisy," said Dowd, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. "Harry Reid was against this before he was for it. Mitch McConnell was for it before he was against it. President Obama was against it before he was for it." PunditFact won’t make a judgment call about whether politicians’ changes in opinion are justified. We’ll just review if and how their stances have changed, which we’ve already analyzed on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter for Obama, Reid and McConnell. Let’s go back in time to see if Dowd’s correct. Take 2005: Bush was starting his second term with a Republican majority in the Senate. Democrats filibustered a host of Bush’s nominees, so the Republicans considered invoking the nuclear option. Obama (then a freshman senator), McConnell and Reid were all involved in the filibuster debate. Sounds familiar. How did their 2005 positions compare to what they’ve said and done in 2013? Obama In 2005, Obama was in the Senate minority. Here’s what he had to say on the Senate floor that April about approving nominations with a simple majority: "The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse." He’s changed his tune now that he’s in Bush’s shoes. "I support the step a majority of senators today took to change the way that Washington is doing business -- more specifically, the way the Senate does business," Obama said on Nov. 21. "What a majority of senators determined by Senate rule is that they would restore the longstanding tradition of considering judicial and public service nominations on a more routine basis." Reid In 2005, Reid was the minority leader. On the Senate floor that May, he spoke against the nuclear option, the very same procedural change he invoked as the majority leader seven years later. "You should not be able to come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate," he said, addressing Bush. He then referred to the nuclear option as "foolishness." But in 2013, with a president from his own party trying to approve nominees, Reid invoked that very option. "Gridlock has consequences and they're terrible," he said to the Senate. "It's not only bad for President Obama, bad for this body, the United States Senate, it's bad for our country." McConnell We’ve established that Democratic leaders have changed their stances, but what about the Republican leadership? McConnell, now the Senate minority leader, was the majority whip in 2005. Back then, he spoke in favor of stopping the filibusters. "The majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor," he said on the Senate floor in May 2005. Fast forward to 2013, and McConnell’s criticizing the Democrats for trying to "break the rules to change the rules." "Let me say we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer," he said. Our ruling Dowd accused leaders like Obama, Reid and McConnell of changing their stances on the Senate’s nuclear option. In 2005, when there was a Republican president and Senate majority, McConnell and others advocated for (but never invoked) an end to filibustering nominees. Now, when a Democratic president and Senate majority have invoked the same change, McConnell opposed it. Meanwhile, Democrats like Obama and Reid supported the same change they fiercely attacked during the Bush administration. We rate Dowd’s claim True.

pomt-12002	Alabama is "the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/22/luther-strange/alabama-ranks-high-charitable-giving-not-no-1-luth/	During a debate against Republican primary rival Roy Moore, Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., urged policies to strengthen the economy -- in part because it would encourage more charitable giving. "People need to be able to provide for their families so they can give money to their churches and to their charities," Strange said. "We're the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities." Is it correct that Alabama is "the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities"? We found that the state does rank high in monetary donations, but it’s not No. 1 in recent rankings. (The Strange campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) The WalletHub study One recent and comprehensive assessment of state-by-state charity was published by the personal finance website WalletHub in November 2016. The site looked at two broad categories of charity -- a "volunteering and service" category and a "charitable giving" category. Since Strange spoke about monetary gifts, we’ll focus on that portion of WalletHub’s calculations in this fact-check. To create a state’s rank for the charitable giving category, the website melded together several measurements. One that received double-weighting to increase its importance in the calculation was the percentage of residents’ income that was donated to charity. The additional, single-weighted measurements included the percentage of taxpayers who donated money, the number of public charities per capita, the number of food banks per capita, and the percentage of sheltered homeless residents. When the website crunched the numbers, Alabama ended up as fourth in charitable giving, behind Utah, Arkansas and Minnesota. Zeroing in specifically on the percentage of residents’ income donated to charity, Alabama finished one notch higher -- No. 3, behind Utah and Mississippi. (A separate study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy published in 2014 also placed those three states in the same order for percentage of income donated to charity.) So Alabama ranked high among the states, though Strange was exaggerating when he said it was No. 1 in the nation. The SmartAsset study Another study by a personal-finance website came out a few months earlier. The SmartAsset study looked at two slightly different measurements. One was charitable contributions per capita. On this measurement, Alabama ranked no higher than 13th. (The website listed only the top 25 states in overall rank, so Alabama could be lower than 13th.) The other measurement in the SmartAsset study was the median size of charitable contributions. In this category, Alabama fared better -- it was No. 2 after Utah. But Alabama still isn’t No. 1 in the nation, as Strange said. Some caveats While both studies found Alabama with high rates of monetary donations, the state scored less well in charitable activities such as volunteering. In the WalletHub study, Alabama ranked 46th in the "volunteering and service" category, only rating higher than California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The factors used to measure this category included volunteer rate, volunteer retention rate, volunteer hours per capita, and percentage of population collecting or distributing food and clothes. When WalletHub averaged the "charitable giving" and "volunteering and service categories" to create an overall state rank, Alabama ended up at 30th -- below average nationally. As for the SmartAsset study, Alabama ended up in 19th place overall, or above average nationally. The four factors used to produce the SmartAsset ranking were charitable contributions per capita, median charitable contribution, value of volunteer time per capita, and nonprofits per capita. "Volunteering is incredibly valuable to nonprofits," said Joannie Tremblay-Boire, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. "It can be just as important as cash or goods. Organizations just would not be able to function without volunteers." (Tremblay-Boire helped advise WalletHub on its study.) Explaining charity patterns in Alabama Using the metric Strange appeared to focus on -- monetary giving -- Alabama is well positioned to do well in national rankings, because it ranks relatively low in income and relatively high in church membership. Alabama has the sixth-lowest median income in the nation, while it ranks first in the Pew Research Center’s ranking of states by the importance of religion, based on survey data. These two factors tend to help Alabama in the rankings because when you calculate the percentage of income donated to charity in each state, Alabama’s denominator (income) is relatively small, while the numerator (charitable donations) is relatively large, since church donations are included in donation total. The usual No. 1 state in these types of studies, Utah, has a much higher income level for its denominator -- Utah’s median income ranks 12th nationally -- but that is outweighed by its unusually high level of church donations in the numerator. In Utah, 55 percent of the state’s residents identify as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (or Mormons), which expects tithing. Our ruling Strange said that Alabama is "the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities." Looking at the monetary side of charity, Alabama does rank high on state-by-state lists, though we couldn’t find one where it placed No. 1 nationally. Utah ranks first in most studies. Meanwhile, if you look instead at volunteer work, Alabama ranks significantly lower than many states. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-14523	"People have actually broken down the transcripts for oral arguments and (Antonin Scalia) told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices."	true	/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/17/stephen-colbert/colbert-scalia-told-more-jokes-and-got-more-laughs/	As Antonin Scalia is memorialized for his conservative influence on the Supreme Court and legal theory, Stephen Colbert paid tribute to the late justice’s "great sense of humor." "People have actually broken down the transcripts for oral arguments," Colbert said on Feb. 15’s Late Show, "and he told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices." The comedian then shared a memory of Scalia being one of the few people to enjoy Colbert’s controversial address lampooning the George W. Bush administration at the 2006 White House Correspondents Association Dinner. Colbert's line got us wondering: Is there really data that shows Scalia made more jokes than any other justice? Or was Colbert, himself, just telling a joke? A spokesperson for CBS did not get back to us, but we found plenty of evidence backing Colbert’s point. King of laughs Researchers and Supreme Court watchers have been counting how many chuckles each justice has earned since 2004, when court reporters began identifying the nine members by name. Laughs are demarcated as (Laughter.) in oral argument transcripts. Really. This is a thing. Out of six Supreme Court terms dating back to 2004, Scalia has taken the crown for funniest justice every term. Overall, he was responsible for about 40 percent of the laughter (352 out of 919 laughs). Here’s a breakdown: Jay Wexler, a Boston University law professor and first person to count Supreme Court laughs in 2005, told PolitiFact that Scalia always came in first place for as long as he’s been tracking them. "Justice Scalia was a brash questioner and would say things people didn’t necessarily expect, which helps account for his laughs," he said. Take, for example, the giggles he got in Jan. 19’s argument for Heffernan vs. City of Patterson, in which Jeffrey Heffernan sued for the city for demoting him based on the mistaken perception that he was taking part in a political campaign. Attorney Thomas Goldstein, representing the city, argued that the case was "bizarre" given that Heffernan was politically apathetic and therefore not exercising his constitutional right to free speech. "It is bizarre," Scalia chimed in. "Do you really believe, Mr. Goldstein, that the Constitution does not solve all problems?" (Laughter.) ensued. Scalia is actually 64 percent funnier than the transcripts show, drawing more laughter than the bottom seven justices combined, according to a 2012 paper by litigation consultant and communications expert Ryan Malphurs. In a separate analysis, Malphurs noted the wide range of Scalia’s wisecracking. He made humorous hypotheticals, poked fun at himself and joked with advocates and the other justices. Witness Scalia riffing with Justice Anthony Kennedy in March 2007’s oral argument for Morse vs. Frederick, a case about whether the First Amendment protected students to express pro-drug use views: Justice Kennedy: "So under your view, if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street, had to come up and say now, how many of you here are truants — I can’t discipline you because you’re a truant, you can go ahead and throw the bottle (Laughter.)" Mr. Mertz: "No I don’t think she needs to do that in the heat of the moment. But later on once she’s discovered the true facts, then at that point I think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student if he was not there as a student." Justice Scalia: "Because you’re both a truant and a disrupter, you get off. (Laughter.) Had you been just a disrupter, tough luck. (Laughter.)" The joshing wasn’t always good-natured, Malphurs told PolitiFact in an interview. Scalia joked pleasantly with Justices Stephen Breyer and Clarence Thomas outside of court, but Breyer, one of the court’s more liberal members, often bore the brunt of merciless teasing from Scalia in court. "Scalia's humor was dependent on the tone that he wanted to take and the position he wanted to take," Malphurs said. "The humor was goodnatured if he agreed with the advocate. If he disagreed with the advocate, it tended to be sarcastic and belittling." A noted wit Scalia’s sarcasm shown especially in his opinions. Between 1986 and 2013, Scalia was quantifiably the most sardonic justice, penning more "sarcastic" or "caustic" opinions (75) than all the other justices combined. For context, Justice John Paul Stephens came in second with nine sarcastic opinions. In his controversial Obergefell vs. Hodges dissent, Scalia denounced gay marriage and skewered his colleagues, writing, "The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie." And then there's his hyperbolic refrain in his King vs. Burwell dissent: "Understatement, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act! … Impossible possibility, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act! … Contrivance, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!" Of course, some have found Scalia’s acerbic lines to be extremely offensive. But sometimes that was the the point, as shown by the Scalia-isms the justice "unleashed" on the court. Here are a few via intellectual property lawyer Yury Kapgan: • "A fiction of Jack-and-the-Beanstalk proportions ..."; • "'We’ll-look-at-all-the-circumstances-and-see-if-it-looks-dangerous’ approach ..."; • "'It-is-so-because-we-say-so’ jurisprudence ..."; • "The original-meaning-is-irrelevant, good-policy-is-constitutional-law school of jurisprudence ..."; • "Thoreauvian ‘you-may-do-what-you-like-so-long-as-it-does-not-injure-someone-else’ beau ideal ..." Whether Scalia joked to lighten the mood of oral arguments or used humor bitingly in legal prose, one thing is for sure. "He liked to laugh and to make people laugh," said Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and friend of Scalia’s. Our ruling Colbert said, "People have actually broken down the transcripts for oral arguments and (Scalia) told more jokes and got more laughs than any of the other justices." This wasn't a joke. Out of six Supreme Court terms spanning 2004 to 2016, Scalia produced about 40 percent of all the laughter transcribed in oral arguments. That’s more than any other justice overall and more than any other justice every term. We rate Colbert’s claim True.	None	Stephen Colbert	None	None	None	2016-02-17T17:27:31	2016-02-15	['None']
pomt-04761	"If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years."	true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-illegal-immigration-net-zero/	As millions watch them during their national convention in Tampa, Republicans are trying to appear tough on illegal immigration without offending Hispanic voters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is bilingual and met his wife in Mexico, has warned his fellow Republicans they need to watch their tone on the immigration issue. He repeated that warning in an interview on Meet the Press the weekend before the convention. "My personal view is that we need to get beyond where we are," Bush said. "We need to create a climate of border control. And that’s begun to happen, if you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it’s net zero. It’s been that way now for almost two years. And if you say, well, we’ve gotten a much better grasp on the number of people just coming in without papers, then you could develop a strategy that’s part of economic growth. …" For this fact-check, we will research whether Bush was correct when he said the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country is net zero, and that it’s been that way for two years. Pew Hispanic Center studies We turned to the Pew Hispanic Center for an answer. The center is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues. Its 2012 report about Mexican immigration concluded, "After four decades that brought 12 million current immigrants -- most of whom came illegally -- the net migration flow from Mexico to the United States has stopped and may have reversed." The report was based on the center’s analysis of federal census data. We interviewed Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew and an expert on Hispanic immigration. He said that Bush’s claim is true. Passel said that we can infer that the outflow of unauthorized immigrants exceeded inflows between 2007 and 2009 because the overall size of the unauthorized population living in the U.S. decreased between 2007 and 2009 from 12 million to 11.1 million. There are four ways the number of unauthorized immigrants changes: the inflow of new unauthorized immigrants, the outflow of those leaving the U.S., deaths and unauthorized immigrants gaining legal status. Those last three categories -- outflow out of the U.S., deaths and conversion to legal status -- exceeded the first category of new inflows of unauthorized immigrants by about 900,000 between 2007 and 2009. But deaths and conversion to legal status are not large figures. Therefore, Passel said, "the major source of the decline is almost certainly an excess of outflow of unauthorized over inflow." You can read about Pew’s reports about net migration from Mexico here and in general about trends in the illegal immigration population here and here. We also sent Bush’s claim to groups with opposing views on immigration and all agreed that Bush’s statement was correct. "I think you will find everybody agrees with it being zero or close to it," said Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates for low immigration. A spokeswoman for The National Immigration Forum, which advocates for immigrants, sent us a New York Times op-ed piece co-written by two professors, one a former foreign minister of Mexico and the other co-director of the Mexican Migration Project at Princeton. That op-ed piece also stated that the rate of undocumented immigration is nearing zero. Our ruling Bush said "If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero. It's been that way now for almost two years." It is difficult to get a precise figure on the population of illegal immigrants. But data from Pew Hispanic Center, a widely respected source referred to by those of different political viewpoints on immigration, supports Bush’s claim. We rate this claim True.

pomt-02719	"Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/22/physicians-committee-responsible-medicine/physicians-committee-responsible-medicine-says-rho/	Rhode Island was treated to an interesting do-the-ends-justify-the-means debate last week when the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. Besides objecting to the treatment of the animals involved, the committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in the Ocean State. To drive that point home, the committee has begun an advertising campaign with posters on five Providence bus shelters, claiming "Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average. But Brown researchers are not helping teens. Instead, they are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets." We’ll pass on whether getting pigs drunk is a waste of federal money. But we wondered whether Rhode Island’s rate of teen binge drinking is that high. Two federal agencies that track teenage alcohol use, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, define binge drinking as having five or more drinks at the same occasion, at the same time or within a couple of hours. Physicians Committee spokeswoman Jeanne S. McVey said the group came up with its statistic by using data from two federal agencies that track, among other things, alcohol use by the nation’s teenagers. She cited a 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found that 7.2 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 nationwide reported at least one instance of binge drinking over the previous 30 days. But that study didn’t break down its findings by state. For a Rhode Island number, McVey said, the committee turned to a 2013 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, a survey of a cross section of the nation’s high school students, done every two years. According to documents posted on the state Health Department website, that survey found that in Rhode Island, 15.1 percent of responding students in grades 9 through 12 said they had at least one binge-drinking experience in the previous 30 days. Rhode Island’s 15.1 percent, as reported in the CDC study, is more than twice the national average of 7.2 percent, as reported in the SAMHSA study, McVey said. But those are numbers from two different studies. Is it legitimate to compare them in that way? No, said statistician Jeffrey E. Jarrett, a professor of finance decision science at the University of Rhode Island. To be valid, Jarrett said, comparisons must be drawn from the same data -- in other words, surveys that ask the same questions to the same people. Even a slight difference in wording between questionnaires can make a difference. "The only way to compare is to compare things within the same study," he said. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, we returned to the CDC study. The agency has not yet compiled national averages for its 2013 study. But in its 2011 survey, the Rhode Island teen binge-drinking rate was 18.3 percent, compared with 21.9 percent for the nation as a whole. So the Rhode Island rate was actually less than the national one, not double. When we pointed out the flaws in the committee’s methodology, McVey acknowledged that the organization could have been more careful. "We now see that we should have had an expert in statistics double check, because we were comparing one set of national statistics to one set of local statistics," McVey said. " … If we were to do it over again, we would certainly word it differently." "Our larger point is true," she added. "Federal funds should go to helping people rather than to animal experiments that often do not result in treatment for human patients." Our ruling Regardless of your opinion on the larger point, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine sought to make it with an incorrect comparison. It claimed "Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average," deriving that claim by comparing numbers from two different surveys. But the most recent report that includes both national and state-by-state figures show that Rhode Island’s rate was actually less than the national average. We rule the claim False.

pomt-13050	"Alexander Hamilton was an immigration hawk."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/22/rush-limbaugh/trump-hamilton-was-immigration-hawk-rush-limbaugh-/	If the actors in the hit broadway musical Hamilton knew anything about the real Alexander Hamilton, they might not like him so much, said conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. At the end of a Nov. 18 Hamilton performance, cast members made an appeal to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who was in attendance and had been booed by some in the audience. Speaking for the cast, Brandon Victor Dixon (who portrays Aaron Burr) said they hoped the show inspired Pence to work on behalf of all Americans and uphold the country’s collective values. But the real Alexander Hamilton, as opposed to the character in the musical, might not be the role model for Pence the cast members would like, Limbaugh said on his show Nov. 21. The ten-dollar founding father and first secretary of the Treasury believed in monarchy and aristocracy, and he even held tough views on immigration that were similar to Trump’s. "Do you know that Alexander Hamilton was an immigration hawk?" Limbaugh said. "I wonder if the people in this cast have any idea who they are lionizing and celebrating. This guy's Donald Trump." Hamilton himself has an immigrant story. He came to the American colonies from the British West Indies as a poor, teenage orphan. So we wondered if Limbaugh’s assertion was correct. We’re not throwing away our shot to fact-check this claim. We asked historians and consulted some of Hamilton’s written work, and we found that over his life, Hamilton showed support for both increasing and limiting immigration. Experts said Limbaugh’s portrayal of Hamilton as an "immigration hawk" lacks nuance. "In short, Hamilton wasn't quite anti-immigrant. But he wasn't always pro-immigrant either," said Joanne Freeman, a Yale University history professor who has edited a volume of Hamilton’s writings. Pro-immigration Prior to the United States’ Quasi-War with France in the late 1790s — which we’ll talk about shortly — Hamilton and other members of the Federalist Party were rather dovish on immigration, said Stephen Knott, a professor at the Naval War College and author of Alexander Hamilton and the Persistence of Myth. "So his position is perhaps more complex than Limbaugh suggests," Knott said. Hamilton occasionally argued for policies that would encourage immigration. In his 1791 Report on Manufactures, for example, he said manufacturing would benefit the United States in part because it would invite immigrants, expanding the population and labor force. "Here is perceived an important resource, not only for extending the population, and with it the useful and productive labour of the country, but likewise for the prosecution of manufactures," he wrote of immigrants. Hamilton also argued against requiring people to be native-born or to have lived in America a certain number of years in order to be eligible to serve in Congress, according to the historian Ron Chernow’s biography of Hamilton (which inspired the musical). Hamilton said this would attract foreigners of "moderate fortunes" to the United States, where they would be of the same status as the country’s earliest citizens. (Hamilton lost this fight — the Constitution has a residency period requirement for immigrants who want to seek congressional office.) Pro-limiting immigration But when the United States engaged in naval war with France at the end of the French Revolution, Hamilton and others were concerned that French people in America might try to undermine the United States government from within, Knott said. In response, Hamilton supported the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which increased the length of time it took to become a citizen and gave the president the authority to imprison or deport foreigners perceived as "dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States." Hamilton’s support for these laws was qualified, however. He worried that the acts were susceptible to abuse, and he warned other Federalists not to take any actions that could lead to tyrannical rule, Knott said. Hamilton also fretted about the political and cultural impact immigrants would have on the United States, Freeman said. Hamilton spoke out against then-President Thomas Jefferson’s proposal to allow for a dramatic influx of new citizens, saying that Jefferson might not have won the 1800 election if only American-born citizens had voted. "To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country, as recommended in the message, would be nothing less than to admit the Grecian horse into the citadel of our liberty and sovereignty," Hamilton wrote in 1801 — noting, though, that he did not want to halt immigration completely. Freeman said it's difficult to compare the concept of immigration today to what it meant in early America because at the time, a large portion of the population had come from Great Britain and had only been in America for a few decades. While calling Limbaugh’s claim an "overreaction" to the way Hamilton is portrayed in Hamilton, Freeman said the musical implies that the historical figure was more unquestionably pro-immigrant than he actually was. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "Alexander Hamilton was an immigration hawk." Limbaugh has a point that Hamilton did have some skepticism about immigrants. For several years, Hamilton favored limiting the flow of immigrants into the United States in order to preserve American culture and politics, and he offered qualified support for the Alien and Sedition Acts. But earlier in his political career, he supported policies that would encourage immigration to the United States.

At one point, in fact, Florida had the distinction of being the only U.S. state untouched by snow, according to the National Weather Service. Hoping to appeal to a frost-fatigued nation, Florida Gov. Rick Scott kicked off the "Share a Little Sunshine Tour" at a March 1, 2011, event in Orlando. Joined by a group of "Sunshine Ambassadors," Scott made stops in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Chicago, hoping to bring attention to the state with promotional events and Florida vacation prize give-aways. "Tourism is an important economic engine for Florida and employs nearly one million residents," Scott wrote in a Feb. 28 press release touting the "Share a Little Sunshine" campaign. "I am proud to lead VISIT FLORIDA’s Share a Little Sunshine campaign to bring more visitors to the Sunshine State," Scott wrote. "We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job, so I urge all Floridians to join with me in supporting this effort to increase jobs and grow the state’s economy." In a state reeling from an 11.9 percent unemployment rate, we wondered whether Scott’s claim about the rate of jobs created by tourists was true? "It’s simple math," said Kathy Torian, spokeswoman for Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing agency. In a March 7 phone interview, Torian said Scott’s figure was based on calculations using the number of tourists who visited Florida in 2010, divided by the number of Floridians employed in the leisure and hospitality industry. In 2010, 82.6 million tourists visited Florida, according to figures compiled by Visit Florida, with roughly one million Floridians employed in the leisure and hospitality industry. (The actual number, according the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is 928,000 as of December 2010.) If we use the million-workers figure, the ratio is 82.6 tourists per job. If we use the BLS job count, it's 89 tourists per job. We asked Torian how Visit Florida counts jobs and tourists, and found that both are estimates. Torian said the jobs count is pulled from the state Agency for Workforce Innovation and is seasonally adjusted. The employment categories used are air transportation; travel arrangement and reservation services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and accommodation and food services. Year-round residents and business travelers, not just tourists, contribute to those employment categories, too, of course. But we agree they are heavily tourist-dependent. To count tourists, the agency uses a method developed in 1999 that tracks visitors at 14 airports and applies a ratio of air to non-air visitors (meaning drivers). Foreign visitors are tracked through various travel research businesses. You can see the methodology here. For estimates of hard-to-track items like tourists and tourism-related jobs, the methods appear reasonable. Those figures may not exactly create an 85:1 ratio, but Torian said the governor was likely relying on previous numbers from 2007 when 84.5 million visitors made their way to the Sunshine State. The 85 tourists creating one job is a figure that has also been used in the past by Visit Florida executives such as this February 2011 press release. Scott said, "We know that every 85 visitors create one Florida job." While the number of tourists may have dropped off some since 2007, the proportion of tourism-driven jobs to tourists is still close to the ratio he touted. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08666	"I don’t understand what Republicans are doing against this. It was their idea. John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/13/john-boccieri/democratic-rep-john-boccieri-invokes-gop-sen-john-/	Democratic Rep. John Boccieri has taken heat from Republicans ever since his 2009 vote for a House energy bill that would establish a "cap and trade" system designed to reduce emission of the greenhouse gasses thought to cause global warming. The system would impose a government cap on allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, like electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or purchase credits to allow continued emissions. Either way, the cost likely would be passed along to consumers. Critics of the program have said it would be particularly harmful in Ohio, where a high proportion of electricity is derived from coal-burning power plants that would be most affected by the proposed law. Groups like the National Republican Congressional Committee have criticized Boccieri for his vote, placing ads in his district that say the system amounts to a nationwide electricity tax that would drive up the nation’s electricity rates. Boccieri, from Alliance, Ohio, has repeatedly said that he favored the bill because it would create renewable energy jobs in his district that can’t be shipped overseas, and would protect national security by reducing dependence on foreign oil from unstable regions like the Middle East. During an interview Aug. 18, he stated the "cap and trade" concept was originally a Republican idea, and expressed frustration with the GOP’s current opposition. "Only in Washington can you propose an idea, introduce legislation and then campaign against it," Boccieri said. "I don’t understand what Republicans are doing against this. It was their idea. John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times." Boccieri is correct that the "cap and trade" concept was pioneered by Republicans. MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins noted in July that Ronald Reagan used a "cap-and-trade" system to phase out leaded gasoline and George H.W. Bush established a "cap-and-trade" system that reduced the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain. In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the "Climate Stewardship Act," which would have used a similar cap-and-trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007. "The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies," McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. "Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life." McCain’s 2007 version was cosponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap-and-trade programs in their presidential platforms. If cap-and-trade legislation was backed by the 2008 presidential contenders from both political parties, why hasn’t it been a shoo-in for implementation? In short, working out the details has been complicated. The carbon emissions that cause global warming behave differently in the atmosphere than the sulfur emissions that cause acid rain, making it harder to design a "cap-and-trade" program that will control them. The acid rain program created in the ‘90s "addressed a relatively small number of major sources that could comply simply by using off-the-shelf-technology. By contrast, carbon dioxide is emitted from sources throughout the economy and cannot be sufficiently addressed by technology currently at our disposal," Ohio GOP Sen. George Voinovich told National Journal’s Congress Daily. Another culprit was legislative maneuvering by the lead sponsors of the House climate bill, Democrats Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. As The New York Times put it, in order to gain passage for the bill "a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions" were granted to "coal companies, utilities, refiners, heavy industry and agribusiness. The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals." McCain’s staff did not respond to our request to discuss his stance on the House cap-and-trade bill that Boccieri supported. Until late August, McCain faced a tough primary battle against former GOP congressman J. D. Hayworth, who had criticized McCain’s support for cap-and-trade. Energy expert Frank Maisano said McCain has been silent on the issue recently, because of "political pressures he was getting from the right" during that campaign. We find Boccieri’s statement that John McCain introduced cap and trade legislation three times to be True. Comment on this item.

pomt-08725	Alex Sink wants to "cut Medicare."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-wants-cut-medicare/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott says his opponent Alex Sink wants to cut Medicare benefits for the country's seniors. Sink says Scott is making that up. Enter PolitiFact Florida. The back-and-forth started on Sept. 1, 2010, when Scott issued a press statement commenting on the decision of Bud Chiles to drop his independent candidacy for governor and endorse Sink. "This (election) will be a contest which presents a clear choice between a conservative outsider with business experience and a specific plan to create 700,000 jobs, and another liberal Obamacrat who wants to raise taxes, cut Medicare, and supports Obama's failed stimulus," Scott said. Sink responded to the Medicare line the next morning. "I don't even know where he got that from," Sink said in Tallahassee. "Of course I don't want to cut Medicare." Does Sink want to cut Medicare? The Scott campaign pointed PolitiFact Florida to President Barack Obama's major health care legislation as evidence to back up their allegation. According to Scott-think, the linkage works like this: Sink supported the federal health care bill, and the health care bill cuts Medicare. Therefore Sink supports Medicare cuts. On the first part, Sink issued a tepid endorsement of the health care bill on March 22, 2010. "Though it is certainly not perfect, these long-overdue reforms are better than Washington continuing to do nothing to improve America's health care system," Sink said in part. You can read the rest of it here. The issue, in our minds, really boils down to the health care bill and how it affects Medicare. Medicare and the 2010 health care bill Medicare serves as the health insurance program for 39 million seniors and another eight million people under 65 receiving Social Security. Medicare makes up 12 percent of the federal budget. Naturally, Medicare reforms were part of the 2010 health care legislation. "Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage," said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care." Neuman walked through the changes in an easily digestible tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website. It's the best non-ideological explanation we've seen. The 2010 law includes a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D. Currently, after an initial benefit period, enrollees are required to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach a level of catastrophic coverage. The rebate is meant to begin to close in a hole in prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries. By 2020, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the total cost of generic prescription drug coverage in the gap. The health reform bill also reduces the growth in Medicare spending by more than $500 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. Nearly $220 billion in savings comes from reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion for increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative changes. A new national board will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. And then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plans), which are run by private insurers. They typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. A June 2009 MedPAC analysis said that the Advantage programs costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Obama has said repeatedly that the Medicare Advantage plan wastes public money that could be put to better use. "We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits," Obama said in Aug. 11, 2009, speech in New Hampshire. "The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides. And it's no better -- it doesn't result in better health care for seniors. It is a giveaway of $177 billion." The health care law that President Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs and institutes other rules for the program. Generally speaking, the extra payments phase out over the next three to six years. In a few cases, plans will be able to keep current funding if they qualify for special bonuses "How these payment changes will affect beneficiaries remains to be seen -- but is expected to vary across the country," Neuman said. "The Congressional Budget Office projects the law will result in fewer enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans, and fewer extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees, on average. It is also possible that the number of plans available to beneficiaries will decline -- which may or may not be a concern. On average, Medicare beneficiaries have 30 plans available to them in 2010." PolitiFact has waded into this ground before whether the adjustments to the Medicare Advantage option constitute a cut. Most experts we talked to had the same answer: yes and no. On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. Still, changes could be in store for Medicare Advantage participants. The basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same, but the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage would likely be reduced, experts said. "The core benefits of Medicare won't change," said Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, an advocate for health care consumers. "Most (Medicare Advantage) plans are solid and resemble traditional Medicare." However, some insurance plans have entered the program "to make a quick buck. They may have to reconsider their budget, which could mean some patients will see changes in the services provided above and beyond traditional Medicare." Stuart Guterman, assistant vice president for the Commonwealth Fund’s program on payment system reform, had a similar view. "People enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) get services that people in traditional care do not get under Medicare," he said. "Insurance companies can afford to cover these services because taxpayer money is subsidizing them. Plans will most likely not offer those extra services, but in no case will (patients) get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program." That's a key distinction when analyzing Scott's comments. Any cuts, if you can call them cuts, in the federal health care bill will happen to extra benefits for Medicare Advantage participants, experts say. Not the traditional Medicare program and the traditional Medicare benefits. Our ruling We must note that Medicare is a federal program, not a state one, so Sink wouldn't be able to cut benefits -- even if she wanted to -- if she's elected in November. Scott's basis for claiming that Sink supports cuts is that she supported the 2010 federal health care legislation that implemented a number of changes to the Medicare program. There are potential cuts coming to the extra benefits received by Medicare Advantage enrollees. But the law does not alter basic Medicare benefits, and actually increases some prescription drug benefits. Because she was not a member of Congress, Sink did not cast a vote for or against the new health law. Additionally, her endorsement was tepid: She said it was better than nothing and "far from perfect." On Medicare, she praised the part of the bill that spends more money on prescription drugs for seniors, and didn't say anything about the cuts for Medicare Advantage.

pomt-08222	A proposal to reduce the deficit "involved large tax cuts for the top bracket."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/17/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-obamas-deficit-co-chairs-suggest/	The co-chairs of President Barack Obama's deficit commission released their ideas for getting control of the federal deficit last week. Economist Paul Krugman had some pretty harsh words for them. "I think the most important thing to understand is that the commission did not do its job. It has a bunch of ideas for reducing the deficit, some good, some really bad, some of them not ideas about reducing the deficit at all," Krugman said on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "But it's easy to come up with ideas. I can come up with ideas for reducing the deficit while patting my tummy and rubbing my head, you know?" The key to reducing the deficit, Krugman said, is reducing the future growth of health care costs. "They completely wimped out on that," Krugman said. "They simply assumed they were going to reduce the rate of health care cost growth. And they said, how are we going to do that? By monitoring and taking additional measures as necessary. So the report was completely empty on the only thing that really matters and then had a whole bunch of things which involved large tax cuts for the top bracket. What on earth is that doing in there?" Here, we'll fact-check Krugman's statement that the plan included large tax cuts for the top bracket. We looked at his claim that the panel didn't address health care spending in a separate report. First, a bit about the commission: Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February, 2010, asking it to identify "policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run." Obama asked the commission to propose ideas designed to balance the budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. He appointed six members, including bipartisan co-chairs, and asked Congressional leaders from both parties -- Democrats Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Republicans Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- to appoint three each, for a total of 18 members. The proposal released Nov. 10 was not the final report, which requires approval from 14 of 18 members and has a deadline of Dec. 1. Rather, the proposal summarized the ideas of the two co-chairs: Alan Simpson, a former Republican Senator from Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. We're not sure why the two took the step of releasing their proposals ahead of the deadline; some news reports speculate it was an attempt to prod other members to keep negotiating before the December deadline. If the members are not able to come to an agreement, it's possible that no report will be issued. The co-chairs' proposal included several big ideas for changing the tax code. Its stated goals are to lower rates, simplify the tax code, broaden the base of taxable income, reduce tax exemptions and credits, improve compliance, make the tax code more business friendly and reduce the deficit. The proposal outlines several different options for how this can be achieved, but primarily it advocates eliminating exemptions and deductions and then lowering tax rates across the board. The proposal suggests several potential rate changes, depending on how many popular credits and exemptions are ended, such as the home mortgage interest deduction, the exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. The more exemptions and credits you curtail, the lower overall rates can be. It also includes tax measures that could increase taxes on the wealthy such as taxing capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, which means investors would pay higher taxes. If all exemptions were phased out, the co-chairs suggested the following rate reductions: • Combine the bottom two tax brackets with rates of 10 percent and 15 percent and lower the rate to 8 percent. • Combine the next two tax brackets with rates of 25 percent and 28 percent and lower the rate to 14 percent. • Combine the two highest tax brackets with rates of 33 percent and 35 percent and lower the rate to 23 percent. • Reduce the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent to 26 percent. Essentially, the proposal makes more income taxable while lowering overall rates, and it estimates that this would cause tax collection to go up, by about $80 billion in 2015 and a cumulative total of $751 billion for the years 2012 through 2020. The report also includes the following fairly broad caveat: "Rates based on very rough static estimates. No behavioral effects are assumed. Magnitude of tax expenditures estimated broadly." We e-mailed Krugman about his comments, and he told us he was primarily concerned with the rate reductions for taxpayers in the top incomes. In his New York Times column of Nov. 12, he explained his concerns in more detail: What the co-chairmen are proposing, Krugman wrote, "is a mixture of tax cuts and tax increases -- tax cuts for the wealthy, tax increases for the middle class. They suggest eliminating tax breaks that, whatever you think of them, matter a lot to middle-class Americans -- the deductibility of health benefits and mortgage interest -- and using much of the revenue gained thereby, not to reduce the deficit, but to allow sharp reductions in both the top marginal tax rate and in the corporate tax rate. "It will take time to crunch the numbers here, but this proposal clearly represents a major transfer of income upward, from the middle class to a small minority of wealthy Americans. And what does any of this have to do with deficit reduction?" Krugman didn't mention on This Week that the report also includes rate reductions for people of lower incomes. And he didn't mention the prospect of higher taxes on capital gains and dividends. We should note that the proposal also suggests more taxes for Social Security for higher incomes. Right now, taxes apply only to the first $106,800 of a person's income, and that number is indexed for inflation. The proposal suggests increasing that amount faster. So is it possible that the wealthy would pay less in taxes under such a plan? As we were researching this report, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published an initial analysis of the co-chairs' proposals. They analyzed the proposal two ways, comparing the recent proposal with current tax rates, and comparing it with what the rates would be if all the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were allowed to expire, which is current law. If you compare the proposal's suggestions to current tax rates, then the new plan does not give an advantage to tax payers with high incomes. Rather, it increases tax rates slightly for most taxpayers and increases them a bit more for the very highest earners. "If you're looking at it compared to current rates, it's about proportional," said Eric Toder, a co-author of the analysis. "It's actually raising taxes a little more than proportionally at the very high end." And in fact, the report found that the biggest changes are for taxpayers in the top 1 percent, and especially the top 0.1 percent -- the wealthiest of the wealthy. Toder said the tax increases at the top end are due in large part to the provision that allows capital gains and dividends to be taxed as ordinary income. If you compare the co-chairs' proposals to letting the Bush tax cuts expire completely, then the tax code becomes more regressive -- that is, skewed in favor of higher incomes. But that's because high earners -- the top 20 percent -- tended to benefit more from the Bush tax cuts, the report said. We should also note that because the changes the co-chairs suggest are so far-ranging, the Tax Policy Center did not attempt to model the behavioral effects of the tax changes, which means how people would make different decisions based on the new tax rates. These effects could be significant. "The problem is that there are so many moving parts put into motion with this plan, that it's hard to tell where things will settle out," said Roberton Williams, an economist and senior fellow at the center, who specializes in tax policy and its effect on the deficit. For example, if the home mortgage interest deduction is eliminated, the cost of owning a home goes up. That would influence people's decisions about whether to buy houses or not. That could affect the broader economy. And it's the same with charitable giving: If you eliminate the deduction for charitable donations, some taxpayers would stop giving to charity. That could affect the broader economy, too. "It is very difficult, if not impossible, to model this plan with the resources we have available today," he said. Getting back to our ruling statement, Krugman is right that the plan does include lower tax rates for the top incomes. But the plan also includes lower tax rates for people who make less, and it includes some tax increases for higher incomes. It gets rid of exemptions that have diverse effects. Overall, would taxes go down for the higher incomes? It's very difficult to say; even the analysis from the Tax Policy Center can't account for all the effects of such dramatic change. Krugman's comments on the plan on This Week left out a good bit of context. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2010-11-17T15:25:03	2010-11-14	['None']
pomt-01861	Another great endorsement! Barrow Journal explains the difference between me and Jody Hice.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/12/mike-collins/details-missing-endorsement-claim/	Political candidates are practically expected to lob more accusations at their opponents as the number of days before Election Day decreases. That’s why it is no shocker that the tight Republican runoff for the 10th Congressional District is heating up. The surprise is Jody Hice, a former minister and radio talk show host, is taking exception to businessman Mike Collins’ claim of a newspaper endorsement. Newspapers! How quaint. Collins took to Twitter to crow. "Another great endorsement! Barrow Journal explains the difference between me and Jody Hice," Collins wrote in a June 23 tweet. The post links to a June 20 column by Chris Bridges, editor of the weekly community newspaper. The problem, the Hice campaign says, is the newspaper does not endorse candidates. Any claim of an endorsement would be false, said Hice’s communications director, Clarke Brannon, who contacted PolitiFact Georgia for a fact check. "We’re trying to keep all of the facts on the table," Brannon said. "It’s not the paper that has endorsed him, just a personal column by the editor." Journalists love to debate the merits of endorsements almost as much as they love extolling the innate deliciousness of election night pizza. But if you’re not in a newsroom, and couldn't care less about PolitiFact’s poor dining choices, you likely need a quick primer on endorsements. Political endorsements are the public declarations from well-known people and organizations in support of a specific candidate. The goal is to use the name recognition and star power – not to mention money and connections – to boost one candidate in a race. Collins’ campaign has won that sort of an endorsement from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Hice’s campaign has earned an endorsement from Georgia Right To Life. Similarly, newspapers have long endorsed candidates from local, state and national races on their editorial pages. But a growing number of publications have backed away from endorsements in recent years, worried that the practice threatened journalistic independence of the news pages. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution still endorsed candidates in 2008 but began phasing it out a year later. A column before the May primary put it this way, "In an era when information on candidates is widely available, you don't need us to tell you how to vote." The Barrow Journal feels the same way for its official pages. It has not endorsed a candidate since its launch in 2008, editor Bridges said. Bridges said his column is meant to be his opinion alone. Neither campaign contacted him to clarify on his piece about the race, but he said he could see how the practice could be confusing to people outside a newsroom. "Most people don’t have a clue how it all works," Bridges said. "It’s my opinion, so if it’s taken as an endorsement at all, it’s my personal endorsement, not anything from the paper as a whole." Collins spokesman Brandon Phillips said the campaign understood the distinction. That’s why the tweet referenced an endorsement and the paper, without claiming an official endorsement. By contrast, the campaign’s Twitter feed clearly stated former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel had endorsed Collins on Monday. Phillips said Handel was also making calls on behalf of Collins, as Gingrich had done earlier. "When we roll out an endorsement, you know it’s an endorsement," Phillips said. Knowing is one thing. Caring is another issue altogether. A 2012 Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll found that most Republican voters didn’t think endorsements mattered in the presidential matchup. Whether the support was from specific figures such as Donald Trump, community leaders or, you guessed it, newspapers, the majority of the 1,000-person sample said endorsements did little to help and could even hurt a candidate. With all of that in mind, it appears Collins did refer to an endorsement and link to a newspaper column. But he did not claim a specific endorsement – which needs some explaining to understand. It’s that additional information that moves it down a bit on the AJC Truth-O-Meter. We rate Collins’ statement Half True.	None	Mike Collins	None	None	None	2014-07-12T00:00:00	2014-06-23	['None']
pomt-11368	"1 in 100 people are sociopaths."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/mar/30/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-1-100-people-sociopath/	A Texas congressman commenting on the man linked to bombings around Austin before blowing himself up made a claim about the prevalence of sociopaths that made us wonder. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, told Karina Kling on the March 26, 2018, edition of Spectrum News’ Capital Tonight: "He’s a sociopath. He claims I’ve been a psychopath all my life. You know, 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. They have no remorse or conscience or guilt when they commit acts of murder like in this case. So he had no remorse." A sociopath, per Merriam-Webster, is someone who behaves in a dangerous or violent way toward other people and doesn’t feel guilty about such behavior. And that describes 1 in 100 of us? A note: Our inquiries about McCaul’s claim led us to recognize that experts don’t necessarily use the word "sociopath." For instance, the American Psychiatric Association responded to our inquiry about sociopaths by pointing out diagnostic criteria for "antisocial personality disorder." The disorder’s essential feature is a "pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood," according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual further says its prevalence has been found to range from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent. McCaul cites FBI article But Lizzie Litzow of McCaul’s office told us by email that McCaul had relied on research into another disorder as described in a 2012 article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled "Psychopathy." That word, the article says, "refers to a personality disorder that includes a cluster of interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and antisocial traits and behaviors." The article continues: "These involve deception; manipulation; irresponsibility; impulsivity; stimulation seeking; poor behavioral controls; shallow affect; lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse; sexual promiscuity; callous disregard for the rights of others; and unethical and antisocial behaviors. "Psychopathy," the article goes on, "is the most dangerous of the personality disorders." Among indicators, the article says, is "a profound lack of remorse for their aggressive actions, both violent and nonviolent, along with a corresponding lack of empathy for their victims. This central psychopathic concept enables them to act in a cold-blooded manner, using those around them as pawns to achieve goals and satisfy needs and desires, whether sexual, financial, physical, or emotional. Most psychopaths are grandiose, selfish sensation seekers who lack a moral compass—a conscience—and go through life taking what they want. They do not accept responsibility for their actions and find a way to shift the blame to someone or something else." To McCaul’s point, the article says it’s estimated that "approximately 1 percent of the general male population are psychopaths, and 15 to 20 percent of the prison population are psychopathic." Psychopathy checklist That "1 percent" statement, we noticed, is footnoted to an article by psychologist Robert D. Hare, who invented and then refined a heralded diagnostic assessment of psychopathy dubbed the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Items gauged by an expert using the checklist include a subject’s glibness/superficial charm; egocentricity; lack of remorse or guilt; parasitic lifestyle; and impulsivity. As summed up in another researcher’s 2016 article, Hare’s scale "amalgamated many of the traits and behaviors of psychopathy using conceptual and statistical methods to provide for a more objective and dimensional assessment of psychopathy in criminal populations." We read the chapter noted by McCaul’s aide via the University of Texas library catalog and learned that Hare’s 1-in-100 statement lacked certainty. Hare wrote: "In spite of their small numbers--perhaps 1% of the general population--they constitute a significant proportion of our prison populations and are responsible for a markedly disproportionate amount of serious crime, violence, and social distress." Next, we reached Hare, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. He advised by email that many years ago he’d offered the 1 percent estimate as an informed guess -- and it held up in subsequent studies. Still, he stressed, such calculations rest in deciding what score on the checklist scale demonstrates that a person is a psychopath--and researcher judgments vary. As measured, Hare elaborated, "psychopathy is dimensional and not a diagnostic category. So, about all we can say is that around 1% of the male population would receive a score of 30" on the extended exam or a score of 18 on a shorter version. Hare also told us he doesn’t use "sociopath" when he’s talking about psychopaths. Sociopaths, he suggested, are capable of feeling remorse or guilt. Hare later said by phone he’s unaware of surveys gauging the prevalence of sociopaths but he’d expect the percentage to be "fairly high." Other experts We also heard back from Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychology professor. Lilienfeld said by email that the oft-cited 1 percent figure, rooted in research employing Hare’s checklist, "may be defensible, although it is also oversimplified." He also pointed out a 2013 Emory University breakdown of misconceptions about psychopathic personalities including, it says, the idea that a person with psychopathy poses more than a modest risk of heightened violence. "Evidence suggests," Lilienfeld told us, "that psychopathy isn’t an either-or phenomenon; instead, it is continuously distributed, much like height and weight. So there is no scientific cut-off for distinguishing psychopaths from non-psychopaths. As a result, the 1 percent figure isn’t exactly wrong, but it’s somewhat misleading because it implies that 1 in 100 people are somewhat different in kind – rather than in degree - from the rest of us. Instead, psychopathy blends imperceptibly into normality," Lilienfeld said. Summing up, Lilienfeld called the 1-in-100 statistic informative in that it indicates "that a nontrivial proportion of people walking among us are markedly elevated on traits such as superficial charm, social dominance, self-centeredness, dishonesty, manipulativeness, callousness, poor impulse control, and casual sexual relationships," he wrote. Also to our inquiry, John Petrila of the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute pointed out a 2009 study, by researchers including Hare, that gauged the general prevalence of psychopathy. According to the study’s abstract, the researchers concluded -- after using Hare’s checklist to screen 638 individuals aged 16 to 74 in England, Wales and Scotland -- that "psychopathy is rare, affecting less than 1% of the household population, although it is prevalent among prisoners, homeless persons and psychiatric admissions." By email, Petrila also noted a 2015 study that says in its abstract that "psychopathy is almost exclusively investigated within criminal populations so that its prevalence in the general population has been inferred by psychopathic traits rather than disorder (1%)." That study takes note of a 2011 study by researchers at the Queensland Institute of Technology, in Australia, that had 300 members of the general population complete a self-reported version of the psychopathy checklist and undertake a test of deception qualities. "Results indicated that at least 1% of the current community displayed characteristics consistent with psychopathic tendencies," the study’s abstract says, with "younger males who tend to misuse alcohol" found most likely to have the tendencies. Our ruling McCaul said 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. Mental health experts steer clear of "sociopath" to characterize individuals who don’t show remorse, among antisocial qualities. Still, research suggests that about 1 percent of the population consists of psychopaths though it’s also worth clarifying that such judgments are reached on a scale. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03717	Says Texas lawmakers in 2011 ordered school districts to test every student on their respiratory system and weight.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/16/mike-villarreal/mike-villarreal-says-2011-legislature-imposed-phys/	The 2011 Legislature might best be remembered for cuts in spending, including changes to education aid. Lawmakers also directed schools to check the physical fitness of students, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, told House colleagues during April 4, 2013, consideration of proposed amendments to the pending 2014-15 state budget. "During the last legislative session in 2011, there was a program that was created that requires all of our public schools to collect health information on students, to test them on their respiratory system, on their weight," he said. "It’s called FitnessGram. Every school district, every school, implements this program, collects the data, sends it to" the Texas Education Agency. We looked into the accuracy of his flashback after inquiring into why he mentioned the mandate. The day he spoke, Villarreal won House approval of an amendment to that body’s version of the next budget. Villarreal described his amendment as enabling state researchers to access and analyze results of the fitness tests collected by the agency. Asked if researchers are restricted from getting such results now, Villarreal’s chief of staff, Peter Clark, said by email the agency "has been slow to provide this data to researchers, so we wanted to communicate legislative direction." So, did the 2011 Legislature set the fitness tests in motion? Nope. It turns out state law has required students in grades three through 12 to take fitness tests since the 2007-08 school year, though the 2011 Legislature tweaked the law to limit the aerobic, abdominal, flexibility and upper body tests to students enrolled in physical education classes, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us by phone. The 2007 Legislature established the mandate that students be tested for fitness, which came along with a fresh requirement that middle school students take physical education classes. At the time, advocates included state Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who told the Austin American-Statesman in June 2007 that she was troubled by studies showing some fifth-graders were overweight. "Anyone who has taught public school knows the old adage of 'sound body, sound mind' really is true," Nelson said. "This generation of young people will live shorter lives than their parents unless we change the status quo. We've got to do this." The Statesman reported that the FitnessGram software had been developed by Kenneth Cooper, the well-known Dallas exercise researcher. Under the law, each district must annually assess the physical fitness of students in PE classes, with a state-ordered "assessment instrument" considering factors including aerobic capacity, body composition and muscular strength, endurance and flexibility, the law says. Also, the law requires the exam to include standards specific to each student’s age and gender and to be based on the "physical fitness level required for good health." A FitnessGram manual suggests that students run or walk and have their percentage of body fat gauged, either through a skin-fold test using calipers or by measuring height and weight. Other suggested tests include curl-ups (or sit-ups) and push-ups. (Parents of students in the Austin school district may request their child’s FitnessGram report from the school’s PE teacher, the district’s PE supervisor, Michele Rusnak, said by phone. She added that in instances where "anything really glaring" emerges in a test, the teacher talks to the school nurse, who reaches out to the student’s parents.) By email, Culbertson said aggregated school-by-school or district-by-district results, which do not identify individual students, are available online. How’s it been going for the kids? Unevenly, it appears. Statewide through 2009-10, the vast majority of Texas students had failed to pass all six Fitnessgram tests, according to an April 18, 2011, Statesman news article. More recently, nearly 46 percent of more than two million Texas children who participated in the 2012 tests were found to be at risk for obesity, according to the Reshaping Texas web site, which was created at legislative direction by State Comptroller Susan Combs. Some 54 percent of the tested students achieved a "healthy fitness zone" rating, according to the site, which features an interactive map for checking particular districts. In the Austin district, according to the map, 32 percent of students who were tested came out at high risk of obesity, 12 percent were at some risk and 55 percent landed in the "healthy fitness zone." Finally, we hop-skipped to asking why Villarreal, a House member since 2000, traced the origin of the fitness tests to 2011. By email, Clark said the representative was reflecting on a 2011 proposal tightening what school districts report to the state about how students fare on the tests. Previously, the law said districts should report summary data from the tests, broken out by grade level and other sifts as ordered by the state education commissioner. Members in 2011 changed the law to require districts to report each student’s performance, though the law continued to bar any student from being identified in the reports by name or otherwise. Clark later said Villarreal mistakenly said the tests were mandated by the 2011 Legislature. Our ruling Villarreal said the 2011 Legislature ordered Texas students to take fitness tests including checks of weight and respiratory systems. The mandated tests can involve checking each student’s weight and the aerobic tests relate to respiration. But lawmakers launched the program a few years earlier, in 2007, though they approved changes in 2011. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-11624	"When we say ‘one vote matters,’ it’s not just a saying – it has proven true 141 times in #Ohio over the last five years."	true	/ohio/statements/2018/jan/23/jon-husted/ohio-secretary-state-jon-husteds-tweets-about-clos/	Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted often cites the number of elections with razor-thin margins when talking about his responsibility to maintain accurate voter rolls. "When we say ‘one vote matters,’ it’s not just a saying – it has proven true 141 times in #Ohio over the last five years," Husted tweeted Jan. 3, linking to data about the 2017 elections. Husted has drawn national attention for the state’s longstanding policy of removing voters from the rolls who haven’t voted in recent years or confirmed their addresses, a policy challenged by the ACLU and other voting rights advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the policy later this year. A spokesman for Husted sent us data showing the 141 elections that resulted in a tie vote or a one-vote difference between 2013 and 2017. That data proves Husted’s point, but we will explain it in more detail. Husted is running for lieutenant governor in the May 8 Republican primary for governor; he is the running mate of Mike DeWine, the current attorney general who is running for governor. Republican incumbent Gov. John Kasich is term limited. Data on close elections in Ohio Husted’s data pertains to both local races for office as well as issue-oriented ballot questions. Issues and ballot questions require a majority vote in order to pass, so in the case of tie votes, the matter fails. In races determining local offices such as city council, in the case of tie votes, winners are determined by lot such as a coin toss or name draw. While the number of races that resulted in ties or were decided by one vote sounds like a lot in sheer numbers, it doesn’t add up to much when you consider that Ohio has a massive number of local elections in each cycle. In the November 2017 general election, there were 29 races that resulted in a tie or a one-vote difference. Statewide, there were about 1,500 local issues on topics such as a levy for cemeteries, road improvements, a fire contract and liquor laws. Some of these elections only drew hundreds of votes in various villages and townships. For example, a bond renewal in Charleston failed with a 41-41 tie. The Secretary of State’s office didn’t have the total number of all elections on the ballot, but in addition to the local issues, there were also local races for office and statewide issues. So while we don’t have data to calculate an exact percentage, it’s clear that the 29 races that Husted cited are only a fraction of a percentage of the total number of elections. Ohio State University assistant professor Vladimir Kogan, who studies state and local government, told PolitiFact that the one-vote threshold isn’t particularly meaningful or more important than other close races. Some people point to these close elections to justify voter ID laws, arguing that a single fraudulent vote could have decided an election, Kogan said. However, a single-vote election could just as well be decided by a voter ID law that keeps a single otherwise eligible voter from casting a ballot, he said. "In other words, close elections increase the importance both of policies that reduce fraud but also of the potential implications of those policies for turnout," he said. Husted has cited the one-vote races as part of the justification for maintaining accurate voter rolls. "When a single vote can have such a big impact in so many places, you can understand why we focus so heavily on accuracy of the voter rolls and the integrity of the elections process, and why we encourage every voter to take their right and responsibility to vote seriously," he said in 2013. He also cited the one-vote elections when he commented about his investigation that found 82 noncitizens who were alleged to have voted illegally in at least one election. "Every vote matters, and any illegal vote can have an effect," he said in 2017. Our ruling Husted tweeted "When we say ‘one vote matters,’ it’s not just a saying – it has proven true 141 times in #Ohio over the last five years." The tweet linked to a press release that said Husted was referring to races and local questions that resulted in tie votes or a difference of a single vote. Husted’s office provided data showing the 141 races for local office or local issue questions that were decided by that narrow margin between 2013 and 2017. Husted’s numbers are correct. However, we will note that races this close are very rare in the context of all the elections in Ohio. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10726	"America never made up for the gutting of the intelligence services that Bill Clinton did. I think those are (former CIA director George) Tenet's words ... that Bill Clinton gutted American intelligence."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/19/rudy-giuliani/hes-on-point-but-still-off-base/	Rudy Giuliani is basing his presidential campaign on the argument that, as the mayor who guided New York City through the Sept. 11 attacks, he's best suited to keep the country safe from terrorism. He has said repeatedly that he would continue President Bush's policy of attacking terrorists aggressively overseas, and has criticized the Clinton administration for failing to foresee the 9/11 attacks. "I think America — America never made up for the Clinton peace dividend; America never made up for the gutting of the intelligence services that Bill Clinton did," Giuliani said Nov. 2, 2007, on Bloomberg TV's Political Capital With Al Hunt. "I think those are Tenet's words, by the way, that Bill Clinton gutted American intelligence — 20, 30 percent cuts," Giuliani said, referring to former CIA director George Tenet, who has taken much of the heat for not foreseeing the 9/11 attacks. Given that his fellow front-runner, Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, was first lady during that time, Giuliani is eager to paint the most unflattering portrait he can of the Clinton administration's antiterrorism record. It is true that Clinton oversaw decreases in the intelligence budget and that Tenet has described the budget situation when he became CIA director in 1997, four years into Clinton's presidency, as a disaster. But Tenet has never placed blame on Clinton in the way Giuliani describes (which makes sense since Clinton made him director). Likewise, Giuliani neglects to provide some important context: The CIA budget cuts began under the first President Bush and were reversed, under Tenet's leadership, late in the Clinton presidency and before the 9/11 attacks. Here's what Tenet told the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States — better known as the 9/11 Commission — in April 2004 testimony: "By the mid 1990s the intelligence community was operating with a significant erosion in resources and people, and was unable to keep pace with technological change. When I became director of central intelligence, I found a community and a CIA whose dollars were declining and whose expertise was ebbing. We lost close to 25 percent of our people and billions of dollars in capital investment." As a result, Tenet said, the CIA no longer could "recruit, train and sustain officers for our clandestine services," and "the nation's human intelligence capability was in disarray." Tenet's clear implication is that Clinton — who took office in 1993 — bore considerable responsibility. But Tenet doesn't say whether Clinton accelerated the rate of decline or followed the trend begun by Bush, and proving it is impossible. That's because, with the exception of the current fiscal year and fiscal years 1997 and 1998 — when Tenet agreed to release the overall budget figure after the Federation of American Scientists filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit — the government has classified the intelligence budget on national security grounds. The budgets during the first two years of Clinton's presidency were lower than at any point during Bush's presidency, according to a chart released by Congress that shows spending growth and declines across years but not precise funding levels. The chart ends in fiscal 1994. The secrecy surrounding the budget during those years may have contributed to the precipitous cuts, as many advocates of increased military and intelligence spending were kept in the dark about them, argues Steven Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. In his view, the era was marked not by the "Clinton peace dividend" but the "post-Cold War peace dividend when defense spending and intelligence spending dropped significantly." Aftergood contends that the bottom hit in 1997, when Tenet became CIA director and made gaining new resources a top priority. The budgets for fiscal 1997 and 1998 were flat, according to the official figures Tenet released under pressure from the Federation of American Scientists: $26.6-billion in fiscal 1997, $26.7-billion in March 1998. In 1999, Tenet reversed course and refused to release the intelligence budgets for the remainder of his tenure, which ended in 2004. Aftergood suspects that the 1999 decision was made to mask the first big increase in intelligence spending since the Cold War ended. But it's impossible to be sure when the first budget increases came. Courts refused requests from the Federation of American Scientists to force Tenet to release the budgets. In his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Tenet said that he'd made considerable headway in boosting the agency's resources prior to the 9/11 attacks. "Between 1999 and 2001, our human agent base against the terrorist target grew by over 50 percent," he said. So, we conclude that Giuliani's statement is Half True. Clinton did reduce the intelligence budget early in his tenure. But Tenet never placed the blame squarely on Clinton's shoulders, as Giuliani said he did. And while Tenet said budget cuts had made it difficult for the CIA to pursue its mission by 1997, the cuts came during both the Bush and Clinton presidencies.

pomt-13618	That 59 divisions in Philly had no votes for Romney in 2012 is "(a) mathematical and statistical impossibility."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/12/viral-image/internet-philly-rigged-2012-presidential-election-/	Update 5:34 p.m. Okay. So, we’re still talking about this. There’s a meme circulating on the internet that promotes allegations of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida. Our kinsfolk over at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Florida have already reported on claims specific to their states. For Pennsylvania, the meme reads, "In 59 voting districts in the Philadelphia region, Obama received 100% of the votes, with not even a single vote recorded for Romney. (A mathematical and statistical impossibility.)" This kind of happened, and it’s not actually mathematically impossible. First, the 59 refers to the City of Philadelphia, not the metropolitan area or region. An absolutely crucial fact: The 59 zones that saw no votes for Romney were not districts, but divisions. There are nearly 1,700 divisions in Philadelphia. Each of the city’s 66 wards claims between 10 and 50 of them. To provide a sense of how small divisions are, currently, the average number of registered voters per division is 616. The division out of the 59 with the lowest turnout counted 139 votes in 2012; the highest was 612. As Billy Penn reported, after Sean Hannity reiterated that 59 divisions with all-Obama votes showed signs of election rigging, a West Philadelphia elections inspector took to Twitter to debunk it. The key nugget in his explanation was this: Votes cannot be subtracted from Philadelphia voting machines. Republican City Commissioner Al Schmidt confirmed that was indeed the case. So, if anyone had voted Romney, there’s no way that vote could’ve been removed from the tally, which means if fraud had occurred, it would’ve had to have happened before the vote button was pushed. Some of the 59 divisions had fewer than 10 registered Republicans, according to records from April 2012. The average number of registered Republicans in these divisions was 17. The Philadelphia Inquirer sought out many of these voters after the election, and found that the rolls could use some updating. Some, neighbors said, had moved, others straight-up told the Inquirer they didn’t know the city had them down as GOPers. One man told the paper while he was a Republican, he had never actually voted that way. Experts say these divisions reflect a trend of heavily Democratic inner-city neighborhoods. Considering how few Republicans live in these micro-neighborhoods, it’s not shocking that Romney would have a tough go of it against the nation’s first black president, in 59 subzones that only represented a mere 3.5 percent of the city’s vote in aggregate. Commissioner Al Schmidt told Billy Penn last week that in order for there to have been voter fraud, by adding votes in these divisions would have required "hundreds of people engaging in a conspiracy, and no one finding out about it." Our ruling A viral image has called 59 Philadelphia voter "districts" counting zero Romney votes in the 2012 general election "(a) mathematical and statistical impossibility." Only, these divisions were not the size of districts. They were much smaller, encompassing hundreds rather than thousands, and in predominately African-American areas of the city. Looking at the voter records from six months prior, Democrats in these areas outnumbered Republicans more than 20 to one. That’s before considering what the Inquirer’s reporting suggests: That out of the small minority of GOPers in these sections, many don’t align with the party, or don’t appear to live there anymore. Were the 59 divisions worthy of investigation? Yes. And that happened in 2012, and has happened numerous times since. We rule this claim a Pants on Fire. An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited PolitiFact Ohio. The reporting had been published by PolitiFact National.	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-08-12T14:07:43	2016-08-05	['None']
pomt-12355	"Seventy-seven of the top 300 cities with the highest poverty rate" nationwide are in California.	false	/california/statements/2017/jun/09/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosa-gets-it-wrong-california-poverty-figu/	When asked to list his top three priorities for California at a recent forum, Democratic candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa responded: "I think we’ve got to start with the economy, the economy, the economy." The former mayor of Los Angeles acknowledged strong economic growth "in some places," but made it clear that not all of California is "growing together." Villaraigosa went on to make an eye-opening claim about how many California cities rank among the poorest in the nation. "Seventy-seven of the top 300 cities with the highest poverty rate are in our state," Villaraigosa said at the forum, hosted on June 6, 2017 in San Francisco by the Public Policy Institute of California. Villaraigosa makes his claim at about the 6:45 minute mark in this video by the Public Policy Institute of California. We know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has "the highest poverty rate in the nation" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living. At 20.6 percent, California’s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. Florida’s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state, according to a 2014 analysis by Public Policy Institute of California. With this in mind, we decided to fact-check Villaraigosa’s assertion that California is also home to one-quarter of the nation’s poorest cities. Governor’s race Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player. PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in this race. See our "Tracking The Truth" governor’s race fact-checks here. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Our research Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman said his poverty claim draws on a 2015 report by the National Resource Network called Hidden in Plain Sight: Why California's Economically Challenged Cities Matter. The network was created by the Obama Administration to develop "innovative solutions to American cities to help them address their toughest economic challenges." Its study listed 77 "economically challenged" cities in California, ranging from big metros such as Los Angeles, Sacramento and Oakland to small ones like Lodi, Delano and Watsonville. It defines economically challenged as having at least one of the following characteristics: -- More than 9 percent of residents remained unemployed as of 2013 -- More than 20 percent of adults are living in poverty -- Population decline between 2000 and 2010 reached 5 percent Nationwide, it found nearly 300 such cities. California’s count equals about one-quarter of those. We wondered, however, whether cities listed as economically challenged (due at least partly to a 2013 jobless rate) could also be considered as currently having the "highest poverty rate," as Villaraigosa described them this week. Had Villaraigosa stretched the truth or perhaps conflated two separate descriptions of economic hardship? Staff at the National Resource Network, including the study’s lead author, did not immediately return requests for comment. Experts weigh in Ann Stevens director of the Center for Poverty Research and a professor of economics at the University of California at Davis, reviewed the study and Villaraigosa’s claim at our request His statement is "not accurate in terms of the poverty rate," Stevens told us. That’s because the study labeled many of these cities as economically challenged because of their 2013 jobless rate, "which is different than the poverty rate in 2013 or the poverty rate on average today." We found nearly half of the 77 cities described as economically challenged qualified for that label not because their poverty rate was above 20 percent, but because of their high jobless rate in 2013. In fact, the poverty level for at least some of these cities was closer to or below the national average. At that time, many cities in California were still struggling with high unemployment due to the Great Recession, Stevens added. But that’s a temporary measure of economic hardship, not a permanent one. Caroline Danielson, who researches poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California, said many of those cities are no longer struggling with unemployment. Los Angeles, for example, now has a jobless rate of 3.9 percent down from 9.7 percent in 2013, she said. Danielson said there’s no comparable ranking of every American city, large and small, by poverty rate. If there was, she said: "I don’t believe that California would be quite so overrepresented as we found in this report. That’s not to say that California has no high poverty cities." Along with pointing to the study, Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman said the candidate would still consider the 77 cities in the study "to be among those nationally with the highest poverty rate - certainly well above the average - and that is what makes them economically challenged." That’s not the same as Villaraigosa’s original statement that all 77 rank nationally among cities with "the highest poverty rate." Our ruling Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed: "Seventy-seven of the top 300 cities with the highest poverty rate are in our state." He relied on a study that grouped 77 "economically challenged" cities in California among nearly 300 such cities in the nation. But it used data from four years ago, when many cities were still recovering from the Great Recession. Villaraigosa made it sound as if these cities are still experiencing the same level of hardship. Also, experts on poverty said the economically challenged label isn’t the same as Villaraigosa’s description of these cities as among the poorest in the nation. Nearly half the cities on the study’s list qualified for that label not because of their poverty level. Many, in fact, had poverty rates below the state average. Instead, they qualified because they had a high unemployment rate in 2013. The jobless rate in many of those cities has improved considerably since then. Villaraigosa touched on a real problem in California: Poverty remains widespread and entrenched. But he mischaracterized the results of a study and painted a darker picture of economic hardship in California than the facts bear out. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim False.

pomt-13441	"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/16/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-hillary-clinton-/	Donald Trump repeated his debunked claim that Hillary Clinton started the rumors questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. "Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy," Trump said in a 30-minute press conference Sept. 16, 2016. "I finished it." The birther issue reemerged when the Washington Post asked Trump a day earlier if he believes Obama was born in the United States. He refused to answer. "I’ll answer the question at the right time," Trump said Sept. 15. "I just don’t want to answer it yet." This prompted a flurry of incredulity over his revitalization of the "birther" issue, which in turn prompted his campaign to answer the question for him and also accuse Clinton of starting it in the first place. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Clinton began the whole issue in the first place. Trump said "Hillary is a birther" in February 2015 at CPAC, tweeted that "she was all in" in September 2015, and said "she brought it up years before it was brought up by me" on CNN in May 2016. The morning of his press conference, Trump brought it up again on Fox Business. PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact-Checker have debunked this zombie claim multiple times. There is no evidence that Clinton or her 2008 campaign ever floated the theory. While Clinton supporters circulated the allegations the last time she ran for president, they had no ties to either the candidate or her staff. A damning memo? The Sept. 15 Trump campaign statement linked to a 2007 strategy memo published in the Atlantic from former Clinton aide Mark Penn that advises pointing out Obama’s "lack of American roots." While Penn suggests Clinton "own ‘American’ in our programs," that’s not the same thing as suggesting Clinton question Obama’s citizenship or birthplace. The memo never advises that. It also explicitly states, "We are never going to say anything about his background." Furthermore, as the Atlantic and Politico reported in 2008, neither Clinton nor her campaign acted on Penn’s advice. A not-damning chain email The other piece of "evidence" linking Clinton to birtherism are emails circulated by supporters of Clinton during the last days of the 2008 Democratic primary after Clinton suspended her campaign. According to a Telegraph article, Clinton supporters circulated the "birther" theory in an email as early as April 2008. "Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy," the email said, according to the Telegraph. "She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth." The allegations gained momentum that month. Clinton conceded the race on June 7, and three days later a website called Pumaparty.com (an acroynom for Party Unity My A--) encouraged Clinton backers to support Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. The website promoted the theory with an email that read, "Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President," as Daily Beast editor John Avlon has documented. According to Avlon, Linda Starr, a Clinton volunteer in Texas, was key to spreading the rumor. She connected with with Philip Berger, an attorney and Clinton supporter, who sued to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out. But this is not the same thing as Clinton or her campaign promoting the theory. There is no evidence that they ever have done so. Clinton has dismissed the allegation when Trump made his accusation last September in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. "That is — no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that," Clinton said. "You know, I have been blamed for nearly everything, that was a new one to me." (Another thing to note: Clinton volunteers forwarded emails promoting the myth that Obama is a Muslim. As we have previously reported, both resigned from the campaign after they were found to have spread the rumor. The Clinton campaign condemned their actions and said it was unauthorized.) Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy." There is no evidence to support this. Clinton supporters circulated the rumor in the last days of the 2008 Democratic primary and after Clinton had conceded to Obama. But the record does not show Clinton or her campaign ever promoting the birther theory, let alone starting it. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-14249	Says a company that got tax breaks from the state later "laid off 100 Ohioans, even as its CEO cut a half-million-dollar check to Kasich’s super PAC."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/12/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-ad-revisits-controversy-kasichs-governors/	Presidential candidate Ted Cruz’s campaign came out swinging directly at rival John Kasich for the first time in a TV ad. The attack ads are getting more direct, as the delegates in contention dwindle. This ad presents a series of facts to suggest that Kasich, as governor of Ohio, orchestrated shady deals to benefit his friends and campaign funders. "Right before John Kasich was governor, he collected $611,000 from a Fortune 500 corporation," the ad says. "After Kasich became governor, that same company received $619 grand in state tax breaks for job creation. But last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans, even as its CEO cut a half-million-dollar check to Kasich’s super PAC. John Kasich, not for us." To find out whether it’s fact or fiction, let’s take each allegation one at a time. Kasich took money from a Fortune 500 company According to news reports, in 2001 after leaving Congress, Kasich joined the board of directors of Worthington Industries, an Ohio steel processor and Fortune 500 company. Security and Exchange Commission filings show that Worthington board members were paid $45,000 per year as a retainer, and $1,500 per meeting attended. Worthington also reimbursed board members for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs. The Canton Repository reported that Kasich quit the Worthington board upon winning the governor’s race in 2010, but was still owed deferred compensation from the board. Kasich received $611,000 total in deferred compensation from Worthington, and at least $103,000 of the total came after he had been sworn in as governor. That same company received $619,000 in tax breaks after Kasich took office In the first bill he signed as governor, Kasich made good on a campaign promise to attract investment to Ohio. He nixed the Ohio Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation called JobsOhio, explaining that in order to lure companies to the state, government needed to "move at the speed of business." Kasich designed JobsOhio to be funded by a lease on state liquor profits. He declared it exempt from public records requirements and state audits. And he made board appointments for JobsOhio a responsibility of the governor. To drum up job creation, JobsOhio reviews potential opportunities to offer incentives such as tax breaks, and sends its recommendations to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for final determination. The tax credit authority has a five-member board, and three of its appointees, including the chair, are Kasich’s. An Associated Press investigation found that, less than a year after JobsOhio was created, it recommended a series of tax incentives totalling $619,000 for Worthington Industries’ subsidiaries, which the state tax credit board awarded. Last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans In March 2015, Worthington announced it was cutting 555 jobs nationwide, which included 115 in Ohio. The company blamed the loss of these jobs --manufacturing cabs for large agricultural and mining equipment -- on industry-wide downturns. Worthington spokeswoman Cathy Lyttle told the Canton Repository that any incentives the company receives are only paid when the company delivers the jobs it promised. She said that pursuing tax incentives is standard business practice, and Worthington received $400,000 in tax breaks under the previous, Democratic regime of governor Ted Strickland. Company’s CEO donates half-million to Kasich’s presidential bid The Center for Responsive Politics confirms a $500,000 contribution from Worthington CEO John P. McConnell to the New Day 2016 PAC, via Internal Revenue Service records released November 30, 2015. Several of Kasich's board appointees stepped up with campaign donations as well. OpenSecrets.org shows that the wife of ethics committee chairman Merom Brachman, Judith, gave the maximum donation to Kasich’s campaign, $2,700, in August 2015. John C. Boland, the chair of JobsOhio, donated the $2,700 max to Kasich in July 2015. JobsOhio board member Gary R. Heminger and his wife, Jane, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in October 2015. JobsOhio board member Lawrence J. Kidd and his wife, Cindy, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in August 2015. All together now Cruz’s attack ad parrots a complaint filed with the Ohio Ethics Commission by Kasich’s Democratic challenger in the 2014 election, Ed FitzGerald. The ethics commission passed on investigating FitzGerald’s complaint. Chairman Brachman, who, like the other commissioners, was appointed by the governor, said that Kasich had provided enough information to conclusively rule out any conflict of interest. He added that actions by JobsOhio are not subject to the authority of the ethics commission. Rob Nichols, Kasich’s spokesman, dismissed this Cruz ad as a "one-hit wonder" that only ran briefly in Wisconsin and is no longer airing. The ad’s "four accurate, provable data points," aren’t in dispute, Nichols said. But he has a beef with the insinuation that any of the described actions were wrong, or even out of the ordinary. "They didn’t say, ‘The governor’s corrupt,’ because that you could fact-check," Nichols said. "Everything there is 100 percent, entirely above-board, but when you say it with a snarly voice over scary music, people think it’s inappropriate." Our ruling Cruz’s attack ad links a series of headlines to suggest that as governor, Kasich rewarded his former business ties in exchange for political contributions. The ad’s tone is ominous, but the text is factual. What isn’t explained is that everything in the ad has been the subject of prior complaints that did not provoke any regulatory action. It’s been suggested that an overhaul of state rules might prevent similar situations from arising, and similar allegations from dogging Ohio leaders. But that’s a different ad, for another day. We rate these claims Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5c230c3d-e90e-48ec-854d-8dc94efa2c1a	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-04-12T10:27:10	2016-04-03	['Ohio', 'John_Kasich']
pomt-03596	Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost every U.S. family $45,000.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/13/cokie-roberts/roberts-lays-out-financial-costs-modern-wars/	President Barack Obama is doing his best to fend off characterization as a "lame-duck" leader, a moniker that typically plagues term-limited elected officials. In his case, Obama has implied that it’s the unyielding Republicans refusing to compromise on issues like gun control and undoing sequestration cuts that prevent him from furthering his agenda. Political pundits took up the issue again this month on the ABC television news program "This Week With George Stephanopoulos." The roundtable panel debated whether the president can get anything done. "With the public being so completely disillusioned with American wars abroad that have gone on for so long … these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have cost every American family something like $45,000, not to mention, of course, the lives," said ABC and NPR political contributor Cokie Roberts. "It really takes the whole foreign policy option off the table when Americans say they don’t want to have our troops engaged in another war." Since the beginning of the wars, there has been no shortage of claims about the financial costs to the average American, American families and even Americans who haven’t been born yet. Roberts’ figure was the latest we’d heard, so PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Roberts told PolitiFact Georgia that she got her figure within the past two weeks directly from Zbigniew Brzezinski, former President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. In the past, wars were financed by war bonds or by raising taxes. Current wars have been funded almost entirely by borrowing, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Cost of War Project housed at Brown University. We found various sources that have studied war costs. Some factor in future benefit costs and debt repayment; others include only funds that have been spent and approved by Congress. Two recent studies, both published this year, estimate the cost of the two wars has reached $4 trillion. The first, published in March by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes, found that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts will be the most expensive wars in U.S. history, totaling between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Along with traditional war costs such as weapons and equipment, Bilmes’ study included long-term medical and disability costs for service members and their families. The second study, by the Cost of War Project, lists current spending, including interest paid on war debt, through fiscal 2013 at $3.1 trillion. Add in future veterans’ obligations, and the amount reaches about $4 trillion. The amount could rise much higher based on future interest payments. Census data reports almost 115 million households existed in the country from 2007-2011, according to the most recent data. At $4 trillion, each of the 115 million households would be responsible for just under $35,000 of the war costs. At $6 trillion, the household responsibility would rise to around $52,000. Roberts’ claim initially seemed a bit high, but is in the range of estimates based on the most recent studies, said Christopher A. Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "I think it’s essential to give a full picture of costs (including debt service and future veterans’ benefits and expenses)," Preble said. "Don’t assume the cost of war ends when the shooting stops." Other studies don’t factor in these long-term costs. The National Priorities Project operates the Cost of War website, which keeps a running total of the costs for both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This past week, the constantly increasing total had reached over $1.4 trillion. Based on that figure, each of the country’s households would be responsible for around $12,300 in war costs thus far. Data from the Congressional Budget Office also shows that about $1.4 trillion has been approved for the wars, including some funds for veterans’ benefits and services. National Priorities, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the federal budget, includes only funds that have been appropriated by the government that can be found in appropriations documents. The site makes no attempt to project future costs, such as veterans’ benefits and medical costs. "There are a lot of people who think that is a component," said Chris Hellman, a senior research analyst with National Priorities. "We acknowledge that this is a growing edge of what our nation’s commitment is, but we look only at the narrowly construed combat operations and related support costs of the wars." A website feature provides the amount of the $1.4 trillion that taxpayers in each state, county and major city have paid toward the wars, and also provides a list of services that could have been provided for the same amount of money. (For example, Georgia taxpayers have contributed $35.6 billion, which could have also funded 721,000 police officers, or 4.8 million Head Start slots, or 4.7 million college scholarships, etc., for one year.) So, do Roberts’ numbers add up? Her claim that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have cost each U.S. household $45,000 would mean that war spending -- including future veterans’ benefits and debt service costs -- would have to be about $5.2 trillion. The most recent studies that include these long-term costs report war spending between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Studies that do not include the long-term costs list war costs at $1.4 trillion thus far in funds that have been approved by Congress. Assuming Roberts’ claim factored in future expenses, her claim would fall in the appropriate range of estimated spending. But leave those out, and she comes up short. Her claim is partially accurate, but needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate Roberts’ claim Half True.

pomt-02765	"60 percent of people on food assistance are working."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/11/barbara-lee/barbara-lee-says-60-percent-people-food-assistance/	Following President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the economy, CNN’s Crossfire roundtable debated how to shrink the income gap. Talk centered mostly on the minimum wage. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., told host Newt Gingrich she supports a raise to $10 an hour so that people can support themselves and their families. "First of all, $7.25 an hour. Can anyone live off that?" Lee said. "Secondly, I just have to say, 60 percent of people on food assistance are working. They're part of the working poor." We wanted to take a closer look at what percentage of people receiving food stamps (also known as SNAP, for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) are working. Lee’s spokeswoman pointed us to a January 2013 report on the relationship between SNAP and employment put out by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit liberal think tank. Finding the right data The report analyzes food stamp data from two different sources: SNAP Quality Control Household Statistics and the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation. Lee’s 60 percent figure comes from the census survey. That’s data the census obtained by calling households. They assessed the work rate of individuals from households receiving food stamps in a typical month and the year before and after. The survey is longitudinal, so it’s designed to show how the work rate changes over time in these same families. The SNAP data set, on the other hand, isn’t longitudinal. It’s information collected by the Department of Agriculture, and it’s meant to show a snapshot of what the work rate looks like at a single point in time. The data includes a sample of families from each state, but it’s not the same families included every time. Both data sets highlighted in the report are from 2005, so the author could use an apples-to-apples comparison. If the SNAP data isn’t longitudinal, why not just use the Census survey to show what’s happened to the work rate over time? Dorothy Rosenbaum, the author of the report, said the SNAP data is more reliable and more recent. So what’s the right percentage? Lee’s 60 percent doesn’t refer to the entire population of food stamp recipients. Rather, it refers to the subset of recipients who are "expected" to work -- that excludes children, the elderly and the disabled. That distinction makes sense, since including the groups that never work wouldn’t be a reliable way to track the change in the work rate. Let’s compare what the SNAP and Census data show about the percentage of people on food stamps who work (out of those expected to), but let’s keep in mind that this data is pre-recession: 43 percent, SNAP numbers indicate. 58 percent, Census numbers indicate. In a report footnote, Rosenbaum averaged the two statistics and said that, as of 2005, half of all food stamp recipients expected to work were working. The average is close to what Lee mentioned, but she selected the higher of the two numbers available. We’ve also got 2011 numbers that weren’t officially released by the Census or SNAP: 42 percent for SNAP and 56 percent for the Census, Rosenbaum said, based on public use data she accessed. So by both accounts, things haven’t changed much since the year Lee took her data from. Although all this data excludes those with disabilities, people with disabilities who don’t receive benefits from programs like Veterans Affairs, Social Security or Supplemental Security Income are still in the category of those expected to work. If all adults with disabilities were moved to the proper category of the data, the work rate percentage would shoot up to a more accurate value. Our ruling Lee said 60 percent of people receiving food stamps are working. She should’ve specified that she meant 60 percent of the pool of recipients expected to work. Her figure’s a little high, but anywhere from about 42 to 58 percent is a reasonable summary of the report’s findings and more recent data available. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-01728	President Barack Obama’s latest executive order "mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of ‘respiratory illness.’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/06/blog-posting/website-obama-mandated-detention-people-respirator/	The arrival of two Americans infected with the Ebola virus at an Atlanta hospital has ginned up the fear mill and the conspiracy website Infowars.com has fused fear of infection with fear of Big Brother. When the first American was admitted to Emory University Hospital’s special infectious disease treatment center, Infowars.com wrote, "United States officials brought an affected (sic) patient into the country only days after President (Barack) Obama signed an executive order mandating the detention of Americans who show signs of ‘respiratory illness’." At another point, the article says Obama’s latest executive order "mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of 'respiratory illness.' " The article correctly reports that President Barack Obama signed an executive order on July 31, but beyond that, the accuracy quotient falls rapidly. As for the Ebola patients, government officials did not bring them back to America, as Infowars said. While the State Department facilitated the paperwork for the medical evacuations, these people arrived in a private chartered jet paid for by the religious charities they worked for, Serving in Mission and Samaritan’s Purse. At a news conference, Bruce Johnson, the president of Serving in Mission USA, said his group has spent about $1 million on the two patients since their illness was discovered. Second, and more important for this fact-check, is what the executive order says. It's much more targeted than the article describes, it isn’t aimed at Ebola, and while it allows health officials to quarantine someone with a highly contagious disease, it does not mandate it. On July 31, Obama modified a 2003 executive order from President George W. Bush. The original listed the communicable diseases for which the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to issue an isolation or quarantine order. Bush specifically mentioned Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease associated with "fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness." Obama updated the particular reference to SARS to include a broader array of possible respiratory illnesses. The new text reads as follows: "Severe acute respiratory syndromes, which are diseases that are associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person, and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled. This subsection does not apply to influenza." To be clear, the update has nothing to do with Ebola or the current outbreak. Ebola is not a respiratory disease (the most prominent signs are diarrhea and vomiting) and the original 2003 executive order already listed Ebola. The White House press office told PunditFact that the change was aimed at Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), an illness with symptoms that do match the updated executive order. More critically for our examination, the updated order does not "mandate" the apprehension and detention of people who show signs of respiratory illness. Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University School of Law, is one of three legal scholars who prepared a report for the American Civil Liberties Union that warned about overreach by the government in responding to pandemics. While Parmet said the new text is very broad, it has clear limits. "It only applies to those with symptoms of a disease that have caused or have the potential to cause a pandemic, or have the potential of causing mortality or serious morbidity," Parmet said. "I wouldn’t think the typical cold would apply." In fact, the order specifically excludes the flu. What happens if you do have Ebola, or MERS, or one of the other afflictions specified in the executive order? Title 42 United States Code Section 264 gives the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to isolate an infected person. The department must determine that a person presents a risk to public health. Its authority is limited to people as they enter the country or attempt to travel from one one state to another. In other scenarios, the power to isolate or quarantine individuals rests with the states, Parmet said. Our ruling Infowars.com said Obama’s latest executive order "mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of ‘respiratory illness.’" That’s a fundamental misreading of the executive order Obama signed and the power the federal government has. The updates Obama made to a 2003 executive order do not mandate the apprehension and detention of people who show signs of "respiratory illness," has nothing to do with the current Ebola crisis and only affect people entering the country or crossing state lines.

pomt-03610	Among Hispanics, support for immigration reform is close to universal.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/09/bill-richardson/bill-richardson-says-hispanic-support-immigration-/	Former Democratic cabinet member and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson caused a bit of a kerfuffle recently when he knocked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for Cruz’s skepticism about immigration legislation that’s pending in Congress. During a web interview with ABC News, host Benjamin Bell asked Richardson, "Do you think he represents most Hispanics with his politics?" "No," Richardson responded, "He’s anti-immigration. Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don’t think he should be defined as a Hispanic. He's a politician from Texas, a conservative state." Critics later took Richardson to task for seeming to judge whether another politician was "Hispanic" enough, and the former governor proceeded to clarify in a Fox News interview that while he and Cruz disagree on immigration, "all I was saying is I don’t consider myself just a Hispanic and he shouldn’t be defined just as a Hispanic. We’re other things. That’s what I said." We won’t wade into the question of what Richardson meant when he described Cruz, but we did think it was worth looking at whether the evidence supports Richardson’s claim that "almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform." We decided to take a look at the available poll data to determine whether Hispanic support for immigration reform is anywhere close to universal. Finding poll data that speaks to this question is actually trickier than one might imagine. A typical national poll -- even one from a major survey firm -- usually doesn’t have enough Hispanic respondents to produce reliable results. So we had to look at polls that are targeted at Hispanic voters, which are much less common. Frequently, these Hispanic-focused polls ask questions in both Spanish and English, which adds to their reliability. We’ll also note that Richardson used the term "immigration reform," which has any number of definitions. For this analysis, we will focus on the immigration policies that would allow a path to citizenship or other benefits to illegal immigrants, since those are the highest-profile and in many cases most controversial aspects of immigration proposals currently being discussed. We found nine relevant questions over the past few years that polled Hispanics: • Pew Research Center, February 2013: "What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration? Better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws, or creating a way for illegal immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements?" Among Hispanics, 49 percent said both should be equal priorities and 41 percent said creating a path to citizenship should be the priority, for a combined score of 90 percent supporting a path to citizenship. Eight percent said border security should be the priority. The poll surveyed 149 Hispanics, for a 9 percentage-point margin of error. • Pew Research Center, March 2013. "Should illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in the country legally or not? If yes, should they be granted citizenship or permanent residency?" Among Hispanics, 80 percent said they should be able to stay legally, of which 49 percent opted for citizenship and 26 percent favored permanent residency. Seventeen percent said they should not be allowed to stay legally. The poll surveyed 155 Hispanics, with a roughly 9 percentage-point margin of error. • Pew Hispanic Center, October 2012. "Do you approve of President Obama’s program for unauthorized immigrants brought as children?" (This policy offers relief from deportation for unauthorized immigrants younger than 30 who were brought into the country as children and who are currently enrolled in school or have obtained a high school diploma or GED.) Among Hispanics, 89 percent approved of the policy, compared to 9 percent who disapproved. The poll surveyed 1,765 Latinos with a 3 percentage point margin of error. • Pew Hispanic Center, October 2012. "Thinking about immigrants who are living in the United States illegally, do you favor or oppose providing a way for illegal immigrants currently in the country to gain legal citizenship if they pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs?" Among Hispanics, 86 percent favored the policy as stated, while 8 percent opposed it. The poll surveyed 1,375 Latinos for a 3 percentage point margin of error. • Public Religion Research Institute-Brookings Institution, March 2013. "Should the immigration system allow immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements?" Among Hispanic Catholics,74 percent supported the policy, as did 71 percent of Hispanic Protestants. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. • Public Religion Research Institute-Brookings Institution, March 2013. "Do you favor allowing illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal resident status if they join the military or go to college?" (This is a core part of the DREAM Act.) Among Hispanic Catholics, 83 percent expressed support, while 68 percent of Hispanic Protestants did. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. • Latino Decisions-National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials-America’s Voice Education Fund, April 2013. "I want to ask you some questions about your views should immigration reform be passed this year. Suppose the law also allowed you to eventually become a United States citizen. Would you become a citizen or not?" Alone among the polls listed here, this is the only one to specifically pose its question to undocumented immigrants. It found that 87 percent of undocumented immigrants would apply for citizenship, a tacit indication that they approve of the policy. The poll surveyed 400 undocumented immigrants, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. • Univision-Latino Decisions, November 2011. "Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?" Among Hispanics, 83 percent supported the policy either strongly or somewhat, compared to 11 percent who opposed it either strongly or somewhat. The poll surveyed 1,000 Latinos for a margin of error of 3 percentage points. • Latino Consortium-Latino Decisions, March 2013. "Congress is considering many different ideas to include in a new immigration reform law. … Which would you support more? The plan that would provide a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, so long as they meet certain requirements, or the plan that would give them probationary status until the border is declared fully secure, and then they could start to apply for citizenship?" Among Hispanics, 70 percent supported a clear pathway to citizenship, while 25 percent favored waiting until the border is secure. Poll surveyed 800 Latinos, for a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. Our ruling The polls that surveyed enough Hispanic voters to be reliable showed strong and consistent majority support for a variety of policies that might be characterized as "immigration reform." In some cases, the level of support reached 90 percent. However, saying, as Richardson did, that "almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform," overlooks the 8 percent to 25 percent of Hispanics who, depending on how the question is asked, expressed reservations about or opposition to those policies. The level of dissent among Hispanics is small, but it's not as infinitesimal as Richardson’s comment suggests. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-09946	"The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/29/north-korea/north-korea-contends-five-permanent-members-un-sec/	Facing international condemnation for a recent underground nuclear weapon test, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a statement accusing the United Nations Security Council of hypocrisy. "There is a limit to our patience," its Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried on the official Korean Central News Agency. "The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests." As a matter of policy, PolitiFact does not take totalitarian dictatorships at their word. Beyond that, we were simply curious which countries have done nuclear weapons testing, and how much. So we decided to check this claim. According to a report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, there have been 2,051 nuclear tests worldwide since 1945 done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: U.S. - 1,030 Russia/U.S.S.R - 715 U.K. - 45 France - 210 China - 45 There have been only a handful of other tests, although there are doubts about the exact number. In 1974, India tested a nuclear device, although it produced a relatively small explosive yield. India claimed to have detonated five more nuclear devices in May 1998. In response to the Indian tests, Pakistan announced that it had exploded five nuclear devices a couple weeks later. It has been widely speculated that India and Pakistan exaggerated the number and size of the explosions for political reasons. Nonetheless, that's the number of announced nuclear tests. Since then, North Korea is the only country to perform an announced test. Its first came in 2006. And then on May 26, 2009, North Korea announced that it had successfully conducted its second underground nuclear test, in defiance of international warnings. (There has also been some speculation that Israel may have conducted a test in 1979, but those claims have never been substantiated.) So arguably, there have been as many as 13 nuclear tests conducted by countries other than the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said Carey Sublette, creator of the Nuclear Weapon Archive, which tracks nuclear testing via public records. By Sublette's count, there have been a total of 2,054 nuclear tests. That means 99.37 percent of all the tests were done by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, he said. "It's about right," Sublette said of the figures cited by North Korea. "If it's off, it's only off by a few (tests)." We aren't inclined to quibble with fractions of one percent. We find North Korea's claim to be True.

pomt-06198	While CEOs of some large charities have big salaries, the heads of some veterans groups do the job for free.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/11/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-top-executives-veterans-organi/	If this is the time of year when you open your checkbook to make donations to worthy causes, an anonymous e-mail making the rounds has some suggestions for you. It lists nine organizations and the compensation each top officer received. The CEO of UNICEF, the fund to help children around the world, is listed as having the largest salary: $1.2 million per year, plus a Rolls Royce, plus expenses, for an organization the e-mail claims spends "less than 5 cents of your donated dollar" on its mission. The heads of other charitable organizations are listed as having sizable salaries as well. By contrast, the e-mail lists five veterans groups and says the national commander of each "receives a $0.00 zero salary." (You can see the text of the e-mail on various websites, including here and here.) The author of the e-mail says, "No further comment is necessary." But we wanted to be sure. A shorter version of this e-mail, which doesn't mention the veterans groups, has been around for a while. Our friends at Snopes.com ruled that it was "mostly outdated and inaccurate." We decided to examine the longer list of groups using data from GuideStar.org, which has the latest IRS 990 forms listing total compensation for highest-paid workers and from the Better Business Bureau's website, which also analyzes charities. Remember, the heads of all these groups are supposedly working for free. AMERICAN LEGION: The group's national adjutant, Daniel S. Wheeler earned $201,661 in salary and other compensation, according to the organization's 990 form from 2009. Unlike the other organizations we examined, the Legion failed to fill out the form breaking down how much it spent on fundraising and administrative costs. But the Better Business Bureau, in its analysis released in February 2010, found that, of the $63 million it spent, 45 cents out of every dollar went for fundraising and administrative costs. The organization failed to meet 11 of the Better Business Bureau's 20 standards of accountability. DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS: National Adjutant and CEO Arthur H. Wilson earned $328,252 in compensation, according to the organization's 990 report for 2009. Of the $124 million in expenses, 30 cents of every dollar was spent on fundraising and administrative costs. The organization met all of the BBB's standards for charity accountability. VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES: VFW Adjutant General Allen F. Kent earned $215,822, according to the organization's 990 report from 2009. The organization's quartermaster general earned nearly $24,000 more than Kent in compensation. Three other top officials also earned more than $211,000. With nearly $85 million in expenses, 36 cents of each dollar was spent on administration and fundraising. The Better Business Bureau could not rate this organization because it failed to release enough information to the BBB. MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART SERVICE FOUNDATION (listed in the e-mail as The Military Order of Purple Hearts): Executive Director Gregory Bresser received $142,986 in compensation in 2009, and that was only for part of the year. He left the post in August. CFO Stephen Ruckman got $150,626, according to the 990 filing for 2009. The group listed nearly $34 million in expenses and spent a whopping 63 cents per dollar on fundraising and administrative costs. The BBB could not rate this organization either because it did not supply enough information. VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA (The e-mail listed the Vietnam Veterans Association, which we couldn’t find. This organization was the closest match.): Chief financial officer and staff director Joseph Sternburg earned $137,902 in compensation, according to its 990 report from 2009. According to the form, the organization has $7 million in expenses and spent 33 cents per dollar on fundraising and administration. When the BBB reviewed the organization, in March of 2010, the rate was 75 cents per dollar -- the highest rate we saw. The business bureau said the group failed to meet 10 of the 20 standards of accountability. We also checked the other organizations that the e-mail was comparing the veterans organizations to. AMERICAN RED CROSS: The e-mail says the CEO makes $651,957, which actually is an understatement. President and CEO Gail McGovern earned more than $1 million in compensation, according to the organization's 990 form for 2009, which says she typically worked 60 hours per week. The charity spent $3.4 billion; fundraising and administrative costs ate up just 8 cents of every dollar. The latest BBB rating says the organization met all of its accountability standards. UNITED WAY WORLDWIDE: The e-mail says President and CEO Brian A. Gallagher makes $375,000, but the organization's financial report says he made $717,076 in income and other compensation for 2009. (Its chief operating officer earned the most: $864,875.) Fundraising and administrative costs accounted for 11 cents of every dollar spent. The BBB says the charity met all 20 of its standards of accountability. (Anthony Maione, CEO of United Way of Rhode Island, received $211,378 in compensation, according to the organization's 2009 report.) THE SALVATION ARMY is not required to report complete 990 financial data because it is largely a religious organization. One quarter of the money raised by the four Salvation Armies that cover different sectors of the United States goes to the national office, which supplied data to the BBB to get its certification, according to Salvation Army spokesman Maj. George Hood. National Commander William A. Roberts receives $126,920 in compensation (not $13,000 per year plus housing as the e-mail reports). That salary is shared with his wife, who also works for the organization. The organization logged $51 million in expenses; 15 cents per dollar went for fundraising and administrative costs. (Total expenses for all of its affiliate organizations was $3.2 billion, with 18 percent going for fundraising and administrative costs.) UNITED STATES FUND FOR UNICEF: The e-mail says CEO Carly M. Stern's compensation is $1.2 million. It was actually $472,891, according to its 2009 report. The e-mail says only 5 cents of every dollar "goes to the cause;" it's really 83 cents. The amount spent on fundraising and administrative costs: 17 cents per dollar, out of a budget of $243 million. The BBB says the charity met all 20 of its standards of accountability. Our ruling To be charitable, the only thing this e-mail got right was the names of some of the top officers. Everything else was wildly off. Here's the summary: Organization Top compensation Fundraising and administration costs E-mail says Actual E-mail says Actual American Legion $0 $206,661 -- 45% Disabled American Veterans $0 $328,252 -- 30% Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. $0 $239,534 -- 36% Military Order of the Purple Heart $0 $150,626 -- 63% Vietnam Veterans of America $0 $137,902 -- 33% American Red Cross $651,957 $1,032,022 -- 8% United Way Worldwide $375,000 $864,875 -- 11% Salvation Army $13,000+ $126,920 4% 15% U.S. Fund for UNICEF $1.2 million $472,891 over 95% 17% First, the suggestion made in the e-mail that top officials in five veterans groups are working for free turns out to be outlandishly false. All are making six-figure incomes. Top officials in three of the non-veteran organizations earn a lot more than stated in the e-mail. In one case, they make a lot less. The e-mail incorrectly states -- in the case of UNICEF, wildly misstates -- the amount the charities spend on charitable work.

pomt-04453	A member of the redistricting commission proposed in Issue 2 "could accept a bribe from somebody" and "couldn’t be removed from this commission."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/11/jon-husted/jon-husted-claims-member-proposed-redistricting-co/	Republican opponents of Issue 2, the proposed redistricting reform plan, have started to question the rules that would govern the new citizens committee that would handle redistricting should voters approve the measure on Nov. 6. Secretary of State Jon Husted underscored these concerns when he recently described to reporters a startling hypothetical situation involving a commission member. "Apparently, you could accept a bribe from somebody to get the map that you want, and you couldn’t be removed from this commission," Husted, a Republican and outspoken critic of Issue 2, told reporters after the Aug. 15 meeting of the Ohio Ballot Board to determine ballot language for Issue 2. Is Husted right? Issue 2, after all, is billed as an attempt to remove political influence from the redistricting process. PolitiFact Ohio checked into Husted’s statement. First, some background about the current system and what Issue 2 would do if approved by voters on Nov. 6: In Ohio now, elected officials control redistricting. Every 10 years, after the census, the governor, legislative leaders and others approve maps with new boundaries for Congressional and legislative districts. Historically, the process has been ultra-partisan, with the party in power drawing district lines that group voters in ways to ensure electoral success. Issue 2 would establish a 12-member commission of Democrats, Republicans and independents or third-party members to draw the lines. The commission would have to approve maps with districts that emphasize compactness, community preservation, competitiveness and that reflect how Ohioans have voted. The proposal also includes criteria for serving on the commission. State and federal elected officials, their family members, lobbyists, well-heeled donors and others are banned. Proponents of Issue 2 have labeled the panel a "citizens commission," but the proposal does not prohibit mayors or other local elected officials from serving. To insulate the commission from political influence, the proposed constitutional amendment states that "no member of the commission shall be subject to removal by the General Assembly or any member of the executive branch." So, how would a commission member be removed for bribery? We checked with Husted’s office for evidence to support his claim. A spokesman directed us to view an online video of the ballot board meeting showing an exchange between Husted and Don McTigue, a lawyer for Voters First Ohio, the union-back group that supports Issue 2. Husted and McTigue debated how a commission member would be removed. "You don’t see any authority that is in this amendment that allows them (the commission) to remove somebody?" Husted asked. "Correct," McTigue answered. Husted spokesman Matt McClellan said it is clear that Issue 2 does not give the commission any power to remove a commission member engaged in questionable activity such as bribery. But that’s not what Husted said. He said a commission member could not be removed at all. And McTigue later said there are other ways already in place to remove a commission member. Ohio’s bribery statute says that a public official convicted of bribery is "forever disqualified from holding any public office, employment, or position of trust in this state." An official convicted of bribery most likely would be removed from office by a judge during sentencing, McTigue said in an interview. But if not, Ohio law allows a county prosecutor to file a quo warranto action to remove an official unlawfully holding an office. When we presented to Husted’s office the provisions of the bribery statute that would apply to a commission member convicted of bribery, his spokesman said Husted’s point was that Issue 2 lacks a process to remove a commission member. Another supporter of Issue 2 said there are other ways to handle a situation in which a commission member took a bribe. Daniel Tokaji, an Ohio State University law professor who helped draft Issue 2, however, said that existing Ohio law, enacted under Article 2, Section 38 of the Ohio Constitution, sets a process for removing an officeholder. That section of the constitution says "laws shall be passed providing for the prompt removal from office, upon complaint and hearing, of all officers, including state officers, judges and members of the general assembly, for any misconduct involving moral turpitude or for other cause provided by law; and this method of removal shall be in addition to impeachment or other method of removal authorized by the constitution." Under that portion of the constitution, lawmakers enacted Ohio Revised Code sections 3.07 through 3.10, which lay out a judicial process for removal of officeholders in cases of "gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, drunkenness, misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance." Tokaji said bribery would fall under gross immorality. "A commissioner could therefore be removed for bribery following this statutory process," Tokaji said in an e-mail. "Nothing in Issue 2 prevents this." But the statutory process for removal presents an extremely high hurdle. The process would not begin until a complaint is filed with signatures totalling at least 15 percent of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. That means more than 577,000 registered voters would have to sign a complaint -- about 192,000 more than were required to even put Issue 2 on the ballot. Tokaji admitted that’s a high threshold to meet, but said the legislature could amend the laws to ease the requirement to initiate the removal process. Issue 2 opponents argue that the existing Ohio law for removing officeholders would not apply to redistricting commission members. They point out that the proposed amendment prohibits the General Assembly and executive branch from removing a commission member. But while the amendment states that lawmakers cannot remove commission members. It does not say that they have no authority to enact laws that govern how members can be removed. So where does that leave us? Is Husted’s claim, that a member who accepted a bribe could not be removed from the commission, plausible? No. A bribery conviction would disqualify a commission member from serving. Further, a commission member could be subject to the judicial removal process in the Ohio Revised Code. Husted is correct about the language in the ballot issue -- there’s nothing in the proposal that allows for the commission to remove one of its members engaged in questionable activity. But that’s not what he said to reporters in his interview. And he went too far when he said a commission member could remain after accepting a bribe. Although there isn’t a removal process within the proposed amendment, others exist in state law. Husted’s statement is not accurate. That’s a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-14554	"Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/11/hillary-clinton/debate-hillary-clinton-says-americans-havent-had-r/	During her opening statement at the Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis., Hillary Clinton tried to channel the frustration that has led many voters to consider backing her opponent, Bernie Sanders. "I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy, and for good cause," Clinton said. "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years." Many individual American households have seen their incomes rise since the turn of the century. But we’ll take a look at the most basic measure of how well Americans more generally are doing income-wise -- namely, median household income, adjusted for inflation. As shown in the following graph from the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, inflation-adjusted median household income generally rose between 1984 and 1999, then began falling starting in 1999 and 2000. Specifically, median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $48,664 in 1984 to $57,843 in 1999 -- a 19 percent increase over 15 years. Then, over the next 15 years it fell to $53,657, a decline of 7 percent. So by this measure, Clinton is correct. Other statistics are somewhat less clear-cut. Consider the median usual weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over. Here’s the St. Louis Fed’s graph for that statistic: Using this measure, wages are up slightly since 2000. That’s a raise, but it’s a pretty modest one of 2 percent over the past 15 years. That compares to a 6 percent increase between 1984 and 2000. In one sense, wages are a reasonable yardstick to use in judging Clinton’s claim, since this statistic focuses on people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis -- the very kind of people who would be in line to "get a raise" if employers were so inclined. On the other hand, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth. Many households either see a share of their income in government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments, rather than wages or salaries, and this income is not reflected in the the second statistic we looked at. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it’s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement. Our ruling Clinton said, "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years." Using inflation-adjusted median household income, she’s right. There has actually been a decline of 7 percent over that period. However, earnings of wage and salary workers have risen over that period -- by about 2 percent. That’s a tepid increase. But, it is an increase. On balance, we rate Clinton’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02366	Says President Abraham Lincoln "tried to arm the slaves."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/18/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-lincoln-tried-arm-slaves/	In the libertarian view, it is the right of the oppressed to rise up against their oppressors. Accordingly, while Andrew Napolitano argued with host Jon Stewart on The Daily Show that President Abraham Lincoln should have avoided war with the Confederacy, he said the slaves should have fought. Napolitano: "If the slaves had gone to war against their slave owners, and I had been alive, I would have been with them. I would have helped finance, fund and lead that revolt." Stewart: "Are you familiar with slavery?" Napolitano: "I am very familiar with it." Stewart: "That is not the option." Napolitano: "No, no, no. Lincoln tried to arm the slaves." We tried to find out what lies behind Napolitano’s claim that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves, but we never heard from the judge or his staff. We turned to Bruce Levine, a Civil War historian at the University of Illinois. "I know of no evidence -- have never even heard it said -- that Lincoln himself tried to arm those who were still slaves to enable a slave insurrection -- and I very strongly doubt that any such evidence exists," Levine said. Levine said an early draft of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation included the idea that if the slaves rose up, Union troops would do nothing to stop them. But that disappeared from the final version. "Because even that was considered too politically incendiary," Levine said. There is one way that the statement might be said to have some truth, though it's a stretch. As the war got underway, some people in slavery were able to get away and seek refuge with Union troops. This created a legal quandary for some commanders because under federal law, these people were still the property of their owners. Congress provided legal cover in two steps. In 1861, it passed the First Confiscation Act, which allowed Union soldiers to treat these people as property seized by the government. The act did not set them free but it did strip the owners of any claim to them if they had been put to work on "any fort, navy yard, dock, armory, ship, entrenchment, or in any military or naval service whatsoever." In 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which went further. For slaveholders who sided with the Confederacy, any slave that came under Union control "shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves." This step actually troubled Lincoln who was uneasy about its constitutionality. The act went further and authorized Lincoln to "employ as many persons of African descent as he may deem necessary and proper for the suppression of this rebellion, and for this purpose he may organize and use them in such manner as he may judge best for the public welfare." Columbia historian Eric Foner, who appeared on the The Daily Show with Stewart and Napolitano, told PunditFact that Congress’ intent was clear. "Congress authorized Lincoln to use blacks in any capacity he chose -- laborers, soldiers, etc.," Foner said. "In the fall, the War Department authorized raising black troops on the Sea Islands of South Carolina, under the command of the white abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson." Because this preceded the Emancipation Proclamation by several months, it could be argued that these newly liberated people were slaves armed by the Union, but that seems like a legal stretch and hardly what people hearing Napolitano’s comments would conclude. In one interesting twist, the Confederacy did try to arm slaves, Levine said. It took place late in the war and was extremely controversial. A month before the South surrendered, the Confederate Congress allowed slave owners to donate their slaves to the cause. In contrast to the Union laws, these people would not become free. The effort remained small and went nowhere. Our ruling Napolitano said that Lincoln tried to arm the slaves. Napolitano provided no supporting proof and no historian we contacted knew of any such effort by the president. The Union efforts to strip Confederate slave owners of their legal claims to enslaved people ultimately led to the formation of units of black soldiers. While these men might not have enjoyed clear legal status as free men, they could not be called slaves. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01944	"I don't own a single stock or bond … I have no savings accounts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/24/joe-biden/biden-says-he-has-no-stocks-bonds-or-savings-accou/	Following in Hillary Clinton's footsteps, Vice President Joe Biden made a splash with a statement about his personal finances. At President Barack Obama's Summit for Working Families Monday, Biden made an attempt to seem relatable to the typical American family by talking about his modest finances. "I don't own a single stock or bond ... I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension, and I got a good salary," he said. Even though Biden was known as one of the poorest members of Congress while he was a senator, the statement raised some eyebrows. Just last week, we rated Clinton's claim that she and former President Bill Clinton were "dead broke" when they left the White House as Mostly False. So how do Biden’s finances stack up? At the North American International Auto Show in January, Biden said that when he first ran for office in 1972, he promised he would never own any stocks or bonds. Biden’s office declined to comment on the record about his finances and whether or not he lived up to that promise. But we were able to look at Biden’s 2013 executive branch personnel public financial disclosure report, which was submitted just last month. The report lists about a dozen investments, all of which fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range. However, they're not strictly his. All 11 are designated by the letter "S"-- used to indicate that the holding belongs to the filer’s spouse. That means the 11 investments are owned by Jill Biden, his wife of 37 years. But the savings accounts are a different story. According to the disclosure documents, the Bidens have five savings accounts, which fall into a larger range. Some amounted to less than $1,001, while others fell into the $50,001 - $100,000 category. Four of the five accounts belong to the vice president's wife, while the final one has the classification "J" -- a joint account that belongs to both of them. This U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union account's holdings fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range. Even if the investments aren't in the vice president's name, they are part of his household wealth, and he stands to benefit from their success, said George Pennacchi, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Jeffrey Hoopes, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, compared the situation to a household with two cars -- where each spouse drives a car, but both titles are only in the husband's name. "For (the wife) to say she did not own a car would be slightly disingenuous, even if legally true," Hoopes said. Additionally, pension funds invest in stocks and bonds or other assets, Pennacchi said. "Thus, it is inescapable that Mr. Biden’s wealth is both directly and indirectly linked to stock and bond investments," Pennacchi said. Biden also holds four checking accounts, two of which he shares with his wife. In addition, he holds six life insurance policies with Mass Mutual. The Bidens reported an adjusted gross income of $407,099 last year, including his vice presidential salary of $230,700. Our ruling Biden said, "I don't own a single stock or bond... I have no savings accounts." Biden was wrong to say that he doesn't have a savings account because he shares one with his wife. However, he doesn't have ownership over any stocks and bonds -- those all belong to his wife. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2014-06-24T11:41:29	2014-06-23	['None']
pomt-04695	Says Republicans Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan support "massive cuts in Social Security for future generations."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/05/joe-biden/biden-says-romney-and-ryan-support-massive-cuts-so/	In a campaign stop in Green Bay, Vice President Joe Biden rolled out familiar Democratic criticisms of the Republican budget proposal approved by the U.S. House in early 2012, contending the party wants "massive" cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. But Biden added another lightning-rod issue: Social Security, which has received little discussion so far in the 2012 presidential campaign. "Ladies and gentlemen, it’s just that simple. We are for Medicare, they are for voucher care. It’s basic," the veep said at a Sept. 2, 2012 rally. "They are for massive cuts in Social Security for future generations." He added: "These are the facts!" But wait. That House GOP budget plan, authored by Mitt Romney’s running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, did not touch on the Social Security reform ideas contained in Ryan’s earlier "Roadmap for America’s Future." Is Biden right about "massive" cuts being on the GOP agenda? When asked to back up the statement, Biden’s campaign sent us a memo -- authored by Harvard economist David Cutler and released March 22, 2012, by the Obama-Biden campaign -- that said Romney has proposed adjusting the benefit formula so that retirees above a certain income level would see major benefit cuts, and had proposed slowly increasing the Social Security retirement age. Cutler, who was Obama’s senior health care adviser in the 2008 presidential campaign, termed the Romney-backed cuts "deep" and "devastating." A look at the plan Here’s what we know for sure, from Romney’s website and public statements about his views on strengthening the Social Security trust fund, which actuaries say will be depleted by 2033: -- He opposes a Social Security payroll tax hike as part of a rescue plan, preferring to cut benefit costs. -- His plans would not affect those already retired or 55 and over. -- For future generations, he endorses slowly increasing the retirement age. -- Also for future generations, benefits should rise at a lower rate for those with "higher" incomes. Romney expanded briefly on this during the Fox New/Wall Street Journal debate on Jan. 16, 2012. "I’d lower the rate of inflation growth in the benefits received by higher-income recipients and keep the rate as it is now -- pretty high -- for lower income recipients," Romney said. "And I’d also add a year or two to the retirement age under Social Security. That balances Social Security." His campaign told us: "Romney’s plan would strengthen and protect Social Security going forward. What’s the Obama plan to avert the cuts projected to start in 2033?" Growth in benefits Romney’s inflation proposal echoes a concept in past cost-cutting proposals offered by Republicans -- including Ryan in 2008 and 2010 -- and by a commission appointed by George W. Bush early in that decade. Cutler points to another plan, by Republican senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and Mike Lee from 2011, that pushed the concept. It’s important to note that Obama-Biden is not claiming that Romney supported any of those earlier plans, which may differ from his own. But it is citing them for support on the impact of such a proposal. The idea common to all the plans is known as "progressive price indexing," and it changes the way recipients’ initial retirement benefit is calculated. Currently, the benefit formula is tied to the change in average American wages. The reform proposals would rely more on the consumer price index, a closely watched measure of the cost of consumer goods and services. In Ryan’s view, expressed in his 2010 "Roadmap for America’s Future," the current approach "exceeds the amount of initial benefit growth needed to keep pace with economic conditions, and contributes to the unsustainable projected burden on Social Security." (The "Roadmap" plan was Ryan’s own vision as Budget Committee chairman, and, unlike his subsequent budget plans, did not come to a vote in the House). This formula change on how to keep pace with inflation can generate big savings over time in benefits paid out. That’s in part because prices historically have risen more slowly than wages, according to actuarial studies done by the Social Security Administration of various proposals. It’s called "progressive" because the idea cushions the benefit cut for lower-income workers -- even to the point of actually increasing benefits for some in that group. But as the change phases in over decades, "higher-income" earners -- as Romney calls them -- would be getting a reduced initial benefit at retirement under the change. How much of a cut? The Graham-Paul-Lee bill would have held harmless workers in the lowest 40 percent of earners. But starting at a career average of $43,084 in earnings, that inflation-factor change would mean 4.5 percent drop in the initial Social Security check for those turning 65 in 2030 after working more than four decades, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary reported in April 2011. (That hypothetical worker is 47 today). For an earner hitting retirement age in 2080, the projected cut is larger, 14.5 percent. (That hypothetical worker will be born in 2015). The reductions in that initial check get much larger as incomes increase: up to 28.4 percent by 2080 for those averaging $68,934; and up to 36.1 percent less for those averaging $106,800. And that is only considering the effect of the Graham-Paul-Lee "progressive price indexing plan." The other change it proposed was a phased-in, higher retirement age and early retirement age. Add in the lost benefits from having to wait longer for that first check, and the reduction by 2080 is 28.8 percent to 54.4 percent going from low to high incomes. So we are talking real money. It’s far down the road, but Biden in his speech made clear he was talking about "future generations." A key question is whether it’s reasonable for Obama-Biden to use the three senators’ plan as a benchmark for Romney’s views. There are striking similarities on the surface. Both rely on benefit cuts not tax increases, and both have as their only planks the progressive price indexing change and a higher retirement age. "I just looked up the closest plan to his," Cutler told us. "And it’s been evaluated." Social Security experts from groups with differing points of view on reform told us the devil is in the details when trying to judge whether Romney’s plan would make "massive" cuts. Webster Phillips, senior policy analyst at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said Romney has not offered specific details that would allow a judgment on the precise impact. But Phillips said the Romney plan is in the mold of the Robert Pozen plan that drew attention to progressive price indexing under President George W. Bush, and has some things in common with an idea proposed in 2011 by the Obama-appointed, bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, popularly known as Bowles-Simpson. "No matter how you parse it, it’s a substantial benefit reduction for individual workers," said Phillips. The organization is funded by membership dues and resists benefit cuts to Social Security and Medicare. "If you just use cuts, they have to be substantial," Phillips said. Phillips wouldn’t endorse, or denounce, Biden’s characterization of Romney-Ryan’s Social Security cuts as "massive." David John is a veteran tracker of Social Security reform at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which advocates for a higher retirement age and targeting Social Security to those most in need. He recalled that large benefit reductions were attributed to the Bush-Pozen "progressive indexing plan." John acknowledged that the indexing change does alter benefits, but cautioned that "you really can’t determine how it’s going to change benefits until you look precisely what they’re talking about. It needs details." "You can apply it in a dozen different ways," John said. John said it’s fair to take into account that if nothing is done on Social Security’s finances, policy makers essentially are forcing a 25 percent benefit cut will take place in just over two decades -- much sooner than the inflation indexing-related increases. Obama has acknowledged the need to consider "all measures" to rein in entitlement spending but wrote in 2011 that he resists approaches that "slash" benefits for future generations. He has not offered a plan as part of the 2012 campaign. We note that in 2011 private negotiations with GOP congressional leaders over debt reduction, there were hints that he was proposing some kind of change in how inflation is calculated in determining benefits, according to a Washington Post account. John, of Heritage, said "massive cuts" overstates the case, because Romney could structure his indexing plan in a way to spread out the reductions, or concentrate them at the highest income group. But critics on the left cite research and the government’s actuarial studies to argue that even retirees of modest incomes would feel the crunch under plan’s that are labeled "progressive." Our rating In a campaign speech, Biden hammered the Romney-Ryan ticket for supporting "massive cuts in Social Security for future generations." He doesn’t cite a specific plan from Romney (or Ryan), but major benefit reductions well down the road based on a proposal that mirrors Romney’s Social Security reforms in some key respects. It’s clear that Romney’s approach of raising the retirement age and re-jiggering inflation indexing without raising taxes will lead to benefit cuts over time. That’s the point. The boost in retirement age cuts payments across the board; the indexing change asks more from higher earners but could also hit many middle-income people as well if his plan follows the form of past proposals. It’s equally clear that it’s premature to judge exactly who will be affected, and how, because Romney has not laid out key details. We think his claim lands at Half True.

pomt-14841	Says Ted Cruz "is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally" and "proposed giving them work permits."	false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-supports-legal-status-an/	Florida’s Marco Rubio, asked by a reporter if Texan Ted Cruz is perhaps more serious about stopping illegal immigration, shot back that the freshman senators competing for the Republican presidential nomination share common ground. Rubio, who helped propel Senate approval of an immigration overhaul in 2013 that included a path to citizenship for immigrants already living here, replied at a South Carolina event Nov. 12, 2015: "Ted is a supporter of legalizing people who are in this country illegally." That’s kind of a head-snapper. Among presidential hopefuls, Cruz holds himself out as tougher than the rest against giving ground to people living in the U.S. without legal authorization. In September 2015, PolitiFact rated Mostly True Cruz’s claim that he alone among 10 candidates (including Rubio) at the CNN Reagan Library debate never backed "amnesty" for immigrants. Research suggested he was the only one who had never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or another form of legal status. But Rubio suggested in South Carolina that when the Senate was debating its plan, Cruz was on board with giving immigrants legal status. "In fact, when the Senate bill was proposed," Rubio said, Cruz "proposed legalizing people that were here illegally. He proposed giving them work permits. He’s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards. He's supported a massive expansion of the H-1B program, a 500 percent increase. So, if you look at it, I don't think our positions are dramatically different." Cruz has called for expanded legal immigration. In 2013, he unsuccessfully offered amendments to the Senate plan to quintuple H-1B visas, which are open to foreign workers with certain specialties, and to step up the number of green cards, which permit foreign nationals to live and work here permanently. The Cuban American lawyer talks up similar goals on his campaign website where his immigration proposals are preceded by this poke at the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" immigration effort that was joined by Rubio in 2013: "When Establishment Republicans teamed up with Democrats to reward millions of illegal immigrants with amnesty," Cruz says, "I engaged millions of men and women across the country. Together, we defeated President Obama’s attempt to pass amnesty." So, is Rubio right that Cruz supports giving a legal status to people living here illegally — and even proposed work permits for them? Rubio camp cites Cruz’s comments at hearing Rubio spokesman Alex Conant, asked to explain how Rubio reached his conclusions, told us Cruz’s comments during the 2013 discussion about the immigration bill show he favors giving illegal immigrants living here some kind of legal status. By email, Rubio’s camp said an amendment offered by Cruz during the 2013 Senate deliberations demonstrates Rubio’s point. Ultimately, that’s not how we interpreted Cruz’s actions and statements during the 2013 debate that involved the Senate advancing an immigration plan that died without action in the House. Cruz’s actions, comments in 2013 Senate deliberations Let’s walk through what Cruz proposed, what he said about his proposal and whether he has otherwise embraced a legal status for immigrants living here without legal authorization. On May 21, 2013, Cruz issued a press release saying that he’d offered amendments to the Senate measure that day to "ensure that illegal immigrants are not given a path to citizenship, and modernize, streamline and expand legal immigration by reforming the green card program." In the release, Cruz’s office provided video of Cruz talking about his amendments during that day’s meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Per his unsuccessful proposal to remove the plan’s "path to citizenship" provisions, Cruz said at the hearing that in his view, for immigration reform to credibly fix "the problem," border security should be toughened, legal immigration should be elevated, and "there should not be a pathway to citizenship for those who are here illegally." Cruz further said that if the path to citizenship were eliminated from the Senate plan, as he proposed, some 11 million residents living "in the shadows" would "still be eligible for RPI status." The Senate plan ultimately provided that immigrants in the country without legal authorization could apply for an envisioned Registered Provisional Immigrant program, which would result in a work permit also enabling a successful applicant to travel outside the U.S. and return. A person with RPI status for 10 years would be eligible to apply for permanent residency, as in a green card. Cruz continued: "They would still be eligible for legal status and indeed, under the terms of the bill, they would be eligible for" green card "status as well so that they are out of the shadows, which the proponents of this bill repeatedly point to as their principal objective, to provide a legal status for those who are here illegally to be out of the shadows," Cruz said. Other Cruz comments According to a Bloomberg News story posted the day after Rubio commented on Cruz in South Carolina, the Texan said he laughed on hearing the "false" idea that he supports giving work permits to people living here without legal permission. On the other hand, Rubio's campaign pointed out news stories that it described as demonstrating Cruz was amenable to giving immigrants legal status. In June 2013, Cruz told NPR News that if senators embraced his proposal stripping out the path to citizenship option, the "11 million who are here illegally would be granted legal status once the border was secured — not before — but after the border was secured, they would be granted legal status. And indeed, they would be eligible for permanent legal residency. But they would not be eligible for citizenship." Later, Cruz was described in September 2013 by the Texas Tribune as supportive of giving immigrants living here legal status--though not a way to citizenship. The story said: Asked about what to do with the people here illegally, however, he (Cruz) stressed that he had never tried to undo the goal of allowing them to stay. "The amendment that I introduced removed the path to citizenship, but it did not change the underlying work permit from the Gang of Eight," he said during a recent visit to El Paso. By phone, Brian Phillips, a Cruz campaign spokesman, told us that each example of Cruz mentioning work permits in the Senate plan amounted to Cruz simply explaining what would remain in the Senate plan if the path to citizenship element were yanked--and, Phillips said, Cruz never said he would vote for the plan, regardless. Other analysts Separately, Mark Krikorian, who advocated against the 2013 bill, told Bloomberg News that Cruz’s amendment to remove the path to citizenship element was a legislative tactic. "You often introduce measures you hope will be poison pills if you're trying to kill a piece of legislation," said Krikorian who works for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. We asked Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, about Rubio’s claim. Chmielenski, who closely monitored the Senate during the immigration debate, said by email he doesn’t think Cruz "was ever willing to support legalization" of immigrants living here "before enforcement" of border security. "That's a different position from Rubio," Chmielenski said. By phone, Chmielenski said that there also was no Cruz amendment proposing to give work permits to people living here without legal authorization. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz "is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally" and "proposed giving them work permits." To the contrary, we found no sign of Cruz proposing to give work permits to immigrants living here without legal permission and no record of Cruz explicitly saying he favored giving such residents legal status.

pomt-15289	The Iran deal says that "if any other country tries to undermine (Iran's) nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies."	false	/florida/statements/2015/jul/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-iran-deal-means-we-have-help-defe/	Sen. Marco Rubio says that part of the Iran deal could force the United States into the position of helping Iran defend itself against our allies, including Israel. "At the last minute, they were able to get all sorts of outrageous concessions including the concession that I talked about earlier which now says this: Iran, we have to help Iran protect itself against sabotage," Rubio said on Fox News July 22. "If any other country tries to undermine their nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies." As the Republican from Florida campaigns for president, he has repeatedly criticized the recently negotiated nuclear deal with Iran. Is he correct that the deal would force the United States to defend Iran from Israel and Egypt and Saudia Arabia? The Iran deal Six major powers including the United States reached an agreement this month with Iran with the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear bomb. The agreement has several components that include allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor Iranian assets and lifting sanctions. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously in favor of it while it is expected to receive a vote in Congress in September. A spokeswoman for Rubio’s campaign pointed to Article 10, Annex III, of the agreement which states: "E3/EU+3 parties, and possibly other states, as appropriate, are prepared to cooperate with Iran on the implementation of nuclear security guidelines and best practices." That includes the following: • "Co-operation in the form of training courses and workshops to strengthen Iran's ability to prevent, protect and respond to nuclear security threats to nuclear facilities and systems as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems; • "Co-operation through training and workshops to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems." This Article has been criticized in the Israeli media. "One of the clauses in the nuclear deal reached between world powers and Iran last week guarantees that the world powers will assist Iran in thwarting attempts to undermine its nuclear program," Israel Hayom, a newsletter, wrote July 20. But experts told PolitiFact that such interpretations are, at best, exaggerated. The aim of the provision, they said, is to protect nuclear materials from theft (say, if terrorists tried to steal Iranian assets) or from sabotage (with the intent of causing a hazardous-materials threat to health). For years, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, the United States has pushed countries around the world to improve security for their nuclear material and facilities, said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard and an expert on nuclear theft and terrorism. This agreement furthers that goal, he said. "It has nothing to do with helping Iran protect its nuclear facilities from a military attack" of the kind that Israel or Egypt might carry out, Bunn said. "It’s about protecting against thieves and terrorists who might want to steal nuclear material or sabotage a nuclear facility." Bunn called Rubio’s interpretation "absurd," asking whether the senator "thinks it would be a good thing if a terrorist attack led to a Fukushima-scale release from the Bushehr reactor?" Bunn added that by its plain language, the provision does not obligate any of the signatories, including the United States, to do anything in particular. Rather, it says the signatories are "prepared" to cooperate with Iran on these topics, with lots of wiggle room for all sides. "My guess is that very little cooperation in these areas will take place," Bunn said. Russia and China might be willing to do some training, but nothing would force the United States to do so. If the United States did participate, there’s even some historical precedent for intelligence gains from this sort of activity, Bunn said. He said United States’ cooperation with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union dramatically reduced the risk that nuclear material would be stolen and gave the U.S. insights into the Russian nuclear complex. Meanwhile, the agreement allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- training for Iran in protecting against threats such as cyber-sabotage. Some see this as ironic because of reports that Obama secretly ordered the Stuxnet computer virus to be launched against Iran to derail its nuclear program. But it’s hard to believe that the U.S. would share its secrets in this realm, and the agreement doesn’t force them to do so. "Do you seriously think that any training we might offer Iran would help them ward off another Stuxnet?" Bunn said. "This is really silly. There are good arguments on both sides about this agreement, but this isn’t one of them." Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. and a career Army officer, agreed that the agreement doesn’t prevent the U.S. from attacking Iran using cyber or other means or require the U.S. to develop measures to counter a future cyber attack. "The intent (of the provision) is to make certain that Iran is capable to protect nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and help it prevent sabotage," he said. Justin Logan, director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that while this particular article in the agreement is not very well defined, "I would assume on the U.S. side that it is interpreted as pertaining to the sorts of nuclear insecurity we would worry about, not the kind we’ve been engaged in over the past several years. It’s a perfectly reasonable thing to ask about, but it’s irresponsible to jump to conclusions about its interpretation, as Rubio has here," he said. The strongest argument for the provision being problematic is that it could make it harder for the United States or its allies to degrade the Iranian nuclear complex if Iran doesn’t abide by the agreement. "At one level, this is a good thing because there is an overriding interest in ensuring that nuclear materials are safeguarded," Brennan said. "On the other hand, success in developing these security protocols would also make it more difficult to attack or degrade the program in the future should Iran violate the terms of the agreement." The administration has been clear about how it interprets this provision. A day after Rubio made his claim on Fox News, he quizzed Secretary of State John Kerry on this portion of the deal during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Here is an excerpt: Rubio: "If Israel conducts an airstrike against a physical facility, does this deal, the way I read it, does it require us to help Iran protect and respond to that threat?" Kerry: "No." Rubio followed up with a similar question: Rubio: "If Israel conducts cyber attack against Iranian nuclear program are we obligated to help them defend themselves against the Israeli cyberattack?" Kerry: "No, I assure you, that we will be coordinating very, very closely with Israel as we do on every aspect of Israel’s security." Our ruling Rubio said that according to the Iran deal, "if any other country tries to undermine (Iran’s) nuclear program, we have to help them defend themselves against Israel, Egypt, Saudis, our own allies." The claim rests on an interpretation of a provision that the U.S. and other partners are prepared where "appropriate" to cooperate with training to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage. But this provision is targeted at terrorists and saboteurs, not "countries" as Rubio put it, and certainly not toward such U.S. allies as Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Kerry made clear that that’s how the administration is interpreting it. And even if you adopt Rubio’s more expansive interpretation, nothing in the agreement says the United States will "have to" offer assistance, as Rubio puts it; the language of the provision offers significant wiggle room surrounding who, if anyone, might provide such assistance. We rate the claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-07-23T17:42:01	2015-07-22	['Egypt', 'Iran', 'Saudi_Arabia', 'Israel']
pomt-05276	"There’s 400 more people working in health care today in New Hampshire than when we passed the budget."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/may/25/william-obrien/obrien-says-health-care-employment-has-grown-despi/	To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the demise of New Hampshire’s health care system have been greatly exaggerated – according to Speaker of the House William O’Brien, at least. Last year, the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed its $10.3 billion budget, which cut millions in funding for hospitals and health care providers. Funding to nursing homes was reduced by more than $30 million, according to administrators who decried the cuts, and hospitals lost $258 million over the two-year budget. But now, a year later, not only has the bleeding stopped, but the health care industry has even gained jobs since the budget passed, according to O’Brien, R-Mont Vernon. "You know what’s interesting about those layoffs?" O’Brien asked rhetorically during a May 7 meeting with The Telegraph’s editorial board. "There’s 400 more people working in health care today in New Hampshire than when we passed the budget." In recent years, health care has been one of few industries to grow despite the recession. But did New Hampshire’s health care industry not only rebound from the cuts, but grow to the tune of 400 jobs? We decided to crunch the numbers. When asked for the source of O’Brien’s figures, Shannon Shutts, a spokeswoman for the House of Representatives, pointed to the New Hampshire Employment Security agency. The office, which runs the state’s job centers and manages unemployment benefits, issues both quarterly and monthly employment reports estimating job growth in specific industries. According to the Employment Security office’s Current Employment Statistics report, 84,900 people worked in New Hampshire’s health care and social assistance fields in April 2012, the most recent numbers available. That number, based on employment surveys of selected hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies, among others, is exactly the same as April 2011 and 100 fewer than March 2011. So that doesn’t show the gain O’Brien claimed. The House of Representatives passed its budget March 31, 2011, but it didn’t approve the final version of the budget for another three months, until June 22, 2011. According to the state jobs office, employment in the health care and social assistance sectors in June 2011 was 85,600. But it declined by 700 more by April 2012. In addition, at the time O’Brien made the claim May 7, the April 2012 unemployment numbers hadn’t been posted to the state’s website. If we calculate his claim using the March 2012 data that was available at the time, the numbers look even worse, since there were 400 fewer health care jobs in March than in April 2012. "What you see in health care is really more of a slowdown," said Annette Nielsen, an economist with the economic and labor market information bureau within the employment security office. "A couple of years ago, you would see 2 or 3 percent strong growth over the year, and then even through the beginning of the recession, that was really the only bright spot there was," she said. "That is definitely slowing down." The state’s health care employment numbers, as classified by the economic security office, include both health care and social assistance jobs. Health care jobs include those working in hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics and nursing homes. Meanwhile, social assistance is defined as child care workers and home care providers for the elderly and those with disabilities, among others. But even without considering the social assistance fields, O’Brien’s numbers are still off. Hospitals across the state gained 100 jobs from April 2011 to April 2012, rising to 28,300 last month, according to the state report. But ambulatory care services, including chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, mental health professionals and diagnostic technicians, lost 1,300 jobs during that period. Compared to figures from June 2011, ambulatory care jobs were down 1,500 in April 2012 and hospital jobs suffered 200 losses, according to the state data. Admittedly, the state’s monthly job estimates are not perfect, acknowledged Nielson, of the employment security office. The figures are based on surveys collected from a sampling of employers, which are often returned late, and they don’t always reflect new and emerging businesses, she said. For a more accurate measure, economists often look to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report. The report, released every three months, is based on actual employment data reported to the employment security office for unemployment benefits claims. But because the data takes time to collect and analyze, reports are released only every three months. The most report reflects employment data through September 2011. According to that data, from April 2011 to September 2011, six months after the House passed the state budget and the longest period of available data, the number of people working in health care in the state grew by 402 jobs. Yet when using the June starting date, when the state budget took effect, there was a loss of 178 jobs during the next quarter of a year. Either way, this data is now eight months old, and much can – and likely has – changed in that time, Nielson said. "You can’t compare the two," she said. "They’re two different time periods. … The trend is (that job growth is) really starting to flatten out." Our ruling The health care industry was a bright spot during the recession, but job estimates show that it didn’t rebound from the state budget cuts the way O’Brien reported. The most recent state estimates show that jobs in the health care industry, combined with social assistance, have remained flat or even decreased – not gained – since April 2011, when the House initially passed the budget. And since the state budget took effect in June 2011, the industry has lost about 700 jobs. There is one measure that shows some growth, but it was only a snapshot and doesn’t cover the time period O’Brien was talking about. Based on the most authoritative numbers that include the most recent data, we rate this claim False.	None	William O'Brien	None	None	None	2012-05-25T12:31:04	2012-05-07	['None']
pomt-02958	Wendy Davis is "threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/25/greg-abbott/davis-has-not-threatened-tax-hikes-favors-careful-/	Greg Abbott, the second-term Texas attorney general seeking to succeed Gov. Rick Perry in the 2014 election, paints the Democrat in the race as inclined to higher taxes. Abbott, a Republican, said on a Facebook page: "Wendy Davis has entered the ring, threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion to pay for new government spending. The Wendy Davis Agenda will bring California values to our state if we don’t stop her." Abbott’s web page was brought to our attention by Austin political consultant Steven Rivas. To our inquiry, Abbott campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch said Abbott based his tax-threat statement on news stories reporting on the Fort Worth senator’s Sept. 29, 2013, appearance at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. According to an Associated Press news story posted online that day, Davis said there that she opposes raising sales or property tax rates, "but thinks the Legislature needs to review $35 billion in tax exemptions on the books." Hirsch noted a similar online news post that day by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36, and pointed out an online news post by KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas. We’ll explore the cited interview. First, let’s revisit what officials usually mean when they refer to such exemptions. In the latest annual accounting of state tax exemptions, state Comptroller Susan Combs reported in March 2013 that in the fiscal year running through August 2013, "exemptions" from state sales, franchise, gas and motor vehicle sales taxes will total nearly $38 billion, with sales-tax exemptions accounting for nearly $36 billion of that. Combs said those totals reflected both simple exemptions and a range of ways that taxes are not due, including "exclusions, discounts, deductions, special accounting methods, credits, refunds, and special appraisals." A straight-up exemption, Combs wrote, "protects items that would be taxable except for specific provisions in the law. For example, since the Texas sales tax law taxes all sales of tangible personal property, groceries would be taxable if they were not specifically exempted." Texas sales-tax exemptions include basic necessities such as groceries, residential gas and electric utilities, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Other sales are exempted when made to certain groups, Combs wrote. "For example, governmental bodies and religious and nonprofit educational groups buy items for their own use tax-free. Other exemptions apply because the tax would be impractical to collect," she said. "For example, those who make only occasional sales (one or two sales of taxable items per year) do not collect the tax; however, purchasers with permits are responsible for remitting the tax." Some examples of purchases exempted from sales tax: sales of water, film production equipment, newspapers, magazine subscriptions, aircraft, certain court reporting services and even the first $25 of a monthly basic Internet connection fee. Other major taxes also have exemptions, according to the report. Insurance companies are exempt from the business franchise tax; they pay a tax on premiums. Nonprofits and certain cooperatives also are exempt from the franchise tax. Meanwhile, certain purchasers of gas are exempt from the state gas tax; they include licensed aviation fuel dealers, the federal government, Texas public school districts and volunteer fire departments. A video of the September interview of Davis by Evan Smith, the Tribune’s editor in chief, confirms that Davis endorsed a study of tax exemptions as a way of possibly generating more government revenue and that she also vowed to veto increases in sales or property taxes. Smith asked Davis about 20 minutes into the 38-minute interview: "Do you believe that we have enough revenue in this state to meet all of our needs, not just on education but across the board?" "I believe that we do," Davis said, "but I believe we have to really sit back and be thoughtful and smart about how we make our revenue and spending decisions. And a huge piece of that, of course, is the exemptions that we give in the state of Texas today." The senator added that in the 2013 regular legislative session, she supported a proposal by Sens. John Carona, R-Dallas, and Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, "asking us to take a serious look… at the $35-plus billion every biennium that we give up in loopholes and exemptions, setting aside, of course, property tax exemptions which I think are uniformly supported, but these other exemptions that exist in the state of Texas and to ask whether they still make sense." Smith asked if Davis could specify a tax exemption that had "run its course." "I really don’t feel like I can say that," Davis said. "Because what we need instead is a uniform look, a very objective look, with the input of the Legislative Budget Board, the comptroller, the Legislature making those determinations, and receiving, of course, the input from our chambers of commerce and other business partners in Texas to make sure that we’re making good decisions in any changes that we would make." Smith also asked if Davis was prepared to say Texas should not raise taxes for education or other purposes until it makes sure money is already properly spent. Davis said: "I would certainly take a sales tax, a property tax increase off the table. Absolutely. If I had one day, someday, the privilege of being in a leadership position that could veto legislation like that, I would." We asked Davis’ campaign about Abbott’s claim, and Davis spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña said by email that Davis in the 2013 session backed Senate Bill 140, which was authored by Carona and Ellis and co-authored by three other senators, though not Davis, according to legislative records. Acuña told us by email that Davis "supports a process in which the comptroller and the Legislature can review tax preferences to make sure they're continuing to help small businesses and our economy." SB 140, which died at the committee level, called for reviews of statutory "tax preferences," meaning any credit, discount, exclusion, exemption, refund, special valuation, special accounting treatment, special rate or special method of reporting as authorized in relation to a state or local tax imposed in the state. Under the proposal, the budget board would determine each tax preference’s purpose every six years and evaluate if it accomplishes its purpose and if it is "inefficient, ineffective or unnecessary, or if the intended purpose of the tax preference is a low priority" for the state, also evaluating the effect of the preference on economic development, the number of high-wage jobs, funding for public services, the distribution of the tax burden by income class and total income by income class in the state. Board recommendations would then be considered by Texas House and Senate budget-writing committees, which would recommend changes to each preference, including its repeal, the proposal said. Finally, it called for any legislated tax preferences newly taking effect after August 2014 to automatically expire six years later unless lawmakers deemed otherwise. Also as noted by Acuña, Davis voted for a slimmed version of the proposal offered by Ellis as a floor amendment to two measures that won unanimous Senate approval May 21, 2013, according to the Texas Senate Journal. The revised language, adopted both times by voice votes, called for the budget board to review tax preferences every 12 years and estimate each preference’s effects on government revenue, the economy and tax burdens borne by individuals and businesses, among facets. The floor amendment did not call for the board or legislative panels to make recommendations to amend or abolish tax preferences. In the end, though, House Bill 500, related to the franchise tax, and HB 3390, related to the Texas Economic Development Act, passed into law without the Senate-added provisions about tax preferences surviving, according to legislative records. Our ruling Abbott said Davis is threatening to raise taxes up to $35 billion. If Texas eliminated every exemption as defined by the state comptroller, it’s reasonable to speculate that tax revenues would increase about $38 billion a year. But Davis isn’t calling for an across-the-board repeal. In the cited interview, she didn’t even identify an exemption she believes has run its course. Rather, she favors a study involving legislative and public input before final decisions, which at the least leaves resulting tax effects unknown. Abbott’s claim has an element of truth, but generally ignores critical facts that would give an accurate impression. We rate this statement as Mostly False.

pomt-14208	"As a U.S. senator with salary and perks, ‪#‎Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/20/dinesh-dsouza/dinesh-dsouza-incorrectly-places-bernie-sanders-to/	After some prodding, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has started to release more tax information. Some of Sanders’ critics say that his 2014 tax returns indicate Sanders doesn’t practice what he preaches. The critics say he paid a low tax rate on a relatively high income, while assailing the country’s ultra-wealthy for not paying their fair share of taxes. These critics include conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a filmmaker. "As a U.S. Senator with salary and perks, ‪#‎Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year," D’Souza wrote on Facebook April 17. "Can anyone spell HYPOCRITE?" As of publication, D’Souza’s post had been shared more than 60,000 times. Given Sanders’ targeted attacks on the top 1 percent, the claim that Sanders is a member of that group caught our interest. The top 1 percent Sanders and his wife Jane reported a combined income of $205,617 for 2014. The vast majority comes from Sanders’ Senate salary — about $174,000 before contributing to savings and benefits — and the rest comes from Social Security benefits. While significantly above the nation’s median household income of about $53,600, Sanders’ income is not high enough to place him in the top 1 percent of earners. We found a few estimates of how much a person has to make break into this top echelon, but all are much higher than Sanders’ reported income. The Wall Street Journal crunched the numbers for 2014 and found that the minimum income to place in the top 1 percent is around $306,000 — about $100,000 more than the Sanders household currently earns. That being said, the Wall Street Journal calculator places the Sanders household in the top 2 percent of earners. Looking at Sanders’ $174,000 Senate salary alone, he’s in the top 3 percent. A calculator put together by Sentier Research for CNN Money puts the Sanders household in the top 6 percent. D’Souza also said Sanders receives enough Senate perks to push his income into the top 1 percent. In a reply comment on his Facebook post, D’Souza mentioned free travel and entertainment as examples of perks. We reached out to D’Souza’s press line multiple times to get more clarification, but we didn’t hear back. To get that additional $100,000-plus worth in perks — to push Sanders into the top 1 percent of earners — he would have to be "dramatically and egregiously breaking ethics laws and Senate rules," said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. The rules on what kinds of gifts senators can receive are stringent, Huder said. For example, senators cannot take gifts, meals or travel reimbursements from lobbyists, foreign agents or their clients. Also, they cannot receive gifts from private citizens of more than $100 a year. "There really aren't many perks for members," he said. "And without breaking the law, Sanders would have nearly an impossible time collecting enough gifts and travel reimbursement to raise his income to the level of the top 1 percent." Even things like the member gym require a fee, said Dan Abule, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. But income is not the only way to calculate wealth distribution. There’s also the measure of net worth, how much a person owns in assets minus their liabilities. Based on his net worth, Sanders falls on the lower end among his Senate colleagues. Estimating a member of Congress’ net worth is challenging because congressional financial disclosure forms offer only broad ranges of income in various categories. Additionally, some holdings are exempt from disclosure, like the value of a primary residence and retirement accounts. Roll Call estimates senators’ minimum possible net worth and found Sanders’ to be $160,000, ranking him as the 19th-poorest senator. The Center for Responsive Politics, conversely, takes a midpoint estimate. The center estimates Sanders’ net worth to be around $463,000, also landing him the spot of the 19th-poorest senator. By either estimate, he does not own nearly enough assets to land in the top 1 percent based on net worth. The Pew Research Center reported that a person would have to have a net worth of at least $2.3 million, based on Census data. 13 percent in taxes Sanders and his wife paid $27,653 in federal taxes, which is indeed about 13 percent of their income, the amount D’Souza mentioned in his Facebook post. This is about what would be expected for the 2014 tax year, according to an E-File tax calculator. (If you’re doing the math at home, Sanders’ taxable income was $140,994, based on his 2014 returns.) But Sanders has reported also paying $7,903 in state taxes in Vermont. So in total, about 17 percent of his household’s income went to taxes, state and federal combined. D’Souza explained in a comment replying to the post that he wasn’t saying Sanders didn’t pay what he owed under the current law. "Rather, there's a discrepancy between his moral outrage at the rich — who are also paying what they owe — and his refusal to apply that same outrage to his own income," D’Souza wrote. Sanders’ proposed tax plan, however, would not affect his income bracket. He would raise the marginal tax rates on households making $250,000 and above. Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels called D’Souza’s claim "absurd." Our ruling D’Souza said, "As a U.S. senator with salary and perks, ‪#‎Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year." Sanders and his wife made $205,617 in 2014, which is at least $100,000 short of what they would need to make it into the top 1 percent of earners. And it would be near impossible for Sanders to make up the difference with Senate perks, given the stringent rules against gifts. That being said, Sanders’ household income likely lands him in the top 6 percent or higher of earners, so still significantly higher than the average American. About 13 percent of Sanders’ income went to federal taxes; it’s a little higher if we include state taxes. As far as we can tell, though, he paid what was expected of him under current law. D’Souza far overstates Sanders’ earnings, and he makes unprovable accusations about perks that Sanders receives as a senator. We rate his claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df9c222b-a9be-40de-a846-78066affc802	None	Dinesh D'Souza	None	None	None	2016-04-20T11:49:41	2016-04-17	['United_States']
pomt-03227	Atlanta now has as many visitors as Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles. Orlando, Fla., and New York City still have more visitors.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/19/kasim-reed/atlanta-popular-tourists-numbers-lack-clarity/	A land deal for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium moved a step closer to completion last week. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed announced that an agreement had been reached with one of the two churches currently on the preferred building site. (Discussions are ongoing with the second church) Reed later discussed the details of the agreement and next steps during a radio interview on Atlanta’s 680 The Fan. At the end of the interview, Reed was asked about the impact of Atlanta’s two newest attractions, the already operating SkyView Atlanta Ferris wheel and the planned College Football Hall of Fame, which is expected to open in fall 2014. Reed said these types of attractions equate to an "extra day," or features that influence visitors to remain in the city an additional 24 hours. Atlanta’s tourism is doing well, and Reed wants to continue that theme. "Last year we broke a record. We had 42 million people visit the city of Atlanta. We’ve never had that many visitors before," the mayor said. "... We now have as many visitors as Las Vegas, Nevada; San Diego, California, and Los Angeles, California. Orlando and New York City still have more visitors than us. So that’s why this is so important." We know Atlanta is a popular place, but more visitors than Sin City and L.A.? We had to check it out. Reed’s statement was based on information provided by the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, the mayor’s spokeswoman said. According to the Atlanta CVB, the city saw 42.3 million visitors from across the country last year, setting a single-year visitation record. The Atlanta CVB uses a private research company, Virginia-based D.K. Shifflet and Associates, for tourism data. According to its methodology information, each month DKSA surveys traveling and nontraveling households to generate the best estimate of travel volume within the total U.S. population. Travel is defined as either an overnight trip and then returning home, or as a day trip, defined as a place away from home and back in the same day. Information collected includes: travel destination at a city level, hotel stays, purpose of stay, expenditures, length of stay and demographics. We also checked with Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, but it does not have access to city data, a spokeswoman said. That office stands by the figures provided by DKSA. So how did Atlanta’s 2012 numbers stack up against the cities Reed mentioned? We visited each city’s tourism website to compare the numbers. Based simply on the numbers, Reed is correct. Atlanta’s tourism standings could be even better than he claims. Data for Orlando, New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, for example, include foreign and domestic visitors to those cities, according to tourism officials in those cities. But Atlanta’s figure includes only U.S. visitors to the city, said Rachel Peavy, the public relations director for the Atlanta CVB. City # of visitors in 2012* Orlando 57.3 million New York City 52 million Atlanta 42.3 million Los Angeles 41.4 million Las Vegas 39.7 million San Diego 32.3 million *Based on city CVB data, which could be compiled by third-party research firms But visitation data are difficult to verify and compare. Methods of estimating and defining visitation vary from city to city, with no generally accepted standard. Each destination has its own research vendors and methodology for calculating visitor volume, so in many cases they are not directly comparable, said Jamie Faulkner, director of research products for the U.S. Travel Association, a top travel industry group. Her company does not publish any visitor statistics beyond the national level, so Faulkner had no data of her own to test Reed’s claim. But according to other sources, his statement appears correct, she said. Based on DKSA’s visitation data, the Atlanta CVB estimates that the ATL was the sixth-most-visited metro area in the country for U.S. visitors last year. DKSA did not provide rankings. That ranking is in line with a 2010 Forbes magazine ranking that put Atlanta at the seventh-most-visited U.S. city in 2009. Forbes used third-party data to judge cities on things such as hotel occupancy rates, number of foreign arrivals and visitor numbers provided by the cities’ individual convention and visitors bureaus. So was Reed correct in his claim that Atlanta’s tourism numbers have met or exceeded those of other popular travel destinations? Reed said Atlanta’s tourism rates were in the realm of other major cities such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas. His claim is based on information from the city’s convention and visitors bureau. The CVB’s data are provided by a third-party research firm that conducts household surveys to determine Atlanta’s visitation numbers. But that’s where the clarity stops. There is no industry-accepted method for calculating tourism. Each city, tourism office and research company uses its own methods and search criteria. Other firms say Reed’s claim appears correct. But there is really no concrete way to tell. The mayor’s statement needs that bit of detail to clarify his claim. We rated the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09188	As the CEO of eBay, "Whitman started a separate division that only sells porn."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/01/steve-poizner/california-ad-meg-whitman-selling-porn-ebay/	Things have gotten downright dirty in the Republican primary for governor of California. In a web-only video ad, Steve Poizner essentially accused his opponent Meg Whitman of peddling smut. Here's how the woman doing the voice-over put it: "When Meg Whitman joined eBay, the company sold everything, from guns to 'genuine' paintings by famous artists for five bucks to hardcore pornography. Whitman cleaned up the site. No more guns. No more fake paintings. But pornography? Whitman started a separate division that only sells porn. Under Whitman's leadership, the porn site became one of the largest on the Internet." And in an especially creepy moment toward the end, the video shows a slouching teenage boy on a laptop computer. Enough said. The ad says Whitman is "all about the money" and accuses her of "bad judgment" and "wrong values." Web-only video ads are often among the edgiest attack weapons in modern campaigns. And this one is no different. It's true that eBay has an "adult only" section in which people sell pornographic magazines, videos, adult toys etc. But Whitman didn't introduce the idea to start selling adult material on eBay. People were already auctioning adult products on eBay when she came on board as the company's president and CEO in 1998. Rather, not long after taking over, Whitman created the "adult only" section essentially to wall it off from children. By way of research, we went onto eBay to check it out the adult section (we swear, this was new to us). The "adult only" section isn't listed among the favorite categories on the home page. Nor is it in the immediate drop down menu for categories. We found it by clicking on the "everything else" category at the bottom. In order to get in, you've got to sign in, attest to being an adult and provide credit card information. That doesn't sound completely child-proof, but there has been some effort to make it more difficult for kids to get there. And it's not prominently displayed or promoted on the home page. Nonetheless, the section has been successful. In a story under the headline "Republican Meg Whitman's secret past as a porn-peddling CEO at eBay," SF Weekly said porn has been an eBay profit center -- "albeit a relatively tiny, multimillion-dollar one in a company with annual revenues of more than $8 billion." And, the story said, it appears to be a growing part of eBay's revenue stream. The SF Weekly story quoted Scott Newman, former eBay vice president of customer support, saying the Adult Only section posed a quandary for Whitman. "There was a lot of concern whether we should continue having a mature audiences site or not," he said. Whitman "had often gone on the record saying, 'I wish we hadn't started that thing.' But it was kind of like, now it's out of the bag, and to stop it would have caused kind of a big deal, I guess, with the sellers who made their living on the 'mature' site." Whitman apparently pushed for a policy to prohibit the use of PayPal to purchase material from the Adult Only section, but ultimately deferred to company directors who advised against such a ban. On March 27, 2009, Business Week published a Q & A between Whitman and Rajiv Dutta, who had previously served as president of eBay Marketplaces, PayPal and Skype. Dutta: "Now, there was one call that you and I disagreed on. And the issue was: Should we enable Paypal for legal adult and gaming sites?" Whitman: "I said no." Dutta: "Right, that this was out of character for the company to do. And my comeback was that PayPal is a currency, and we cannot use it in some places and not in others. And so, we had this spirited debate, and you let me do what I wanted to do, which was enable PayPal." Whitman: "Yes." Dutta: "Why?" Whitman: "Well, that's a very good question. Why did I do that? No, I'm teasing. Companies are led by collections of individuals. I mean, yes, I was president and CEO of eBay, but you are only as good as the people you surround yourself with. Whether it's a nonprofit institution or a university, you're only as good as the people you surround yourself with. And I think if you want to get the very best people, you need to give them degrees of freedom, you need to give them latitude within a set of defined points of view, rules, if you will. And you need to let them figure it out. And PayPal was a separate division in eBay, which of course is a separate division from Skype. And this was a gray area." Frederick S. Lane, author of the book Obscene Profits, a study of the business of pornography on the Internet, said he found the suggestion that Whitman was a porn peddler is ridiculous. "What Whitman did was carve out a separate section on eBay for adult content," Lane said. "It was done to limit children's access. They perceived like everyone else that the real issue was not exposing children to this material, and the way to do that was to get people to register and indicate that they were adults." Requiring credit card verification is one of the most reliable ways to ensure sites are being used by adults, he said. "I'm uncomfortable characterizing her as the operator of an adult business," Lane said. "I think that's ridiculous." eEbay is essentially a huge flea market, he said, where independent contractors sell things. "It's not like they are producing or directing the production of content," Lane said of eBay. "They don't produce or distribute anything." Still, he said, "it's legitimate to say she profited from these sales. But to suggest that she was running an adult business, that's not an accurate characterization." For it's part, the Whitman campaign has dismissed Poizner's ad as "desperate." "Is Steve Poizner seriously trying to tell us that eBay is a pornography site?" said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. "eBay's millions of users, including my grandmother, will find that a little hard to believe." So is Whitman just another version of (Hustler magazine publisher and onetime California gubernatorial candidate) Larry Flynt, as Poizneer's press secretary suggested recently? We think that's a big stretch. The video ad says that as the CEO of eBay, "Whitman started a separate division that only sells porn." It's true that Whitman created a separate division for eBay that sells porn, but as we noted earlier, it wasn't a case of Whitman introducing a new product line, but rather making a good faith effort to limit those online auctions to adults. That's a big difference. It also renders the video's image of a teenage boy on a laptop ironic. Could Whitman have put her foot down and prohibited the auction of any adult material on eBay? Perhaps. But the way the issue is presented in this ad is awfully misleading. We rate it Half True.	None	Steve Poizner	None	None	None	2010-06-01T10:34:32	2010-06-01	['None']
pomt-04727	"In Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/30/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-romney-narrowed-achievement-gap-mass/	Jeb Bush, who put education at the forefront during his two terms as Florida’s governor, used his pulpit at the Republican National Convention to talk up Mitt Romney’s education record in Massachusetts. "Because he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement. In Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards, and put into place a merit scholarship ... He's a champion for bringing hope to education," Bush said in the Aug. 30 speech. We have examined the claim about Massachusetts’ achievement gap in July, when Romney himself said it. Here’s another look. A little on Massachusetts schools In 1993, lawmakers in Massachusetts passed a landmark reform law that included the groundwork for the state accountability system (later called Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS), authorized charter schools and invested more money in local school districts. Its universal goal was to raise educational standards for all Massachusetts kids. But it’s worth noting that the Bay State is already a leader in student achievement. Massachusetts, which has a disproportionately high number of colleges and universities, some of the nation’s wealthiest ZIP codes and a well-educated workforce, churns out many high-performing students. But the glare of those top achievers makes the shadow of struggling students that much darker. That is to say, Massachusetts still has a significant achievement gap. And because the kids at the top do so well, it’s that much harder for everybody else to catch up. "Our scores are high, so as they get higher it’s pretty hard to move up," said Kathleen Skinner, a policy director at the Massachusetts Teachers Association, a teachers union. Narrowing the gap When we checked this claim before, the Romney campaign pointed us to a 2007 MCAS test results summary, and specifically cited the 10th grade scores: 10th Grade Proficiency In Math o 2005, White: 29%; Black: 19%. Gap = 10 points o 2007, White: 29%; Black: 26%. Gap = 3 points 10th Grade Proficiency In English o 2005, White: 46%; Black: 30%. Gap = 16 points o 2007, White: 52%; Black: 40%. Gap = 12 points That shows the achievement gap narrowing by 7 percentage points in math and by 4 percentage points in English. But the gains in other grades are smaller. Among eighth-graders, the gap tightened by only 1 point in math and 2 points in English. For seventh-graders, the change was 3 points in math, 5 points in English. Sixth grade: 1 point in math, no change in English. In fourth grade scores, the gap narrowed by 1 point in math and widened by 1 point in English. (Some of those are comparisons between 2006 scores and 2007, the only years provided in the test results summary.) Skinner noted an important point about the MCAS: 10th-graders have to pass it in order to graduate. "They start paying attention," she said. We also took a look at scores for the following year, comparing the achievement gap between 2007 and 2008. (These charts offer a slightly different comparison from the previous year, which looked at students who scored "proficient" on each test. The 2007-08 chart includes those scoring proficient and higher.) The best gains again were made by 10th graders who narrowed the gap by six points in English. But there was no change in the gap in math scores, and lower grades showed only one- or two-point gains, or no improvement at all, and the gap widened in a couple of instances, such as eighth-grade science scores. The 2008-2009 test score summary reflected a similar trend: small gains in some subjects and small setbacks in others. Beverly Miyares, also with the Massachusetts Teachers Association, added that the dropout rate among black students in Massachusetts increased from 2002 to 2004, rising from 4.9 to 6.3. That means more under-performing students who dropped out of school didn’t drag down the overall average test scores. Romney’s role In claims such as this, we don’t just consider the accuracy but also whether the speaker deserves credit: How responsible was Romney for narrowing the achievement gap? "The most important point to make with Gov. Romney’s record is that the reform he initiated was part of a much larger and longer movement that existed in Massachusetts," said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent research about public education reform in Massachusetts. Glenn Koocher, executive director with the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, which represents school boards, was less generous: "He had nothing to do with it. It’s the teachers in the classrooms who are making the difference." Skinner, the expert with the teachers’ union, added that Romney was "a somewhat absent ‘education’ governor. He was very agenda driven." "We would argue that he didn’t put anything in place" to narrow the gap, she said. We also wondered whether Romney had pushed any initiatives specifically aimed at helping minority students. Koocher and Skinner both mentioned charter schools, which are favored by many Republicans. "The charter school program was always popular among minority parents (and) any parents that wanted to get their kids out of the public schools," Koocher said, adding that vouchers commonly used to pay tuition at charter schools are unconstitutional in Massachusetts. Instead, the per-pupil state spending is deducted from the public school district’s budget. Ryan Williams, spokesman for the Romney campaign, said protecting the 1993 reform legislation was an important effort by Romney. He said there were attempts to repeal the requirement that 10th graders pass the test in order to graduate, and Romney "stood firm on that and did not back down." "It was one of the bigger things we had success in blocking," Williams said. "A lot of what Romney did when he was governor was to preserve that legislation. He said, ‘I’m not going to roll these standards back.’" Skinner mentioned another, perhaps less obvious, initiative from Romney that helped many minority students: universal health care. Romney signed a health care reform law in Massachusetts that led to a 98 percent coverage rate. "In Massachusetts, all of our kids have health insurance, and I don’t think anybody should underestimate the impact that has on learning. Our kids get vaccinated, they can go to the dentist, they can go to the eye doctor," she said. "Their health is less of an issue than it is in other places." Our ruling Bush said, "in Massachusetts, Gov. Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races." State education figures over two years support Bush’s claim about learning gains when Romney was governor, although it’s worth noting that some areas declined on Romney’s watch, such as the drop-out rate. And it’s always somewhat dubious to take a snapshot of statistics from only one or two years, when, as d'Entremont said, "significant gains in student achievement don’t happen overnight, and the gains in Massachusetts are the result of a 20-year reform effort." What’s more, Romney, a single-term governor, should not get all the credit for improvement in the achievement gap, which is influenced by myriad factors. Bush’s statement about Romney is partially accurate but omits a lot of important information and overstates the former governor’s impact. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06116	Small businesses "create 70 percent of the jobs in America."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/30/eric-cantor/cantor-says-small-businesses-create-70-percent-us-/	What’s good for small business is good for the U.S.A., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has long proclaimed. "Small businesses are the driving force of the economy and create 70 percent of the jobs in America," Cantor, R-7th, said in a Nov. 25 news release stating his support for legislation that would make it more difficult for Washington to impose regulations on small companies. We wondered if small firms really create more than two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. So we asked Cantor’s office what his statement was based on. Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for Cantor, directed us to a September 2010 report from the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy. The study said that 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs come from small businesses. Cantor’s estimate falls midway between that range. What, exactly, is a small business? Federal tax law does not offer a standard definition of the term. The SBA, however, defines a small business as an enterprise with fewer than 500 employees. Brian Headd, an economist with the SBA, said Cantor’s statement is pretty much on the mark. "You can look at different time periods. The numbers will go up and down depending on the year," Headd said. "So it’s a reasonable general statement to make." The SBA research shows small companies typically generate the most net new jobs -- a figure that takes into account job creation from start-ups and expansions as well as job losses from business closings and contractions. In a March 2010 report, Headd said data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that from 1993 through the middle of 2009, small businesses created about 65 percent of the net new jobs in the country. We went in search of a more recent synopsis. The SBA directed us to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the net increase in jobs each quarter broken down by the size of a firm. In the first quarter of 2011, the latest period for which data were available, there were 300,000 net new jobs, about 85 percent of which were created by businesses that have less than 500 employees, according to the BLS data. In 2010, small firms accounted for about 60 percent of the nearly 1.2 million jobs created. We should add a quick qualifier here: The SBA findings only pertain to net new jobs created in the private sector and don’t take into account jobs created by local, state and federal governments. Still, when public officials cite the SBA’s findings on the percentage of jobs created by small businesses, they often refer to small firms creating 70 percent of "all new jobs," or 70 percent of new jobs without noting that’s the percentage for private sector jobs created by smaller firms. That’s understandable since the private sector employs the vast majority of workers in the U.S. In September 2011, the private companies provided nearly 110 million -- or about 85 percent -- of the roughly 131 million jobs in the U.S., according to the BLS. One could reasonably expect small businesses to generate the most jobs in the private sector since, according to the SBA, small firms make up 98 percent of the businesses in the U.S. Overall, about half of the private sector jobs that exist in the U.S. are provided by small businesses, according to the SBA. Though they provide a boost to job creation when times are good, the SBA noted in a 2010 report to President Barack Obama that the flip side is that small businesses can lead the way on job losses when the economy is sluggish. In 2009, when the economy was limping out of a recession, small businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the roughly 5.7 million jobs lost, according to BLS figures. Our ruling: Eric Cantor said small business create 70 percent of the jobs in the U.S. Data from the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that statement is correct when talking about the new jobs created in the private sector, which provides the majority of the jobs in the U.S. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09859	In every committee when the health care bill was considered, Democrats voted against an amendment that would require members of Congress and their staff to take the government-run public option as their health care plan.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/10/newt-gingrich/most-democrats-are-opposed-giving-their-health-car/	To build opposition to a public health insurance option, Republicans have been challenging Democratic lawmakers and White House officials to enroll in the government-run plan. "If Members of Congress believe so strongly that government-run health care is the best solution for hard working American families, I think it only fitting that Americans see them lead the way," said Republican Rep. John Fleming, who is sponsoring a resolution encouraging lawmakers to enroll in the public option, in a statement on his Web site. On the Aug. 9, 2009, episode of This Week , Former Speaker Newt Gingrich told host George Stephanopoulos that Democrats are squarely against the idea. "An amendment was offered in every committee to ... have the members of Congress and their staff in any government option as a mandate. And if this is good enough for the American people, it's good enough for the politicians," Gingrich said. "In every committee, the Democrats voted no. Now, why is it they want to insist on a government-run system for ... people other than the Congress, but the Congress and their staff would be exempt?" We wondered whether Gingrich's vote count was correct. To find out, we sifted through all the health care amendments offered in the House and the Senate committees. Currently, members of Congress receive health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers plans that range from basic coverage to plans that pay for special treatments and drugs. The system has earned high markets for efficiency, making it one of the models the White House has studied in coming up with its own ideas for health care reform. It's important to note that under the Democrats' plan, the public option is just one choice that people would have in the health care exchange. The public option would provide basic coverage, but other plans would offer more extensive coverage likely at a higher price. Under the legislation now pending in Congress, no one would be forced to take the public option. An amendment offered during the House Ways and Means Committee July 16 debate of the bill would have changed all that — but just for members of Congress and their staffs. Nevada Republican Dean Heller offered an amendment that would have required them to take the public plan. His amendment was rejected 18-21, with 21 of the 26 Democrats on the committee voting against it. On the same day, members of the Education and Labor Committee adopted a resolution — code for "nonbinding" in congressional parlance — by Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina that expresses Congress' support that any member voting in favor of the public plan drop his or her federal employee benefits and enroll in the new program. Because the committee approved the resolution by voice vote — meaning members on the panel simply said "aye" or "nay" to express their support for the bill — it's impossible to tell who voted for or against Wilson's amendment. The Energy and Commerce Committee heard a similar argument from Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who wanted to make the public plan mandatory for the president and the vice president as well as members of Congress. But Blunt's amendment never came to a vote because the Democratic leaders panel ruled it irrelevant to the overall bill. Senators have been working on their own version of the health care bill, legislation that only the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has debated so far. On July 14, that committee adopted 12-11 a requirement by Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma that would require all members of Congress to enroll in the public plan. Nine of the committee's 12 Democrats voted against it. That brings us back to Gingrich's claim. He's correct that Democrats in the House and Senate have generally voted against proposals to make the public plan mandatory for members of Congress. Even when Coburn's motion narrowly passed, nine of 12 Democrats voted against it. We can't assess the Democrats' positions on the voice vote in the House education committee or the energy and commerce panel where the motion was ruled irrelevant. So we can't be sure that Democrats voted against it in every committee. But based on the counts that are available, Gingrich's underlying point is correct that Democrats have generally opposed it. So we find his claim Mostly True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2009-08-10T18:22:25	2009-08-09	['United_States_Congress', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03290	"A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/02/don-lemon/educational-levels-generally-make-difference-earni/	Fox political commentator Bill O’Reilly waded into the national conversation on race with a rant last week about what he sees as lingering problems in the black community. During a "Talking Points" segment, the conservative white commentator took aim at the breakdown of the African-American family, drugs and the entertainment industry’s promotion of "gangsta culture." Then CNN anchor Don Lemon took O’Reilly’s commentary a step further. Lemon, in a response that has since gone viral, launched his own rant last weekend during an on-air "No Talking Points" segment. Lemon, who is black, outlined five points for African-Americans to fix their problems, a kind of free self-help session. They included: pull up your pants, respect where you live and finish school. Lemon threw out a couple of statistics to cement his points. So we decided to check out his numbers referenced in his education argument. "You want to break the cycle of poverty?" Lemon says in the rant. "Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money." A lot of money, indeed. Enough money to warrant a check of the facts. The CNN anchor’s rant led immediately to a huge blowback from people across the country, and much of it unfolded on social media. Atlanta political insider-turned MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor even referred to Lemon as a "turncoat" in a series of fiery Twitter posts. Lemon’s opinions are his own and not up for checking. PolitiFact looks at statements of purported fact, not opinions. But what of Lemon’s educational attainment stats? There are several sources that have examined Americans’ earnings by education level. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that weekly median annual earnings in 2012 for a high school dropout were $471; $652 for a high school graduate; and $1,066 for a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate. The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economics think tank, found that the average hourly wage in 2012 for people without a high school diploma was $11.75, compared with $15.78 for high school graduates and $28.28 for college graduates. In 2012, the BLS reported that Americans at private, nonfarm companies worked an average of 34.5 hours per week. Do the math on those numbers, and high school dropouts earned $21,080 for the year; high school graduates, $28,309; and college graduates, $50,734. Several university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor’s degree, $55,864. Over the course of a lifetime, a Georgetown University study found that high school graduates would make $1.3 million, while college graduates with a bachelor’s degree would make $2.3 million. The report, and others, note that occupation, gender, race and ethnicity can influence outcomes. Those influences, along with a tough economy, have caused some researchers to lower the lifetime gap to between $280,000 and $450,000. So, does Lemon’s claim pay off? Depending on what data is collected, how that data is collected and what data set you consider, Lemon’s claim could be correct, or at least within a few thousand dollars for each educational level. But use other data, and his claim could be off by several thousand dollars. Also of note, several factors -- including gender, occupation, age and the economy -- can influence annual and lifetime earnings for workers at all education levels. Still, his overall theme that higher educational attainment equals higher wages seems to be correct no matter which data set is considered. We rated Lemon’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02141	The death penalty "is a deterrent that does affect and impact people."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/06/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-death-penalty-deters-violent-criminals/	Last week reporters, attorneys and state officials watched Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett writhe on the gurney as he was executed. It took nearly 45 minutes, and he eventually died of a heart attack after officials stopped the execution. He’s not alone. Seven percent of all executions by lethal injection are "botched," or not done in line with protocol, according to an Amherst law professor. Each time, the death penalty debate reignites among legislators and the public about executions. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., went on MSNBC’s Morning Joe May 1 to emphasize his support for the death penalty, despite the complication with Lockett’s execution. "I think it is a deterrent that does affect and impact people," he said. "I’ve given a lot of thought. I don’t like it. I wish we put everybody that had such a history as this gentleman behind bars and working and doing things that would help them, but I haven’t changed my position." We decided to check the research to see if Coburn was right that the death penalty is a deterrent. Does the death penalty discourage crime? We found there’s no conclusive evidence to support any viewpoint, including Coburn's. We can’t definitively say that the death penalty deters homicides, increases homicides or has no effect, so Coburn can't back up his point with widelyaccepted scientific evidence. Daniel Nagin, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty. He and his team were tasked with addressing whether or not available studies can prove that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for violent crime. In 2012, he and his team published "Deterrence and the death penalty," a report that sums up more than three decades worth of research: "The committee concludes that the research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates. Therefore, the committee recommends that these studies not be used to inform deliberations requiring judgments about the effect of the death penalty on homicide. Consequently, claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate should not influence policy decisions about capital punishment." Nagin found a few common problems with the existing research: No comparison to deterrent effects of life imprisonment: Study authors often can’t access the data they need from the government. An ideal deterrence study would examine whether people are more deterred by the death penalty than by other serious punishments. No information on would-be murderers’ perceptions: "Deterrence is about how people are responding to their perceptions," Nagin said. Are potential criminals considering their chances of ending up on death row before they commit violent crimes? We don’t know. Statistical flaws: Nagin’s committee determined that the research was so flawed, it couldn’t be informative. However, Nagin said research does show that punishment for crime, in general, is a deterrent. "It’s the certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing consequences, that is the more effective deterrent," he said. The Death Penalty Information Center, The Sentencing Project and other death penalty experts we contacted pointed to Nagin’s report as the most authoritative literature on death penalty deterrence, but there are a significant number of people in the field who side with the studies Nagin and others have criticized. Coburn’s office pointed us toward a 2007 Fox News column by John Lott, founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott defended a group of studies that found that every execution saves 15 to 18 potential murder victims. They’ve been widely criticized for the way they count homicides, mistakes in methodology and making conclusions based on the very small pool of U.S. executions. It could be quite some time before studies produce a widely respected answer to the deterrence question. "The road forward is not easy," Nagin said. Our ruling Coburn said, "I think (the death penalty) is a deterrent that does affect and impact people." Overall, many experts say the existing research has limitations and doesn’t clearly show support for or against the death penalty as a deterrent. So Coburn can't prove his viewpoint is correct. However, executions, along with prison sentences and other punishments for crime, do generally deter criminals. We rate Coburn’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05044	Says as a result of the national health care reform, "the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/11/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-claims-health-care-reform-w/	It didn’t take long after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the health care reform law for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to revive a questionable talking point about the potential savings from the legislation. In the hours following the court decision, the Democratic senator claimed health care reform policies will lower the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next 20 years. "So the reality is the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care," Menendez said in a June 28 interview on the Regional News Network’s Richard French Live. Menendez is correct in his overall point that budget office projections indicate health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But the senator made a couple of mistakes in citing those specific figures, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Our PolitiFact colleagues debunked similar claims by other Democrats in 2010, including one from President Barack Obama. First, let’s discuss the projected deficit reduction in the first decade. The Affordable Care Act and related legislation contain various provisions that affect federal spending in three ways: some policies increase costs; some policies reduce spending; and others generate additional revenues. For the 2012-2021 period, the budget office has projected that there will be more new revenue than new spending, resulting in a net decrease in federal deficits of $210 billion, according to a February 2011 estimate. As of March of this year, that estimate had not been updated. So, the senator is clearly wrong to cite projected savings of "$250 million over the first 10 years." But Menendez made a larger mistake by suggesting the budget office has projected "$1.2 trillion in savings" over the second 10 years. The budget office has not projected any specific dollar figures for that period. The uncertainties are too substantial to create such detailed projections, according to the budget office. The "$1.2 trillion" cited by Menendez is based on the budget office’s estimate that health care reform policies would reduce deficits in that second decade by "an amount in a broad range around one-half percent of gross domestic product (GDP)." GDP is a measure of the nation's economy. However, in multiple reports over the last few years, the budget office has cautioned that this long-term estimate carries a "greater degree of uncertainty." That's why a specific dollar figure has not been projected. In a December 2009 report, the budget office said: "A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great." As the budget office noted in a February 2011 report, calculations for the second decade are based on the assumption that existing provisions remain unchanged, but a number of policies may not be sustainable over a long period of time. "Over a longer time span, a wide range of changes could occur—in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care—that are very difficult to predict but that could have a significant effect on federal health care spending," according to that report. So, Menendez’s "$1.2 trillion in savings" is not based on an exact dollar figure projected by the budget office, but instead on a percentage of GDP, a rough estimate with a "greater degree of uncertainty" attached to it. In response to our findings, Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail: "CBO was asked by members of Congress to provide the out-year estimates for the health care law and that’s what they did. They said their best estimate was .5% of GDP. If you take that estimate and plug in the numbers so that it’s actually easier to understand, you get approximately $1 trillion. That’s the estimate the Senator has used and it’s the same estimate used by the President’s economic team. It’s the estimate he will continue to use." Our ruling In a TV interview, Menendez claimed that, as a result of the national health care reform, "the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care." The senator’s claims contain an element of truth, which is that the budget office has projected health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But Menendez fumbled by citing those specific figures. Over the first 10 years, the budget office is projecting a reduction of $210 billion, not the "$250 million" cited by Menendez. As for whether there will be "$1.2 trillion in savings" in the second 10 years, the budget office has not projected any specific dollar figure for that period. Instead, Menendez’s claim is based on a percentage of GDP that's considered by the budget office to be a rough estimate with a "greater degree of uncertainty." We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-15378	Says Amazon has removed "an educational game about Gettysburg."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/30/newt-gingrich/gingrich-amazon-removed-educational-board-games-ab/	Businesses, like government, are reacting to calls to remove the Confederate battle flag. Walmart announced June 22 that it would stop selling items with the flag. Major retailers quickly followed suit, including giants like Google, Amazon.com, eBay, Etsy, Sears and Target. But some say business has gone too far. Newt Gingrich voiced his displeasure on Meet the Press June 28. Gingrich criticized Amazon for removing "an educational game about Gettysburg, which is used widely in schools to teach people to think." "(The game) has a Confederate versus an American flag, and therefore they've taken the game out of Amazon," Gingrich said. "There's a point here where we begin to get towards Orwell's memory hole, in which we try to hide from the past. I think it's one thing to say you should not have a symbol which is very offensive to a large part of your population. It's another thing to say, 'Let's erase our history and pretend it never occurred.’ " We wondered: Has Amazon removed educational Civil War games in its sweep to stop selling the Confederate battle flag? Neither Gingrich nor Gingrich’s spokesman mentioned the specific names of any games, so we decided to do a bit of digging on our own. PunditFact found several articles that seemed to indicate that Amazon had indeed pulled various board games depicting the Civil War from its online market. An article published on June 25 in the Daily Caller -- three days prior to Gingrich’s claim -- listed several removed games and included links to those presumably missing. These games included Battle Cry, The Guns of Gettysburg and Civil War Stratego, all of which display the Confederate battle flag in one form or another. However, an update to the article on June 26 reads that Amazon had "restored Battle Cry’s listing, though The Guns of Gettysburg and Civil War Stratego remain unavailable." When PunditFact first accessed the article on June 28, all the games mentioned had been restored on Amazon. PunditFact contacted Amazon several times hoping to learn what games had been removed, for how long and why, but did not hear back. Point being: It appears some games were initially removed, according to news articles, but they all since have been restored to the online marketplace. Gingrich spokesman Ross Worthington, who edits Gingrich’s online e-newsletter, said Gingrich misspoke. Gingrich "was referring to Apple's removal of ... apps from the app store," Worthington said. Like other companies, Apple is reviewing apps that contain Confederate battle flag imagery. "(Apple has) removed apps from the App Store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways, which is in violation of our guidelines. We are not removing apps that display the Confederate flag for educational or historical uses," an Apple spokeswoman told CNN. Other articles also reflect that approved apps are in the process of getting restored. Our ruling Gingrich said that an "educational game about Gettysburg" has been removed by Amazon for depicting a Confederate battle flag. From what PunditFact could find, it appears Amazon did initially remove several board games that depicted the flag, but on the day that Gingrich made the statement, all those games had been restored. Amazon and other companies say they intend to remove products that "can promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance" and/or "expose the targeted group to harm or violence." Gingrich’s claim is partially accurate, but also a bit out of date.

pomt-00339	Says "we know" Erika Harold would "discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/17/kwame-raoul/raouls-false-claim-about-opponents-stance-gay-adop/	In his bid to become Illinois attorney general, Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul has sought to cast Republican opponent Erika Harold as too extreme. To that end, he’s run three ads centered on the stance Harold allegedly took against gay adoption in 2000 as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant during a closed-door interview session. "You still won’t believe what Erika Harold believes," a narrator says in his latest one. "We know she'd discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead." "She also supports a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and would even allow employers to fire workers just for being gay," the narrator goes on to say. While those claims also warrant examination, we decided to focus this fact-check on the ad’s first contention because it has become the central focus of Raoul’s argument that Harold’s views are extreme. What’s more, Harold publicly declared months ago that she supports gay adoption and foster parenting, undercutting Raoul’s claim that "we know" Harold "believes" (present-tense) in discriminating against gay couples looking to offer children a home. The allegations on which his claim is based come from a March report by NBC 5 that quoted unnamed pageant officials who recounted the interview session: One of the questions to Harold that year was: If she, like her mother, was responsible to place a child in foster care and had to choose between a.) A loving gay couple or b.) A heterosexual couple who were known child abusers, which would she chose? All three sources told NBC 5 she chose the child abusers. After repeated requests for comment, NBC 5 reported, Harold’s campaign responded with a statement saying she did not recall the exchange but "certainly support[s] same-sex adoption and foster care placement." That’s the same position Harold herself took in multiple media appearances following the story’s release. "I don't remember the specific exchange that was alleged by the anonymous sources," Harold said in an interview with ABC 7 the week after the story ran. "What I do remember is that at the time I would not have supported same-sex adoption, but what I want to make very clear is my position today, which is I strongly support same-sex adoption and same-sex foster parenting." We asked Raoul’s spokeswoman Aviva Bowen to explain how they know for a fact Harold believes otherwise, but Bowen did not provide any evidence that answered our question. Instead, Bowen wrote in an email that Harold’s "‘evolution’ is not credible." "Her statement: 1. comes only after pressed several times by media when the story was becoming public and 2. conveniently contradicts all of her other anti-LGBT views," Bowen added, pointing to Harold’s responses in a candidate survey from the socially conservative Illinois Family Institute, which she filled when running unsuccessfully for the U.S. House in 2014. The questionnaire Bowen referred to asked Harold and other candidates for office about federal legislation important to social conservatives, including gay marriage. Harold’s answers indicated she supported defining marriage as between a man and woman. For the record, a spokesman for Harold said she no longer supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in light of the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling legalizing it. The campaign also says Harold backs the Illinois Human Rights Act, which prohibits employers other than religious institutions from discriminating against an individual for their sexual orientation or identity. "It’s entirely reasonable and common for elected officials to evolve and change their positions on these issues," Harold spokesman Aaron DeGroot wrote in an email, pointing to language used by former President Barack Obama when he embraced gay marriage after previously opposing it. Our ruling Raoul’s ad says, "we know" Erika Harold would "discriminate against a loving gay couple who want to adopt a child, favoring an abusive straight couple instead." That attack refers to something Harold allegedly said nearly two decades ago as a 19-year-old Miss Illinois contestant, according to an NBC 5 report. But the sources who said she took that stance remain unnamed and no one has yet come forward publicly or produced further evidence the comments were made. What’s more, since the NBC story ran in March, Harold has stated repeatedly that although she doesn't recall the long ago exchange, she now "strongly" supports same-sex adoption and fostering. That refutes Raoul’s claim that "we know" she would discriminate against a gay couple looking to adopt. We rate his statement False.

pomt-01179	Female students at UVA "have a 20 percent chance of being sexually assaulted."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/08/richard-saslaw/saslaw-says-20-percent-female-students-university-/	Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw seethed after reading a Rolling Stone article detailing an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. "I can’t remember when I’ve been angrier as an adult, reading that," Saslaw, said during a Nov. 24 meeting with the Falls Church City Council to discuss priorities for the General Assembly session the will begin in January. Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said he will introduce a bill that would require that college officials who are told of a sexual assault to notify law enforcement within 24 hours. "What parent in their right mind would send a daughter to U.Va. when she’s got – are you ready for this? – a 20 percent chance, a 20 percent chance of being sexually assaulted?" Saslaw said in the clip posted by Blue Virginia, a liberal blog. Saslaw spoke more than a week before Rolling Stone backed off the story. The magazine’s editor said last week there were discrepancies in the accuser’s version of events and that the magazine’s trust in her "had been misplaced." Nonetheless, Saslaw’s statement that 20 percent of female students at U.Va are sexually assaulted at UVa warrants examination. The senator, whose daughter graduated from U.Va., told us the figure came from the Rolling Stone article, which says "one in five women is sexually assaulted in college though only about 12 percent report it to police." But the article didn’t say those are the figures are for U.Va. specifically, and for good reason. Let’s take a deeper look: Where does the statistic come from? The Rolling Stone article didn’t cite a source for the one-in-five statistic. But it likely originates from a widely cited study on college sexual assaults conducted in December 2007 by the U.S. Justice Department’s National Institute of Justice. Researchers surveyed 5,446 undergraduate women at two unnamed large public universities -- one in the Midwest and one in the South. The research gained a new wave of attention this year amid a White House push to raise awareness about rape and sexual assault. During an April 29 speech, Vice President Joe Biden said one in five college women are sexually assaulted during their college years. Biden’s office told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that the statement was based on the Justice Department’s findings. The study defined sexual assault as unwanted touching, intercourse, oral sex, anal sex or sexual penetration with an object or finger. Researchers wrote in a Journal of American College Health article in 2009 that 19.8 percent of women surveyed during their senior year had experienced a sexual assault since entering college. But there are some major caveats about the figure. Researchers noted the results were limited to the two unidentified colleges surveyed and may not generalize to the experiences of all college women. They also said the survey had a "modest" 42 percent response rate to their Web-based survey, which the researchers noted is lower than other methods, such as face-to-face interviews. They hoped, however, that anonymity would provide more candid answers and better data. James Fox, a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact National in May that the "one-in-five statistic shouldn’t just be taken with a grain of salt, but the entire shaker." Fox said the issue of sexual assaults on campuses shouldn’t be diminished but faulted the White House for citing national estimates that are "shaky at best." Despite the issues with its methodology, the Department of Justice reached similar conclusions to several other studies on sexual assaults on campuses. In a survey this spring at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 17 percent of the school’s undergraduate women said they experienced a sexual assault -- broadly defined by researchers as "unwanted sexual behaviors involving threats or incapacitation, unwanted sexual touching or kissing, oral sex, sexual penetration or attempted sexual penetration or attempted oral sex." But the researchers found the undergraduates answered the question differently when asked if they had been "sexually assaulted or raped" and were allowed to apply their own definitions to the terms. Under those conditions, 11 percent of the women answered "yes." Since it was a voluntary, non-random survey, the school cautioned it would be wrong to "use these numbers to generalize about the prevalence of unwanted sexual behavior in the lives of all MIT students." In early 1997, the Department of Justice randomly surveyed 4,446 college women and found that 15.5 percent said they had been "sexually victimized" during that school year -- a term that included threats and actions ranging from unwanted touching to rape. The study said that during the course of an undergraduate career, which often extends five years, "the percentage of completed or attempted rape among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter." Research that tries to quantify sexual assaults is complicated by a couple of factors. First of all, it is often an unreported crime. The results of the incidence of sexual assault can differ depending on how the crime is defined. The National Institute of Justice notes on its website that "researchers have been unable to determine the precise incidence of sexual assault on American campuses because the incidence found depends on how the questions are worded and the context of the survey." Despite such limitations, the institute adds that "several studies indicate that a substantial proportion of female students -- between 18 and 20 percent -- experience rape or some other form of sexual assault during their college years." Does the national figure apply to U.Va.? Although the 20 percent is a national number, Saslaw said it applies to U.Va. The senator noted that Rolling Stone reported that U.Va is among 12 universities that has been singled out for an proactive federal compliance review of its procedures handling students’ complaints of sexual assaults. That would "kind of lead you to believe it’s definitely one-in-five there (at U.Va.)," Saslaw told us. "They’re not reviewing all of the colleges across America." But there’s no way to know whether the one-in-five figure actually does apply to U.Va. We asked the university whether it has figures for the percentage of women students who have been raped, but did not receive a direct response. "The national statistics on sexual assaults and sexual misconduct on college campuses are alarming and disturbing for everyone, " U.Va. spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn told us in an email. "UVA is taking aggressive action to address these important issues." U.Va. President Teresa Sullivan, during a Dec. 1 speech, said the university will conduct a survey this spring to determine "how commonly" its students experience sexual assaults. We reached out to David Lisak, a forensic consultant and researcher on sex crimes, about the level of sexual assault at U.Va. and whether the 20 percent national figure that Saslaw cites applies to the college. "Whether these rates of sexual assault apply specifically to UVa is of course an empirical question," Lisak told us in an email. "However, there are by now numerous studies of sexual assault on college campuses, and they are quite consistent in their findings. So one would have to provide some real evidence to argue that the situation at UVa is markedly different than what has been found in national studies." Our ruling Saslaw says a female student attending U.Va. has a 20 percent chance of being sexually assaulted. Saslaw bases his claim on a Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape at UVa that said nationally, "one in five women is sexually assaulted in college." Rolling Stone didn’t cite a source, but the statistic is commonly used and is often based on a 2007 federal survey of women at two unnamed colleges. A few other studies have come up with comparable results. The key fact here is that none of the studies, as far as we know, examined U.Va. The university says it plans to start surveying its students next year to quantify incidences of sexual misconduct. Saslaw applies the 20 percent figure to U.Va. without any hard information and his comment suggests that the statistic is unique to the university. We’re not downplaying the issue of sexual assaults at U.Va., a problem that’s been repeatedly acknowledged by Teresa Sullivan, president of the university. But there’s a burden on Saslaw to prove his claim and he comes up short. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Richard Saslaw	None	None	None	2014-12-08T00:00:00	2014-11-24	['None']
pomt-10886	"If we increase fuel efficiency standards to 40, 45 miles a gallon, we would have to import zero oil from the Middle East."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/22/barack-obama/accurate-but-exploits-misconception-and-uses-unrea/	Obama's Mideast oil claim, made to the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees on June 26, is artful sleight-of-hand. He relies on an extremely optimistic (and possibly unrealistic) notion that the U.S. fleet would average 40-45 mpg at some point in the near future. He does not specify whether he means 40-45 mpg in the equivalent of today's tests (which would mean on-road performance much lower) or if he means on-road. Since he used the testing standard before, we'll assume the same here, which would equate to 35 mpg in the real world. At 35 mpg, Schipper estimates fuel usage could be reduced by about 40 percent. Instead of simply saying it would reduce fuel use by 40 percent, Obama shrewdly plays on the belief by many Americans that the U.S. is heavily dependent on Mideast oil. "Contrary to popular belief, we don't import a lot of oil from the Middle East," said said John DeCicco, a senior fellow for automotive strategies with the advocacy group Environmental Defense. In fact, the U.S. gets less than 20 percent of its imported oil from the Mideast, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. gets almost twice as much oil from Canada than it gets from Saudi Arabia. Obama is correct that a reduction in oil demand because of more fuel efficient cars could theoretically eliminate the need to import any oil from the Mideast. But he ignores the reality of global petroleum markets. "It's not correct to say that we can specify where we buy our oil," Schipper said. "Oil goes into one big world barrel." Obama's comment "if we import zero oil from the Middle East, that means the gas prices are going to go down at the pump" is a bit of a stretch. Given the volatility of oil prices and the time it, the price at the pump might still go up because of other factors. But under his scenario, it would go up less.

pomt-13742	Says Donald Trump "believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders/sanders-trump-would-allow-states-lower-minimum-wag/	Donald Trump is a huge fan of the word "huge." At the Democratic convention, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders relished the chance to turn the word against the GOP nominee. "While Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks -- huuuuge tax breaks -- for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7 and a quarter," Sanders said. Trump’s stance on the federal minimum wage – it’s currently $7.25 – has been a moving target, and we’ve done our best to track it. Sanders’ charge lines up most closely with what Trump said during a May 8, 2016, interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. Host Chuck Todd aimed to clarify Trump’s views. Here’s the key exchange: Todd: "Should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --" Trump: "No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide." So while Trump voiced sympathy for low-wage workers, he rejected the idea that Washington should set a minimum and carried it further to say that states should use the wage "to compete with each other." If Trump had expressed that policy consistently, there would be no debate on his views. But here are other excerpts from Trump on the minimum wage: • In an interview with MSNBC in August 2015, Trump said, "Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country." • During the Republican debate in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are "too high" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, "I would not do it." • On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, "Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?" Trump responded, "Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more." When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, "Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility." Looking at all his statements, we see that most of the time Trump says that he would like to see people earning more than the current minimum wage. But on the separate issue of whether Washington should mandate a hike, he is at best ambivalent, and more often than not, he opposes that. Our ruling Sanders said that Trump believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage. Looking strictly at Trump’s words, at one point, in that Meet the Press interview, he said states should have the right to set their own minimum wage and rejected the idea that the federal government should set it for the country. The only quibble with Sanders’ statement is he talked about what Trump believes, as if Trump’s policy is fixed and steady. It isn’t that simple. Trump suggested in one interview that he might consider raising the federal minimum wage. But most of the time, he has not expressed that view. Nor has Trump said anything recently to clarify his position. Taking Trump’s ambiguity into account, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d3f300b-aebb-4aae-b6a1-8a33626d6a60	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-07-26T00:13:05	2016-07-25	['None']
pomt-06483	"Under Governor Almond the RI DMV had a program that allowed undocumented [people to] use their Personal Tax Identification Number . . . to apply [for] and receive a RI driver’s license."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/16/david-quiroa/david-quiroa-says-rhode-island-has-allowed-illegal/	As controversy swirls over a new policy that lets undocumented students in Rhode Island pay in-state tuition rates at the state’s public colleges, immigrants’ rights advocates are pressing forward on another front: driver’s licenses. To obtain or renew a driver’s license in Rhode Island, the state Division of Motor Vehicles requires drivers to provide valid Social Security numbers. But someone who is living here illegally can’t get a Social Security number or a driver’s license. Foreigners in the country legally -- such as those on valid tourist or student visas -- can submit a letter to the DMV from the Social Security Administration explaining that they don’t qualify for a Social Security number. The DMV will then issue these visitors temporary driver’s licenses for the period during which their visas are valid. Governor Chafee said recently that he is considering changing the state requirements so that people who are living in the country illegally can use taxpayer identification numbers to qualify for a Rhode Island driver’s license. Three states -- Utah, Washington and New Mexico -- allow people who have no Social Security numbers to use taxpayer identification numbers to apply for driver’s certificates, according to the National Council on State Legislatures. (Unlike driver’s licenses, the certificates cannot be be used for purposes of official identification.) David A. Quiroa, president of the Guatemalan-American Alliance of Rhode Island, said in an Oct. 3 news release that during the administration of former Gov. Lincoln Almond, the state Division of Motor Vehicles "had a program that allowed undocumented families . . . to apply [for] and receive a Rhode Island driver’s license . . . " (While Quiroa said "families," we understood him to mean individuals.) We wondered if that was true. Here’s what we found. The history In 2000, a group of immigrants’ rights activists, including Quiroa, met with officials from the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles to find a way for undocumented immigrants to be eligible for driver’s licenses. Quiroa, who was born in New York but grew up in Guatemala, says he proposed the state allow undocumented immigrants to use special tax identification numbers issued by the IRS in place of Social Security numbers for the purpose of getting a driver’s license. The Individual Taxpayer Identification Number is a tax processing number available only to certain nonresident and resident immigrants, their spouses and dependents who cannot get Social Security numbers. The nine-digit number begins with the numeral "9" and is formatted like a Social Security number. Quiroa, who at the time was working with the Center for Hispanic Policy and Advocacy, known as CHisPA, said he argued that letting undocumented immigrants use taxpayer identification numbers would also serve as an incentive for them to pay their taxes -- thereby generating more revenue for the state. Robert L. Carl Jr., then Almond’s director of administration (which at the time oversaw the DMV) said that he supported the idea. "I wanted to be able to track people down,’’ Carl said recently. "I wanted to collect their taxes . . . I wanted them to pay car insurance." The state police, he recalled, also were in favor of the proposal. By May 2002, the DMV had adopted new regulations allowing Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, issued by the IRS, to be used in place of Social Security numbers for obtaining a driver’s licenses. (Applicants for commercial driver’s licenses still had to provide their Social Security numbers.) The wording of the regulations suggests that the division had already been granting driver’s licenses to some residents without Social Security numbers prior to 2002. However, the division’s interim administrator, Lisa S. Holley, could find no earlier record of the DMV’s policy on the matter. The rules remained in force for one year. Then, in May 2003, citing concerns about homeland security and fraud prevention, then-Gov. Donald Carcieri announced that Rhode Island would no longer accept tax identification numbers to obtain driver’s licenses. A state Department of Transportation official expressed concern at the time about the growth in the number of people using tax identification numbers to obtain or renew driver’s licenses, saying that many of them could be living in the country illegally or owe child support to ex-spouses. In March 2004, state Rep. Robert A. Watson, R-East Greenwich, sponsored a bill on Carcieri’s behalf that required the DMV to provide the state tax administrator and court administrator with the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of all drivers within 90 days of their license renewals. The measure was part of a budget article that allowed the DMV to block driver’s license renewals of people who hadn’t paid their taxes. The requirement was incorporated into Carcieri’s fiscal 2005 budget bill, which the General Assembly passed in June 2004, and incorporated into RI General Laws Chapter 31-3-6.1 and 31-3.6.2.). Our ruling Quiroa said that under the Almond administration the DMV allowed undocumented drivers to use their taxpayer identification number from the IRS to obtain a Rhode Island driver’s license. The division’s regulations show that IRS-issued taxpayer identification numbers could be used for this purpose from May 2002 to May 2003. Therefore, we rule the statement True.

pomt-11090	Says Scott Walker "has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money over the course of his tenure."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/15/dana-wachs/how-scott-walkers-rejection-medicaid-expansion-und/	Health care is the most important thing the state does, Eau Claire state Rep. Dana Wachs declared, before launching into an attack on Gov. Scott Walker. "Governor Walker has turned down a billion dollars in Medicaid money over the course of his tenure," Wachs claimed in a WisconsinEye TV interview on April 11, 2018. That’s a reference to additional federal money made available to do a "full expansion" of Medicaid under Obamacare, a law frequently attacked by the Republican governor, who is running for a third term in 2018. Wachs has previously made the $1 billion claim. And it’s likely he or one of the nine other Democrats running for governor will make it again. So, let’s check it. Nonpartisan scorekeeper To back Wachs’ claim, his campaign cited an April 2017 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We confirmed that the memo contains the nonpartisan state agency’s most recent estimates on expanding Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. More governor’s race fact checks: How Walker and the Democratic candidates for governor stack up on the Truth-O-Meter. According to the memo: Had Wisconsin done the full expansion of Medicaid, people earning an income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level would have been eligible for Medicaid. (In 2018, the poverty level is $12,140 for individuals and $25,100 for a family of four.) With that full expansion, Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding that it would be spending an estimated $1.07 billion less in state money on Medicaid, over roughly a five-year period. The estimate is through the current, 2017-’19 state budget cycle, and assumes the state had done the full expansion when it could have in April 2014. In responding to Wachs’ claim, Walker’s campaign did not challenge the $1 billion figure, but offered a statement that said in part: Taking the Medicaid funding under Obamacare would require the state to expand eligibility for Medicaid beyond those living in poverty. The people pushing for Wisconsin to take the Medicaid expansion are really advocating for putting more able-bodied, working-age adults onto a new form of welfare. Walker has also argued in rejecting the full expansion that because of persistent U.S. budget deficits, the federal government eventually would reduce the money available for the expansion, putting a financial burden on states. Partial expansion It’s important to point out that Walker did do what is called a "partial expansion" of Medicaid. As a result of that change, for the first time in state history, essentially everyone living in Wisconsin at the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid. In other words, in Wisconsin, you’re eligible for Medicaid if your income is at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, rather than the 133 percent with the full expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. Walker’s move did push Wisconsinites living slightly above the poverty level off of Medicaid. They in turn became eligible to buy, with federal subsidies, private health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Our rating Wachs says Walker "has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money over the course of his tenure." Leaving aside whether Walker chose good policy or not, his decision not to do a "full expansion" of Medicaid means the state is spending about $1 billion more in state money on Medicaid than if it had accepted additional federal money that would come with a full expansion. With the caveat that the figure is an estimate from the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, covering roughly 2014 to 2019, Wach’s statement is accurate. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13220	"There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-claims-emmys-wer/	Hillary Clinton says that Donald Trump’s favorite defense line if he’s losing is to claim the process is rigged. He’s made the accusation several times so far during the 2016 presidential election. But he also said it when his reality TV show The Apprentice didn’t win an Emmy in 2012, 2013 or 2014. "There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged," Clinton said Oct. 19 at the third and final presidential debate. We decided to examine Trump’s Twitter feed to see what he had to say. In the case of the Emmys, Trump clearly does a lot of whining about not winning. April 29, 2013: "I should have many Emmys for The Apprentice if the process were fair-in any event, it's not my day job." Sept. 24, 2012: " 'Amazing Race' winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility -- no wonder the ratings are at record lows." Sept. 22, 2013: "The Emmys are soooooo boring! Terrible show. I'm going to watch football! I already know the winners. Good night." March 2, 2014: "Which is worse and which is more dishonest - the #Oscars or the Emmys?" Sept. 24, 2012: "The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over." Jan. 14, 2013: "According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys." Sept. 22, 2013: "#CelebApprentice should be part of the Emmys nominations! Pure politics!" That’s a lot of angst. But Trump never directly says the Emmys process is rigged in the way he has characterized the U.S. election system. In most cases, Trump is complaining that politics plays a role in deciding who wins, which is not a particularly surprising assertion when it comes to the selections made by award shows, or by voters trying to decide whom to pick for United States president for that matter. Our ruling Clinton said, "There was even a time when (Donald Trump) didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged." Trump never directly makes that accusation. He calls the system unfair and political, but he doesn’t go as far as to allege that the process is being rigged or tampered.

pomt-09436	"Health insurance companies' costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/12/americas-health-insurance-plans/health-insurers-get-small-percentage-overall-healt/	As the battle over health care reform approaches a climax, America's Health Insurance Plans -- the trade group for the private health insurance industry -- began airing a new ad highlighting statistics on what actually goes into the nation's health care spending. Here's the full text of AHIP's ad: "What's inside the health care cost pie? Some in Washington say it's all health insurance. But health care insurance is one of the smallest slices. Health insurance companies' costs are only 4 percent of all health care spending. Doctors, hospitals, medicines and tests are the biggest slices, and a government report says their rising prices are the primary driver of higher health care costs. If Washington wants to make health care more affordable, they need to look at the whole health care pie, not just a slice." This ad touches on a bunch of controversial and complex issues in just 30 seconds. But for our fact-check, we'll focus on a narrow question: Is AHIP correct when it says that "health insurance companies' costs amount to only 4 percent of all health care spending"? We looked at data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Every year, CMS's Office of the Actuary produces statistics on "national health expenditures" and the items that make up those purchases. That's the source that AHIP cited in the ad, and one that's considered credible by independent experts. The full breakdown for 2008 is posted on the CMS Web site. We'll recap the data here. In 2008, total national health expenditures in the United States -- the combination of money spent by consumers out of pocket, by private insurers and by local, state and federal governments -- exceeded $2.3 trillion. Of that, $92 billion went for the cost of private health insurance. "Cost" in this case refers to overhead and profits -- not to any of the dollars that are funneled through insurers' accounts on behalf of their patients. It also excludes any overhead by government-run insurers such as CMS itself, which signs the checks for Medicare and Medicaid. If you divide private insurance costs by total expenditures, it works out to 3.9 percent -- almost exactly what AHIP said. For comparison's sake, hospitals accounted for 30.7 percent of spending, professional services (including doctors, nurses, dentists and other clinical services) accounted for 31.3 percent, and retail sales of drugs and other medical products accounted for 12.8 percent. To see whether the figures for 2009 changed the equation much, we checked in with John A. Poisal, deputy director of national health statistics in the CMS actuary's office. He said the updated but not-yet-posted numbers were nearly $2.5 trillion in total expenditures and $90.2 billion in insurance costs. That works out to 3.6 percent. Rounded up, that's once again as AHIP portrayed it. Next, we scrutinized the total health expenditure figure. In addition to including such factors as doctors, hospitals and medicines, this amount includes dollars spent on nursing homes and home health care; governmental public health activities; medical research; and medical-related construction projects. Since these items are somewhat extraneous to the costs that AHIP is discussing in its ad, we decided to run the numbers without these factors included. For 2008, insurance costs divided by health expenditures other than those removed above amounted to 4.8 percent. Even when rounded up, 5 percent is close to the 4 percent AHIP cited, and it's a percentage far below what hospitals, doctors and pharmaceuticals claimed. For 2009, the numbers are much the same, working out to 4.5 percent. We weighed whether it made any sense to divide private insurance costs by total private health insurance expenditures -- a number that excludes all expenses paid by the government, by consumers out of their own pockets, and by other private sources, such as foundations. When you make that calculation, the answer is 11.7 percent for 2008 and 11.1 percent in 2009 -- almost three times as high as AHIP's cited rate. Ultimately, though, we concluded that AHIP's numbers more accurately reflect the question it poses. When you're asking what health expenditures could conceivably be trimmed for cost-control purposes, there's no reason to exempt Medicare, Medicaid and other non-private expenditures from consideration. Even if it's correct, not everyone in the health policy arena believes that AHIP's calculation is relevant. Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said "what we should be looking at is the insurer return to capital. ... They make a lot of money relative to what they invest, and they do almost nothing for that money to hold down the growth in health care spending." Meanwhile, some critics suggest that when AHIP points the finger at doctors and hospitals for health care cost inflation, it ignores its own role. Insurers, after all, sign the checks and could presumably use greater leverage to keep costs down. However, our conclusion here doesn't argue one way or another on the question of whether private health insurance could be run more efficiently, whether private insurers should take on a bigger or a smaller role in the health care system, or whether more money should be spent for, say, doctors instead of insurance costs. We are merely checking whether AHIP provided accurate figures to answer the question it raised. And as far as we can tell, the group did. So we rate the claim in AHIP's ad True.

pomt-00405	Says Bruce Rauner is "misquoting newspapers to lie about J.B. Pritzker."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/02/jb-pritzker/pritzker-claims-rauner-misquoted-newspapers-lie-ab/	It’s a common tactic for campaign advertising to highlight selective snippets from newspapers and other media in an attempt to pump an air of credibility into claims and attacks. That time-worn formula is at the center of a recent TV ad by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner that quotes from several papers about Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker, including one from Rockford that declares "the main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes." Now Pritzker is punching back with his own TV ad that accuses Rauner of distorting the quotes he is appropriating. "When you’re a failure, you lie," a narrator says in the Pritzker spot. "Bruce Rauner is intentionally misquoting newspapers to lie about J.B. Pritzker." The dueling ads go down a rabbit hole of election-year politics where there’s now an argument about the argument. Rauner’s ad clearly takes liberties in seeking to paint Pritzker with a broad brush as an advocate of sweeping tax hikes. But Pritzker claims Rauner goes far beyond that by straying into outright fabrication. That’s a provocative charge that invites a closer look. Critical context "The main thing Pritzker wants to do is raise taxes," the first quotation in Rauner’s ad reads, attributed to the Rockford Register Star. "An immediate increase in the current 4.95 percent flat tax rate," the second line goes on, this time from the Champaign News-Gazette. "A short-term plan and a long-term plan to increase income taxes," the next line reads, also from the News-Gazette. Seven quotations later, the ad concludes with its sole original line: "J.B. Pritzker and Mike Madigan. Higher taxes. More corruption." We checked the entire string of cited articles and located the quoted lines in all of them. So it’s clear Rauner isn’t pulling words out of thin air. When we asked Pritzker’s campaign to explain how Rauner erred, spokesman Jason Rubin wrote in an email that the ad "misquotes articles by repeating lines out of context and in a way that misrepresents J.B.’s vision for putting Illinois back on track." For support, Rubin pointed to passages in some of the same articles cited by Rauner that nod to Pritzker’s very different view of his tax stance. Pritzker has said, and the articles point out, that he wants to amend the Illinois Constitution so the state’s current flat-rate income tax can be replaced with a graduated income tax allowing for higher rates on the wealthy — how much, he won’t say. Any such effort would take several years to accomplish, so in the interim Pritzker also says he would raise the current 4.95 percent flat-tax rate but offset the increased cost for low and middle-income taxpayers with expanded exemptions and deductions. It’s a complicated scenario, and Rauner’s ad ignores all the nuance by suggesting Pritzker seeks to raise taxes across the board. That said, the Rauner ad is packed with sweeping condemnations of Pritzker’s tax plan — among them that it "would punish many Illinoisans" — ripped accurately from editorials that unambiguously criticize the Democrat. As we’ve pointed out before, implementing a graduated income tax would not necessarily mean raising taxes on the middle class, despite what Rauner and some of his editorial sources contend. But that doesn’t mean the governor is inaccurately quoting others who make that argument. Pot, meet kettle Pritzker would be on firmer ground had he merely accused Rauner of taking liberties. But there’s a big difference between strategically selecting advantageous lines and putting words in someone’s mouth. And if Pritzker is going to call Rauner out for cherry-picking, it’s also relevant to note that Pritzker does the same in his own response ad. It takes Rauner to task for failing to point out that a Rockford Register Star opinion column he references also mentions Pritzker’s argument that he "only wants to raise taxes on wealthy people." But the overall tenor of the Rockford piece clearly takes a skeptical view of Pritzker’s tax plan, likely why Rauner chose to highlight it in the first place. Kent Redfield, a state campaign expert at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs, called "misquoting" a poor word choice on Pritzker’s part. "It isn’t that Rauner has lied," Redfield said. "One isn’t misquoting and the other quoting accurately. They’re both selectively choosing things that reinforce and lend journalistic credibility to their argument." Our ruling Pritzker’s ad says Rauner "is misquoting newspapers" to lie about him. Rauner’s ad selectively quotes from newspapers — mostly editorials — to reinforce a disputed narrative that Pritzker is out to broadly hike taxes on Illinoisans. In doing so, Rauner leaves out a key point acknowledged in the articles that his ad cites: Pritzker says he only wants to raise taxes on wealthier individuals. The Democrat’s campaign argues this means Rauner’s ad is "misquoting" those articles by taking them out of context. But most of the ad’s driving excerpts come from editorials or opinion columns that share Rauner’s dim view of Pritzker’s tax policies. The position advanced by Rauner’s ad clearly matches the harsher editorials that frame it. While Pritzker’s statement contains an element of truth, it ignores this critical fact. We rate it Mostly False.	None	JB Pritzker	None	None	None	2018-09-02T15:00:00	2018-08-24	['None']
pomt-10899	States "haven't even begun to spend the (election security) money they have now."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/03/marco-rubio/rubio-wrong-states-beefing-voting-security/	Against the backdrop of Russian election meddling, Senate Democrats came up empty-handed in their effort to pump an additional $250 million into election security money for states. The vote was 50-47 in favor, but they needed 60 to bring the measure to the floor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against it. When asked why, he emphasized that Washington just sent the states $380 million a few months ago. "The money we've already appropriated is money that was based on professional assessment of what the needs were from a national level," Rubio told CBS News Aug. 2. "If an additional amount is necessary in the future, we will provide it, but there's no outcry from states saying they need more money. They haven't even begun to spend the money they have now." There’s debate over whether there’s enough money in the pipeline to replace older voting machines and take other steps to harden state systems, but here, we focus on Rubio’s statement that states haven’t begun to spend the money they have now. Key takeaways Washington has sent states $361 million since May for election security improvements. Every state and territory has submitted plans for how they will use the funds. 24 of those plans clearly show that spending is underway in advance of the 2018 election. (Additional states already might be spending funds, but their plans lacked a clear schedule.) 2018 Help America Vote Act Tucked in the $1.3 trillion spending bill President Donald Trump signed March 23 was $380 million for states to make election security improvements. States could replace electronic-only voting machines, set up a post-election audit system to verify final tallies, upgrade computer systems to prevent hacking, and take other measures along those lines. Washington doled out the money by formula, and by April, the Election Assistance Commission, the agency overseeing the process, had sent states letters telling them how much they would get. As soon as states got those letters, they could start spending, so long as they told the commission and the commission gave the thumbs up. The commission told states, "By releasing these funds quickly, it is hoped that the grants can have an immediate impact on the 2018 election cycle." States needed to provide a 5 percent match, but were given two years to do that. They had to submit plans and report how much they spent and on what each year. They had until 2023 to request money, but every state and territory has moved to draw down their allotted funds, with a handful hitting technical snafus in doing that. States are spending now According to plans sent to the Election Assistance Commission, the spending has begun. "We know that at least 24 states have definitely been spending money prior to the 2018 election," said commission director of grants Mark Abbott. "That number may be larger, as some states are deploying funds but did not specify in their plan what years the funds will be used." In Rubio’s home state, Florida’s Secretary of State Ken Detzner approved over $10 million in election security grants to 49 of 67 counties in late July. In June, South Carolina began assessing the vulnerabilities of its voter registration and elections management system. The state has organized a two-day meeting of election officials for August so they can see voting machine options that meet higher security standards. A few days before Rubio spoke, the Illinois State Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center interviewed people for a cybersecurity program manager to work with local election officials. The state’s Department of Innovation and Technology is now hiring nine technicians to conduct risk assessments and training with local election authorities. California has started drawing down about $3 million it plans to spend to strengthen the cybersecurity of its statewide system at the county level. "There’s hiring all over the country to beef up staff," Abbott said. "Other states are buying subscriptions to services to spot malware and filter email. You have to bring people together to make sure everyone at the state and local levels are on the same page, and many states have started doing that." The number of dollars out the door is a small sliver of what the total spending will be. We found about $45 million earmarked for the first year across just four states — Illinois, New York, California and Florida. (The total planned spending is much higher. We were able to glean this figure from states where we could see both how much they planned to spend and when they planned to spend it.) We contacted Rubio’s office for supporting information and did not hear back. Our ruling Rubio said states have "not even begun" to spend the election security money they have now. That is at best an exaggeration and in terms of state activity, factually incorrect. At least 24 states have started spending the recently released federal dollars and just as important, they are signing contracts and making commitments to spend millions of dollars in the coming months. The only element of truth is that states have just begun to spend this new money, and it is a small portion of what has been approved. This is one possible way to understand Rubio’s statement. But if that was his meaning, he could have said so. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2018-08-03T16:19:21	2018-08-02	['None']
pomt-14447	"We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-cleveland-has-higher-rates-lead-po/	The Democratic debate in Flint, Mich., opened with a discussion of the city’s lead poisoning crisis, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Flint isn’t the only place where serious action is needed. "We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate," Clinton said. "We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint. So I’m not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for Flint. I want to tackle this problem across the board." We were curious about Clinton’s claim that Cleveland has it worse. If you stopped listening there, you might have thought she was saying the tap water in Ohio’s second-largest city is also contaminated with lead — which is not the case. Later in the debate, Clinton made a point of mentioning lead coming from other sources, too: "I want us to have an absolute commitment to getting rid of lead wherever it is because it's not only in water systems, it's also in soil, and it's in lead paint that is found mostly in older homes," she said. The Clinton campaign cited an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and we found other reports and data that back her point. Lead poisoning leads to serious neurological and behavioral effects ranging from shortened attention spans and developmental disabilities to coma and even death. While no level of lead is safe in children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference level of 5 micrograms of lead per one deciliter of blood as an indicator of higher-than-usual blood lead levels. According to the CDC, 2.5 percent of American children age 5 and under — about a half million kids — test at this level. Residents of Flint have been consuming tap water with lead since 2014, when the city switched its water source to the polluted Flint River to save money. In 2015, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas had elevated blood lead levels, according to an analysis by Monica Hanna-Attisha, a researcher at Flint’s Hurley Children’s Hospital. Clinton has a point that many other American cities are dealing with the toxin. Lead-contaminated tap water has run through faucets in Washington D.C., Durham, N.C., Lakehurst Acres, Maine, Jackson, Miss. and other places throughout the years. But in most places, lead poisoning elsewhere is mainly due to lead-based paint in older houses. That’s the case for Cleveland, where a whopping 14.2 percent of kids tested at the reference level in 2014, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. In the county, 10.3 percent of kids had elevated blood levels. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County aren’t exactly outliers. Looking at 2014 CDC surveillance data for 1,425 counties in 29 states, 288 counties have higher rates of lead poisoning than Flint. (We should caution that the data is far from perfect; for example, 100 percent of kids in Colfax County, N.M., tested positive, but the sample size was just 33 kids.) What’s more, 15 counties had the same percentage or higher rates of poisoned children as Flint, but at double the reference blood-lead level: Our ruling Clinton said, "We have a higher rate of tested lead in people in Cleveland than in Flint." In Flint, 4 percent of all kids and 6.3 percent of kids in high-risk areas in Flint tested positive for lead poisoning in 2015. In Cleveland, that rate was 14.2 percent in 2014. However, the lead in Cleveland came from paint, not water, and Clinton's initial phrasing made that unclear. With this caveat, we rate Clinton's claim Mostly True.

pomt-07064	Gov. Bob McDonnell launched a "raid on public education to pay for roads."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/28/democratic-party-virginia/democrats-say-bob-mcdonnell-tried-raid-education-p/	David Mills, executive director of the state Democratic Party, recently sent out a fundraising appeal urging party loyalists to take a stand against a variety of efforts by state and national Republicans. Among the alleged GOP offenses, Mills listed "Bob McDonnell’s raid on public education to pay for roads." We wondered if the Republican governor really took money out of classrooms and spent it on roads. McDonnell rolled out an extensive $4 billion transportation plan last December that was approved by the General Assembly earlier this year. Most of the money will come from the acceleration of previously approved state borrowing and the use of bonds backed by the federal government. The governor also proposed diverting $150 million from the state’s 2010 budget surplus into transportation projects. Mills’ claim is based on a second, less-publicized transportation initiative by McDonnell, according to Brian Coy, director of communications for the state Democratic Party. The governor proposed diverting about $140 million in sales tax revenue from Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. The cash, instead of flowing into the state’s general fund, would be used for projects in the two congested regions. The measure died in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Virginia’s general fund -- estimated at $16.5 billion for the budget year starting July 1 -- receives revenue from income taxes, some sales taxes, contract fees, and profits from the state-run liquor stores. Of the proceeds, about 40 percent goes to education, 30 percent to health and human services, and 10 percent to public safety. The rest is divided up among smaller programs. Transportation gets a little from the general fund, but the vast majority of road revenues come from other sources. Because public schools are the largest recipient of general fund money, Coy said the governor’s effort divert more of its revenues to transportation was tantamount to a direct raid on education. If the $140 million had been removed evenly from the various programs the fund supports, schools stood to lose $54 million. That would have been less that 1 percent of the $6.6 billion public education budget for the budget year stating July 1. Of course the General Assembly could also have chosen to cut the $140 million from other programs and leave education untouched. But given that a high percentage of money from the fund goes to education, Democrats say it would be virtually impossible to cut from the fund without taking some education money. The Democrats also cite McDonnell’s successful proposal to move $150 million in surplus money from the fiscal 2010 budget year into transportation. That money could have gone to education, but surplus dollars -- unlike general fund revenues -- are not reserved for schools or other specific programs. Lawmakers spend surpluses as they see fit. Jeff Caldwell, McDonnell’s press secretary, sent us a 106-page list of the services and activities receiving support from the general fund. The inference is that the Democrats are oversimplifying their case when they say moving money from the fund means taking it away from education. Let’s review. Mills, the executive director of the state Democratic Party, says McDonnell tried to "raid education to pay for roads." "Raid" is a loaded word. It suggests a hostile intent on the governor’s part. McDonnell unsuccessfully proposed diverting about $140 million of sales tax revenue a year from the state’s general fund to transportation projects. The money would have come from Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, then spent on road projects in those areas. About 40 percent of the state’s General Fund dollars go to education each year, so if the $140 million were removed proportionally across all programs, schools would have lost about $54 million -- less that 1 percent of the annual appropriation. But the General Assembly, had it approved McDonnell’s plan, could have decided to remove the money from other programs supported. There was no guarantee the money would have been diverted from education. Realistically, it would have been very difficult to remove the cash without impacting education. And McDonnell, in making his proposal, never tried to protect schools from the fallout. We rate Mills’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-10746	"Here's a man who brags about how he made the city safe. It was the Biden crime bill that became the Clinton crime bill that allowed him to do that."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/02/joe-biden/trying-to-out-rudy-rudy/	Expanding the New York Police Department is one of the key things Rudy Giuliani says he did to attack crime when he was mayor of New York. And if adding officers really helped decrease crime there, then Giuliani and his fellow New Yorkers should give Sen. Joe Biden a nice big kiss. Biden was a lead sponsor of a 1994 crime bill that created the federal Community Oriented Policing Services program, or COPS, which was supposed to put 100,000 more officers on American streets from 1994 to 2001. According to records from the Justice Department's COPS office, New York City was awarded enough three-year grants to hire 4,430 new officers from July 1996 to July 2000. It is unclear if all of them were actually hired, how long they stayed, or how many were working for the city at any one time. Giuliani was mayor from 1994 to 2001. Through hiring and merging the city's housing authority and transit police departments into the NYPD, he grew the department by almost 12,000 officers, to a peak of nearly 40,000. The COPS grants that Biden espoused could have supplied as much as 10 percent of the entire force, though experts say that's unlikely. That said, adding cops was was just one of several ways Giuliani and his police chiefs tried to cut crime. They established an innovative crime-mapping program, called CompStat, and targeted small crimes as a way to deter big crimes, as advocated by the Broken Windows theory of policing. And as Giuliani often brags, crime fell by half. Violent crime dropped by 56 percent, and nonnegligent homicide by two-thirds. But as Politifact has reported before, it's a stretch to give Giuliani's policies all the credit. Same wiih Bidens'. First, violent crime rates began falling in New York in 1991, three years before Giuliani took office or the COPS program even existed. Meanwhile, crime rates fell significantly across the nation during the 1990s, including in other big cities. New York wasn't a rarity, it was part of a national trend that remains largely unexplained. In a city of 8-million people, the number of officers provided by COPS was barely a handful, said Jeffray A. Fagan, co-director of the Center for Crime, Community and Law at the Columbia Law School in New York. He's studied the city's crime trends for years. "Whether the size of the force produced crime declines at the margins above the secular trend that was underway starting in late '91 is a hard question, but the consensus among social scientists is that the marginal effect is small," Fagan said. Several studies also have failed to show a correlation between Giuliani's policies and the drop in crime during his mayorship. Rather, experts say, better policing techniques likely combined with other factors, including a break in the crack cocaine epidemic, changing demographics and an improving economy. So if Giuliani can't take all the credit, neither can Biden. We find his attack Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2007-11-02T00:00:00	2007-10-30	['Bill_Clinton', 'Joe_Biden']
pomt-00947	UW-Madison "spent down reserves" as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has "no more reserves to spend down."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/20/rebecca-blank/scott-walkers-300-million-budget-cut-looming-uw-ma/	The $300 million Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison. "We can't handle this," UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. "It's not good for the university. It's not good for the state. These are simply too big." We’ve established that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker’s 2015-’17 state budget. There’s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent. But what about the effect on UW-Madison, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)? At a Feb. 12, 2015 public meeting on Walker’s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament. "As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut," Blank said. "So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down." We’ll check both parts of Blank’s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison "spent down reserves" as it was told to, and now it has "no more reserves to spend down." The reserves backdrop Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in reserves. In fact-checking a claim by the system’s president at the time, we found the amount was roughly in line with some comparable university systems. Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged. The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so. "Spend down" The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama’s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so. There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves. But, in effect, there was. The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-’15 state budget. They responded swiftly, instituting a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets. The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other. The UW System’s most recent assessment of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier. Reserves left The second part of Blank’s claim is UW-Madison has "no more reserves to spend down." That’s an overstatement. Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as "designated," "planned" or obligated" -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. But Blank herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school describes as discretionary reserves -- "fund balances not already committed to payments." In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That’s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget. On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker’s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn’t zero. Our rating Blank says UW-Madison "spent down reserves" as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has "no more reserves to spend down." With rhethoric and actions taken with the 2013-’15 state budget, Walker and the Legislature made it clear to UW-Madison and other UW System campuses that they needed to tap their reserves. And UW-Madison did. But Blank, objecting to even larger cuts in state aid now being proposed by Walker, goes too far in saying UW-Madison has no reserves, given that, at a minimum, $54 million in "discretionary reserves" are available. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-12516	"Back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/25/donald-trump/did-terrorism-not-exist-nato-was-created-donald-tr/	President Donald Trump has needled NATO, the 68-year-old military alliance, as an anachronistic vestige of the Cold War with a low-energy approach to fighting terrorism. "Back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism," Trump said in a wide-ranging interview with the Associated Press which published an interview transcript April 24. We previously rated False Trump’s suggestion that he’d caused NATO to take a sharper focus on terrorism. This claim is a bit different, but it’s still problematic. We found that while Trump’s claim isn’t literally true, it implies important questions about how NATO has adapted to new threats. While defining terrorism can be a bedeviling task -- as we’ve previously pointed out -- the concept of terrorism certainly existed before NATO’s founding in 1949, said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "Acts that we would today define as terrorism began as early as the anarchist offenses of the late 19th century and the campaign against the Russian czars of the mid to late 19th century," he said. And the 20th century saw several "overwhelming examples that indicate the extent of President Trump's error," said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a University of Notre Dame law professor. Transnational terrorism arguably started World War I when an unlawful Serbian independence organization known as Black Hand assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she said. "Indeed, the problem was so bad that the League of Nations worked for many number of years on a comprehensive treaty against terrorism but did not succeed prior to World War II," she added. World War II saw terror tactics used widely, O’Connell said, prompting the explicit prohibition on the use of terror as a weapon under the the Geneva Conventions in 1949 -- the same year NATO was founded. Directly rebutting Trump’s claim is the fact of widespread terrorism in 1949 when the alliance was born, according to Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. "Terrorism goes back centuries, and in 1949 was raging in many places around the world," Janda said, "from Algeria to Palestine, and from India and Pakistan to Malaya, to name just a few." So Trump is wrong when his statement is taken literally. But Bromund said Trump’s broader point that NATO is an aging alliance has merit. "NATO was not founded to combat terrorism, was not created in a world where it was even a minor concern, and was not structured to oppose it in any way at all," he said. "Even when terrorism did become a concern in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s, NATO remained dedicated to deterring, and preparing to fight if deterrence failed, state-on-state war." Given NATO’s original mission of deterring a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, it’s ironic that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 -- and not a traditional interstate conflict -- is the only event in history to trigger the alliance’s collective security obligation, said military historian Janda. "9/11 is the only time the alliance has invoked Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which calls on member states to defend other alliance countries after an attack on any one of them," Janda said. "Ironically, it saw the alliance come to help the United States, rather than seeing the Americans sally forth to fight for Europe, as was generally assumed would be the case in the event of war." Also worth noting is the nature, targets and instruments of terrorism have evolved dramatically since NATO’s birth in 1949, said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. Ratner described non-state terrorism as having evolved in two distinct waves since NATO’s founding, with the first beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s with the rise of violent radical-left movements like the Red Army Faction and pro-Palestinian groups like Black September. The second wave began with the post-9/11 groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS. Recent developments under these latter groups include suicide bombings, the expanded use of transportation targeting, and the internet as a means of communication and recruiting, Ratner said. "Both of those waves were different from anything done before because of their brazen willingness to attack civilian targets and the sophistication of their operations," Ratner said. Our ruling Trump said, "Back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism." In the most literal sense, Trump is wrong -- terrorism had existed in one form or another long before the creation of NATO. But it's worth noting that the tactics and the potential reach and scale of terrorism has expanded in the years since NATO was founded, and the alliance has had to shift its focus somewhat in recent years toward terrorism rather than state-on-state conflict.

pomt-11615	In one year, the United Nations "did 24 resolutions and 20 of them were against Israel."	false	/florida/statements/2018/jan/25/ron-desantis/fact-checking-rep-ron-desantis-claim-about-uns-tre/	Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., went head-to-head with an audience member after he criticized the United Nations’ treatment of Israel in the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency. "I don't know really what they do other than attack Israel," DeSantis said during a Jan. 11 event at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization. "In that year, they did 24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel." An unnamed person in the audience objected to that point after the speech, saying it "was very disgraceful and sad that you said something as an elected official that's blatantly not true." The man offered another statistic for anti-Israel resolutions and told DeSantis to "double-check your facts." "I will. This stuff been widely reported," DeSantis said. "I don’t think it’s much up for dispute." PolitiFact Florida wanted to see about that. DeSantis was referring to a more narrow count of resolutions from the U.N. General Assembly, and not the U.N. system. That’s important to know, because the United Nations adopted hundreds of resolutions in 2016 — not just 24. A closer look at resolutions against Israel Any United Nations body can issue a resolution, which is a formal text or statement. But the most resolutions are issued by the Security Council or the General Assembly. The 15-member Security Council is the only body of the U.N. that can pass binding resolutions, which member states are required to implement under the U.N. Charter. The council can pass economic sanctions and launch investigations and peacekeeping missions. For example, the Security Council adopted resolution 2397 in December 2017 in response to Pyongyang's Nov. 29 ballistic missile test. It established sanctions against North Korea that restricted fuel imports as well as the ability of its citizens to work abroad. Then there’s the U.N. General Assembly, comprised of all 193 member states. Unlike the Security Council, General Assembly resolutions are non-binding and do not carry any legal force on member states. Some resolutions take public policy stances on serious issues and conflicts, while others are less significant. Resolution 71/124 desiginated May 2 as World Tuna Day. Resolution 71/4 appointed Mr. António Guterres as U.N. secretary-general. Parsing Desantis’ evidence: A partial look of 2016 DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick said he was referring to resolutions passed during the 71st session of the U.N. General Assembly from September 2016 to September 2017. But the Assembly adopted about 330 resolutions during that time. So where is DeSantis getting his information? Fusick pointed to an analysis by UN Watch, a pro-Israel watchdog group that monitors criticism by the United Nations of the Jewish state. UN Watch’s analysis does not pertain to all of 2016, however. It only looks at resolutions passed in the last two months of 2016. In that timeframe, the UN Watch analysis showed the General Assembly adopted 20 resolutions that "singled out" Israel. In contrast, only four other resolutions were adopted condemning other nations: one each against Ukraine and Iran, and two about Syria. In a subsequent December 2016 story, UN Watch added two more resolutions against Syria and North Korea. The General Assembly resolutions against Israel are largely symbolic. Elliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that a 2017 General Assembly vote against Israel was followed by no concrete steps in an issue brief. So why adopt them at all? Michael Koplow, Israel Policy Forum's policy director, said the resolutions are an easy way for Arab and Muslim states to indicate their opposition to Israel and also single out the United States. Whether the specific resolutions that are critical of Israel are justified is not something we will evaluate in this fact-check However, we will note that there are conflicting opinions on whether some of those resolutions should count as "anti-Israel." Koplow pointed to UN Watch's inclusion of resolution 71/126, which he said does not "single-out" Israel. Instead it welcomes humanitarian assistance and economic aid for Gaza, and reiterates multiple times the need for the Palestinian Authority to be in charge of implementing development projects rather than Hamas. Security Council measures against Israel are rare The situation is reversed for resolutions passed by the powerful Security Council. Mainstream news reports in December 2016 did mention the Security Council’s resolution 2334, which condemned Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories as "constituting a flagrant violation under international law." The vote was significant, because the United States abstained from the vote. For this reason, the U.N. Security Council was able to adopt the resolution — which usually doesn't happen. "Israel is shielded from critical resolutions for the most part, because of the United States," said Louis Charbonneau, the director of the United Nations program at Human Rights Watch. A single vote from one permanent member on the Security Council can veto a resolution. Charbonneau said the United States has a history of vetoing resolutions that are critical of Israel, especially under the Trump administration. For example, in December 2017 the United States blocked a Security Council vote on a resolution that directed all states to stop building diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. This point explains the audience member’s issue with DeSantis. After calling DeSantis out for lying, the audience member said that the U.N. adopted 76 resolutions, and only one was related to Israel in 2016. He was referring to the number of resolutions passed by the Security Council in 2016. Our ruling DeSantis said the United Nations spent one year doing "24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel." These numbers are wrong. The United Nations' General Assembly passed hundreds of resolutions in the year-long 2016-17 session — not two dozen. DeSantis was apparently trying to repeat a watchdog group's findings that 20 of 24 (and then 26) General Assembly resolutions against other countries, over a few months in 2016, were against Israel. But his sweeping public comment contained no trace of those clarifications, and he doubled down on his statement at the event. His effort to boil down a complex system into a sound bite doesn't check out. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01254	"The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/12/scott-walker/scott-walker-obama-visit-failed-boost-democratic-t/	National conservative talkers hailed Gov. Scott Walker as a "rock star" and a "genuine hero" after the Republican won his third statewide election in a row -- the latest coming two years after Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin handily. On Nov. 7, 2014, Walker told one of those fans, syndicated TV and radio host Sean Hannity, that he did it despite Obama’s pre-election visit to Milwaukee’s central city. "The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there," Walker said of Democrats. Before the details of Walker’s win begins to fade away, let’s check his claim that Obama couldn’t boost the Democratic turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 election, in which Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke. On Oct. 28, 2014, Obama joined Burke, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Milwaukee at North Division High School in the heart of the city’s predominantly African-American north side. The rally for Burke drew an overflow crowd estimated at 3,500, and Obama lightheartedly pleaded with attendees to back Burke. "Grab your friends, and grab your coworkers, and grab the lazy cousin who’s sitting at home, never votes during the midterm elections," the president said. "He’s watching reruns of old Packer games. Just grab him up. Take all of them to cast their ballot, and cast their ballot for Mary Burke." The high school is a voting site (Ward 143) on Election Day, and Walker was right that in the 2012 presidential race Obama won 99 percent in that ward amid turnout that -- following historical patterns -- was larger than in non-presidential years. The crowd at North Division was the biggest of the campaign season for either side and appeared to energize Democrats, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. But on Election Day, did Obama’s urging work? Digging into the claim Walker didn’t specify what election he was comparing to the turnout in the Nov. 4, 2014 contest. It could have been the 2012 presidential race. Turnout then was much higher compared to the 2014 governor’s race. But the most logical starting point is the most recent governor’s race. That would be the June 2012 special election, prompted by the recall drive that followed Walker’s surprise move to sharply curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. Walker seemed to be focused specifically on that one ward. And, indeed, turnout in Ward 143 was down 9 percent from June 2012. If you look at city turnout overall, it’s the same story. In June 2012, turnout topped 73% of pre-registered Milwaukee voters, reflecting the intensity of a race that riveted the state for months. More than 223,000 Milwaukeeans voted in that race, with three-fourths backing Barrett. The tally of those in Milwaukee who voted Democratic in the recall race was 171,150. In the 2014 Walker-Burke race, that number fell to 156,167. What if you go back to the 2010 governor’s race, which also pitted Barrett and Walker? That was the last regularly scheduled governor’s race, so the dynamics are more comparable. The results are mixed. Ward 143 (then known as Ward 109, before maps were redrawn after 2010) produced a higher Democratic vote for governor in 2010 than in 2014. So, by that measure Walker is on the money. But the citywide Democratic turnout in 2014 the turnout was higher than that in 2010. Burke drew 13 percent more Milwaukee votes in 2014 than Barrett did in 2010. Our rating Walker said: "The president of the United States came in the Tuesday before the election in a ward that went 99% for him in the last election and they couldn't even (increase) the vote there." The numbers back him up: turnout in that ward -- and citywide was down, and so were the votes for Democrats in 2014 when compared to the most recent governor’s race, the 2012 recall. Turnout also was down in that ward compared to the 2010 turnout in Walker’s first race, though citywide it was higher in 2014 than four years earlier. We rate his claim True.

pomt-00041	Says Ohio U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot "voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati’s own Children’s Hospital."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/house-majority-pac/did-steve-chabot-vote-take-health-care-away-kids/	The House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, released a new ad criticizing Republican congressman Steve Chabot’s record. Chabot is locked in a tight race with Democratic challenger Aftab Pureval to claim the seat in Ohio’s 1st Congressional District. The ad says Chabot "voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati’s own Children’s Hospital." The ad’s text, in full: "While they shouldn’t have to worry, some kids can’t escape it. But Steve Chabot voted to cut health care for kids, affecting up to half the families at Cincinnati’s own Children’s Hospital. The insurance industry that gave Chabot’s campaign over $700,00 got their way. Just like they did when Chabot voted to rollback protections for pre-existing conditions. Steve Chabot listens to them, not us." So did Chabot actually vote to deny health care to kids? And would it have impacted around half of the patients at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital? We wanted to find out. It is accurate Chabot voted for the GOP-backed American Health Care Act, though the bill didn't pass. If passed, the measure would have rolled back provisions from President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, including protections for people living with pre-existing conditions and cuts to Medicaid, on which many poor children rely. About half of the patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center are covered through Medicaid. But we don't know how many children specifically would have been affected. The American Health Care Act and Steve Chabot In 2017, Steve Chabot voted to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act. The House Majority PAC noted that Chabot’s vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act, the GOP-backed plan to overhaul Obamacare. The measure narrowly passed the house with a 217-213 margin before it failed in the Senate. Along with leaving it up to states how much of the ACA should be overturned, the AHCA would have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare, but also would have rolled back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covers millions of low-income children. Potential impacts on children enrolled in Medicaid More than 35 million children are enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, constituting the largest group in the program, although they represent a smaller share of expenditures compared to other groups. In Ohio, Medicaid covers two in every five children. The AHCA would have altered Medicaid’s financing, ending the current federal-state partnership and converting the program to a per-capita or block grant starting in 2020. Following the House vote on the bill in May 2017, research released by Avalere Health, a Washington D.C.-based healthcare consulting firm, estimated how much child health could be threatened if Medicaid faced the changes laid out in the bill. The organization found that, nationally, children’s Medicaid would get hit with reduced funding of $43 billion over 10 years under a per-capita cap model, with reductions in spending becoming more dramatic each year. The Affordable Care Act also raised Medicaid’s minimum income eligibility limit for children from 100 to 138 percent of the poverty line. This was done in the 34 states, including Ohio, that expanded Medicaid under the ACA. It allows children with families incomes below 138 percent of the poverty line, regardless of age, to be covered by Medicaid. The AHCA plan would lower the eligibility level back down to 100 percent of the poverty. Would half the children at Cincinnati’s Children Hospital be affected? It's unclear. The House Majority PAC refers to a WCPO Cincinnati story in which a doctor at Cincinnati’s Children Hospital, Dr. Ray Bignall, said that the bill would have hurt children because of its cuts to Medicaid, on which poor children rely. He also said that about 50 percent of the young patients at the hospital are covered through Medicaid. The hospital is similar to other Children’s hospitals across the country, which depend on Medicaid funding as half of the patients at these institutions are also enrolled in the program. Because these hospitals need the money to keep operations afloat, losing covered benefits and enrollees could lead to decreased revenues and ultimately shrink the types of services the hospitals are able to provide children, regardless of their insurance. Chabot’s campaign told us that the WCPO story is about the Senate version of the bill, not the House version, and that the House bill "did not treat Medicaid the same way." In the same story, Dr. Bignall also is quoted saying, "The cuts are essentially just as deep as they were before. It seems that this is a core element of the legislation that isn't going anywhere." It is true that there were changes in the Senate bill, but both versions would have ultimately phased out the extra money the federal government provides to states as an incentive to expand Medicaid eligibility, and both would put the program on a budget, ending the open-ended entitlement that now exists. Several analyses have found the House bill’s funding plan would lead to extensive shortages in every state, but the Senate version would deepen long-term Medicaid cuts even further. Our ruling The House Majority PAC says Chabot voted to take away children’s health care, impacting about half of the kids at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital. It revolves around Chabot’s vote for the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which was estimated to have reduced $880 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years, a program on which millions of poor children rely. If the House (or Senate) version of AHCA had passed, the financial restructuring of Medicaid could have resulted in severe cuts to the program, and thus, children losing health coverage. But the exact impact on patients at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital is unclear, and Chabot's vote wasn't specific to the hospital. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06036	Says a drug test can be performed for "just $4 or $5."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/13/stacey-campfield/state-senator-says-price-tests-would-be-low-benefi/	State Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, wants drug testing for individuals seeking government-related benefits, and he said in an interview that costs of testing, to be paid for by the applicant, should not be expensive. "It’s not going to cost that much, just $4 or $5, if it’s limited to hardcore illegal drugs." We wondered if a drug test that can withstand legal scrutiny can be purchased so cheaply. Research backs up Campfield’s claim, and reliable tests can actually be had even more cheaply. But figuring the state’s tab and actual costs for such a program is not as simple as running a price check on individual drug tests. Administrative costs and potential re-tests of individuals who test positive could raise the actual price tag. In the interview, Campfield acknowledged there would be other costs but said the savings from having fewer people on the government dole will more than offset them. Still, we wondered just how expensive such a program would be. First, a little background. Campfield said he plans to push three bills calling for drug testing: one dealing with persons on welfare, one for those drawing unemployment compensation and one for those receiving workers’ compensation benefits. One state that recently tried something similar, Florida, had only 32 people fail the test and 1,600 refused to take it, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The cost to the state has been substantial. Then U.S. District Judge Mary Scriven issued an injunction against the law in October. The state is appealing. Campfield said he is aware of the Florida situation and plans to avoid its pitfalls. A big one: the state was on the hook for the $25 to $45 each test costs if the individual passed. Campfield’s measure would have the applicant assuming the cost regardless. His test would not cover prescription drugs -- the biggest area of abuse in Tennessee but also a legal hot potato because of the thousands who take prescription drugs legally. For Ron Hanaver, director of the Knox (County) Drug Court, drug testing is a key tool, so we asked him if drug tests could be had for $4 or $5. His emailed response: "Those tests can, in fact, be tested for about that price. We are currently using a 5-panel test that tests for opiates, cocaine, THC, and 2 other drugs for about $3.50." American Screening Corp owner Ron Kilgarlin says his company offers a five-panel test for $1.63 apiece, but Hanaver describes five-panel tests as "instant ‘dip’ tests" that "are not 100% accurate." Hanaver says that failures of those tests may mean administering a backup, known as a "gcms test," but what he calls "non-negative" tests needing the backup occur only about 2 percent of the time or less. Kilgarlin says those "gcms" tests usually run for $25 apiece but could be reduced to $14 apiece for a big enough client. And, what other costs are there? A report put out in October by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation office in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services looking at various costs of programs aimed at drug testing recipients of government benefits. It lists many areas: purchasing the drug tests, laboratory fees, staff time to administer the test, staff time to monitor compliance and eligibility, staff time to deal with increased administrative hearings, modifying facilities to accommodate the testing, modifying computer programs to include drug testing in eligibility, substance abuse treatment, hiring a contractor to administer the test, legal fees if the law is challenged. A table included in the report looks at the expected costs of programs offered by the 12 states that are considering such programs (or, in Florida’s case, have instituted). Those estimates range from $20 million in New York to $92,487 in Louisiana. Count Hanaver, the Knox County drug-court director, among those skeptical about keeping costs low for a statewide program that tests benefit recipients for illegal drug use. "When you talk about doing drug screens on a state-wide scale, the cost would be huge," he says. Campfield clarified to us that he was referring just to the cost of the individual tests, and believes the legislation will result in the state saving a substantial amount of money, not spending more. He said the savings would come from not paying benefits to people who test positive - or who don’t apply for benefits knowing they will test positive. Once the bill is filed, legislative staff of the state’s Fiscal Review Committee will do a fiscal note estimating costs to the state. Our Ruling Campfield’s claim that initial five-panel tests for illegal drugs can cost $5 or less is accurate, although it is unclear how other costs, for things like re-testing and administration, could affect the ultimate per-person cost of each individual test. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Stacey Campfield	None	None	None	2012-01-13T15:18:15	2011-12-21	['None']
pomt-13829	"Over the last six years, the state of Illinois spent about $320 million on illegal immigrants."	true	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/14/bill-mitchell/illinois-spent-millions-covering-illegals/	Illinois state Rep. Bill Mitchell, R-Forsyth, repeatedly slammed a three-year extension of the state’s Expanded All Kids program that was passed in the Illinois House in April. While arguing against the bill, Mitchell claimed that All Kids has spent a fortune on covering illegal immigrants with taxpayer dollars. "The latest (All Kids) audit said, over the last six years, the state of Illinois spent about $320 million on illegal immigrants," he said in April. All Kids is a health insurance program run by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services that offers comprehensive health care to thousands of children in the state. Expanded All Kids is the portion of the program that covers poor families and undocumented children. As of the 2013-14 fiscal year, the program had a total enrollment of 52,075 children under the age of 19, of which 30,441 were classified as undocumented. All Kids has faced criticism over the years for its coverage of undocumented immigrants as well as for allegedly being more expensive and providing less coverage than originally anticipated. We decided to investigate Mitchell’s claim about health care spending on undocumented immigrants. Looking at the numbers Source: IL House GOP Mitchell’s claim is based on several audits of All Kids conducted by William Holland, the Illinois auditor general at the time. The latest available report was released in February 2016 and covers health care costs up until 2014; there is no data available for fiscal year 2015. Mitchell’s office told PolitiFact that his comment was referring to the amount of money spent between 2009 and 2014. A press release provided by the office stated that, "none of these costs were matched by the federal government. Illinois taxpayers paid the entire cost for these non-citizens." We examined the audit reports to break down the costs of health care associated with undocumented children in Illinois each year. FY 2009: $54.9 million FY 2010: $59.2 million FY 2011: $58.8 million FY 2012: $55.7 million FY 2013: $48.7 million FY 2014: $42.3 million The total costs of health care during the time period add up to approximately $319.6 million, which matches Mitchell’s claim. The audit reports also list the costs of services by each category. For example, in the 2013-14 fiscal year, dental services cost $12 million, or around 17 percent of that year’s total costs. We reached out to the Auditor General’s office and to All Kids for information on how much was spent on undocumented children for each category of health care. We’ll add this information if we obtain it. The All Kids program confirmed the accuracy of the figures in an email, but did not offer comments on Mitchell’s claim. How do the yearly costs of health care for undocumented children fit into the overall state budget? The 2014 Illinois budget was $67 billion. The General Revenue Fund, the part of the budget that contains discretionary spending, was approximately $31 billion. The amount of money spent on undocumented children through the Expanded All Kids program translates to roughly .136 percent of discretionary spending for that year. Are there hidden benefits to the program? One question worth exploring is if granting health insurance to undocumented children carries any hidden economic benefits that Rep. Mitchell didn’t account for in his claim. The health care and immigration experts we interviewed said that health care programs often partly pay for themselves over long periods of time. First, the children receive direct benefits from being covered, such as decreased mortality and a higher chance of attending college. Additionally, the state may receive long-term economic benefits. A recent preliminary study concluded that, "the government will recoup 56 cents of each dollar spent on childhood Medicaid by the time these children reach age 60." However, this study was conducted on the federal level, and doesn’t specifically examine undocumented children. Matt Notowidigdo, associate professor of economics at Northwestern University, told us that hospitals in Illinois often already cover the uninsured without receiving compensation, and may actually benefit from Expanded All Kids. "If undocumented immigrants already consume a lot of health care in our hospitals but often don't pay for that care, then one can view this program as helping out hospitals financially," he said in an email. It’s hard to use this research to judge Mitchell’s claim because of how specific and small the Expanded All Kids program is. We found no research directly discussing any economic benefits that Illinois would receive from the program. Our ruling Mitchell claimed that the state of Illinois spent $320 million on health care for illegal immigrants over the past six years. The state’s independent audit reports on the All Kids program from 2009 to 2014 support his claim. There’s no direct evidence or research that shows Mitchell failed to mention any important unseen benefits of the program that would significantly change the context of his argument. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4d4a7426-9799-4b8c-b03e-f42335c0c171	None	Bill Mitchell	None	None	None	2016-07-14T12:11:54	2016-04-20	['Illinois']
pomt-05435	"Just on Jan. 1 of this year, there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day."	false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/27/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-40000-new-laws-were-put-books-first-/	Campaigning in his home state of Texas, Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul told a crowd at Texas A&M University that he thinks the country is moving in the wrong direction. In addition to saying that the nation has "too much tyranny," the Lake Jackson congressman criticized the number of people behind bars, saying he doesn’t think that’s a reflection of how "bad" Americans are. His explanation: "I think we have way too many laws on the books is what I think. Just on Jan. 1 of this year, there were 40,000 new laws put on the books in one day." Paul went on to say that he would like to be the first president to "get rid of 40,000 laws," following up with a verbal walloping of the daily-published Federal Register, where proposed and new regulations are listed. He called the publication incomprehensible and said it should be shrinking, not growing. We wondered whether Paul was correct about the number of laws that went into effect on the first day of 2012. A quick Google search led us to the likely basis of such a figure. In a Dec. 27, 2011, press release, the National Conference of State Legislatures said U.S. states and territories passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law in 2011. Yet, the release also said, laws do not always take effect at the start of a year. When we inquired about Paul’s statement, campaign spokesman Gary Howard told us he thought Paul "was including regulations found in the Federal Register." That seemed a possibility given the next part of his remarks. If so, though, Paul’s count was way off. James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us that typically, the number of federal regulations put in place in a single year — and not all at the start of each year — ranges from 3,000 to 4,000, all of which are published in the Federal Register. Susan Dudley, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center who served as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President George W. Bush, concurred with Gattuso’s figure. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Federal Register’s website that lists the number of new and proposed rules by year, starting in 1976. The 2011 total was 3,807. According to the data, the 1970s and 1980s were the high mark for regulations, when the total number of rules put in place were in the 6,000s and 7,000s. Dudley said those figures represent the most comprehensive statistics on federal regulations, big and small, from agencies throughout the government. Adding the number of proposed rules doesn’t bring the total much closer to 40,000. In 2011, according to the data, there were 2,898 proposed rules, for a new and proposed regulation total of 6,705. And, again, that’s for the whole year, not a single day. What if we include the number of federal laws effective Jan. 1, 2012? We didn’t find an easy way to count the number of federal laws, if any, that went into effect then. Some legislation that is signed by the president specifies a future date that it will become effective while others take effect as soon as the president signs them. Also, the impact of some laws is not felt until a federal agency issues corresponding regulations. However, there’s no indication that the number is anywhere close to 40,000. According to the White House website, President Barack Obama signed into law eight pieces of legislation in the nine days before Jan. 1, 2012, including a major appropriations bill and one that included a two-month extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. Also, the Congressional Record of Jan. 3, 2012 says that in the previous 12 months, about 80 bills had become law. State legislatures, meanwhile, were much more active. The National Conference of State Legislatures’ news release, noting that "laws do not always become effective on Jan. 1," detailed some that did. A taste: Laws requiring businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States were set to go into effect in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia, according to the release. Also, same-sex couples in Delaware and Hawaii earned the right to enter into civil unions. In a telephone interview and via email, Meagan Dorsch, a conference spokeswoman, told us that the group’s researchers based its 40,000 figure on data they keep themselves through bill tracking, though they did not pin down exactly how many of those 40,000 pieces of legislation became effective the first day of 2012. Another hitch: We noticed that the 40,000 total includes both bills that have passed into law and resolutions, which often lack the significance of statutes. In its glossary of legislative terms, the NCSL defines a resolution as a document that "expresses the sentiment or intent of the legislature or a chamber, that governs the business of the legislature or a chamber, or that expresses recognition by the legislature or a chamber." A snapshot: In 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed 129 concurrent resolutions sent to him by lawmakers, ranging from one memorializing the late Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr. to another instructing a clerk to make technical corrections to Senate Bill 1420, which had to do with the Texas Department of Transportation. We asked Dorsch for a breakdown of the 40,000 figure by resolution and bill. She said the group did not separate bills from resolutions in making its count. Finally, we found two other entities with information on state-level bills passing into law. The Council of State Governments, based in Lexington, Ky., publishes data on the number of bills and resolutions that states enact each year. Information for 2011 isn’t ready yet, but for some perspective, we checked out 2010. Corralling only bills enacted by state legislatures and not vetoed by the governor, we counted 14,227. A couple of notes on these figures: First, five states, including Texas, didn’t have regular legislative sessions in 2010. Second, setting aside enacted resolutions may overlook some that have the force of law or would be considered substantive, like proposed constitutional amendments. If resolutions approved during 2010 regular and special sessions are included in our count, the total rises by about 13,000 — to 27,240. A note about these figures: The council had no information on resolutions for seven of the states that held regular sessions in 2010. Finally, we enlisted StateScape — a research firm in Alexandria, Va., that says it collects every measure introduced by state legislatures. Chad Robinson, the firm’s research director, told us by email that its data shows that legislatures enacted 18,562 bills, excluding non-statutory resolutions, in 2011, a year when all state legislatures convened. That’s less than half of 40,000. And it could even be that states are starting to approve fewer new laws. Robinson said by telephone that according to the firm's data, more bills passed into law in the previous two odd-numbered years when every state legislature was in session -- 20,238 bills passed into law in 2009 and 21,031 bills passed into law in 2007. Our ruling Our sense is that Paul’s figure originated in the NCSL press release saying that legislatures in 2011 passed more than 40,000 bills and resolutions into law. From the top, Paul's reference is a little misleading, considering that he was stumping for federal office and followed his statement by railing against the Federal Register. Clarification is needed. Most significantly, it looks like 40,000 proposals did not pass into law, not in all of 2011 and certainly not on a single day, contrary to Paul's statement. Also, it looks like many of the proposals were non-statutory resolutions. We rate Paul's claim as False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-04-27T16:12:36	2012-04-10	['None']
pomt-12639	"Immigrants are responsible for 96 percent of our small biz growth since 2000."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/28/jim-kenney/philly-mayor-draws-incorrect-immigrant-biz-stat-fl/	Immigrants are the drivers behind a large segment of small business growth in Philadelphia. But how large? Mayor Jim Kenney pegged it as the vast majority yesterday. It’s Immigrant Business Week in Philly, and while commemorating the week’s launch, Kenney tweeted: "Kicking off Philly's first Immigrant Business Week! Immigrants are responsible for 96 percent of our small biz growth since 2000. #PHLimmigrantbiz." This figure was sourced from a city fact-sheet on immigration and sanctuary cities. But here’s the thing: Both the tweet, and the fact-sheet from which it was drawn, are incorrect. After inquiries from PolitiFact Pennsylvania, a city spokeswoman called it "mistake that we'll be correcting." The fact-sheet cited a 2015 Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce report, which itself was referencing analysis produced by the Fiscal Policy Institute: immigrant business owners accounted for 96 percent of Main Street business growth in the city from 2000 to 2013. In that same time span, immigrant entrepreneurs represented 18 percent of Philadelphia’s small business growth overall. What are Main Street establishments, exactly? The research, which was co-produced by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, uses it as an umbrella term for the following categories of businesses: "neighborhood services," like salons and laundromats; "accommodation and food services," like taverns, restaurants, but also inns; "retail" including a wide range of shops. According to Pew, immigrants make up 13 percent of the city population. With an 18 percent share of small business growth, foreign-born entrepreneurs are more prone to open new businesses than their counterparts, and overwhelmingly so when it comes to opening Main Street businesses. "This is not something unique to Philadelphia. It’s something we see nationally," explained Kate Brick, who edited the Fiscal Policy Institute and Americas Society/Council of the Americas report. Main Street establishments may be more attractive to this demographic, she added, because they pose a "lower barrier of entry to starting a new business." The report, which described these mom-and-pops as "less capital intensive" and "small-scale" also noted: "Immigrants often get a foothold in this country by opening small businesses in run-down areas, which also have immigrant residents. A Dominican, Kurdish, or African immigrant may have a better sense of what their compatriots in the area would like to buy in a grocery or clothing store, or what would entice them to a restaurant." In 2013, 28 percent of Main Street businesses were immigrant-owned. As Billy Penn has reported, while millennials get much of the attention, immigrants are fueling Philadelphia’s population boom. That’s one reason why local immigrant business growth has been so impressive. Another, the report noted, are the city’s support through programs out of the Mayor’s Office and Office of Immigrant Affairs, as well as partnerships with organizations like the Welcoming Center. Further, foreign-born residents have played a heavy hand in rejuvenating commercial corridors like the Italian Market, which has become popular for Latino and Southeast Asian business owners in recent decades, and North Fifth Street. That corridor was once dominated by shop owners of German ancestry more than a half century ago, but it's now the cultural nerve center of the Barrio. After PolitiFact PA contacted representatives for the mayor, Kenney retweeted his earlier message with a new note that the figure was referring to Main Streets specifically. Since 2000, immigrants were responsible for 96% of Philly’s Main Street small biz growth. Get the facts: https://t.co/5Igw5ytfZM https://t.co/wDP8u0rybw — Jim Kenney (@PhillyMayor) March 27, 2017 Our Ruling Kenney originally tweeted that "immigrants are responsible for 96% of our small biz growth since 2000." This is not true, and his office, after PolitiFact Pennsylvania made them aware of the error, has since acknowledged that. We rate this claim False.

pomt-15074	"Just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia. They operate at a loss."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/22/mary-mannix/mary-mannix-says-about-half-virginias-rural-hospit/	Hospital officials from across Virginia flocked to Richmond last week to air concerns about tightening revenues at their facilities. Among them was Mary Mannix, president and CEO of Augusta Health, a rural hospital in Fishersville about 90 miles west of Richmond. Mannix said her facility is on solid financial footing but that many other rural hospitals are not. "Just about half of rural hospitals operate in the red in Virginia," Mannix said at a news conference organized by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, a lobbying group. "They operate at a loss." The struggles of rural hospitals across the nation have been well reported in recent years. Facing declining population bases and tightening Medicaid reimbursements, many have struggled to remain open and some have shut down, including Lee Regional Medical Center in Southwest Virginia in 2013. Many hospital officials hoped the General Assembly would ease the stress by expanding the state’s Medicaid program to reduce the medically uninsured. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the federal government would pay all of the costs of expanding the program through 2017 and at least 90 percent in the future. Republican lawmakers have blocked the expansion and say Uncle Sam can’t be trusted to pay his promised share. The debate is sure to continue when the General Assembly convenes in January. The hospital association says it will lobby lawmakers to find solutions to financial problems at hospitals -- although what solutions, the group isn’t saying. In the past, the association has backed Medicaid expansion. So we wondered whether Mannix was correct in saying "just about half" of Virginia’s rural hospitals are running in the red. We reached out to Lisa Schwenk, a spokeswoman for Augusta Health, to find the source for Mannix’s statistic. Schwenk referred us to Julian Walker, the spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. Walker sent us a hospital association chart showing that 17 of 37 rural hospitals in Virginia -- or 46 percent -- had operating losses in 2013, the latest year data are available. The chart listed basic "acute care hospitals" - facilities where people get care for illnesses and injuries. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitative or other specialized medical centers. The underlying information for the hospital association chart comes from Virginia Health Information, an independent, non-profit group that contracts with the Virginia Department of Health to provide information on the cost and quality of health care in the state. The group releases an annual report looking at the operating margins of all hospitals around the state. Michael Lundberg, executive director at Virginia Health Information, sent us a link to the group’s database showing the fiscal 2013 financial results for the hospitals. It lists 36 rural hospitals, 17 of which had a negative operating margin. That comes to 47 percent. In this database, the hospitals were allowed to determine for themselves whether they should be classified as rural or urban. Lundberg also sent us a second batch of data in which hospitals were sorted as rural or urban based on definitions from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This grouping listed 25 rural hospitals in 2013, 16 of which ran in the red. That comes to 64 percent. By comparison, Lundberg’s figures show that of the 60 urban hospitals in Virginia under the federal definition, 13 had operating losses. That means nearly 22 percent of urban hospitals in the commonwealth had an operating loss in 2013. Our ruling Mannix said about half of the rural hospitals in Virginia are operating at a loss. Figures from the group that tracks hospital finances back her claim and suggest, if anything, her estimate is on the low end. We rate her statement True.

pomt-15083	"The cost of fire in Rhode Island is anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/sep/20/kenneth-block/ken-block-sees-smoke-how-big-fire/	Ken Block is the former candidate for governor who strongly believes Rhode Islanders are paying far too much for an army of firefighters. In March, Block and his organization, Watchdog RI, released a research project that detailed the cost of firefighting in the state and compared costs here to other parts of the country. Block is proud of that work, and during an appearance on WPRI’s "Newsmakers" on Aug. 23 he said: "When we studied firefighting costs in Rhode Island relative to other places, we determined that the cost of fire in Rhode Island is anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find." In fact, Block told us his statement to "Newsmakers" had actually understated the difference, based on his latest review of the numbers. But it was also clear that the type of source information needed for a full vetting of Watchdog RI’s determination would not be forthcoming. More on that later. First, we needed to understand more about those percentages that Block used when he said Rhode Island was 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive. He said he had used them to convey the range of differences between the more expensive firefighting costs in Rhode Island and less expensive costs in other areas of the country that the Watchdog report analyzes for comparison purposes. Watchdog RI did not compare Rhode Island with every other community in the country. Far from it. The report compares Rhode Island’s firefighting costs with costs in some huge cities that Block acknowledges do not make good comparisons with Rhode Island. It also compares Rhode Island costs with costs in some areas that Block says match up well, especially when juxtaposed, not with Rhode Island as a whole, but with the eastern portion of the state. The Watchdog RI report calls this region Metropolitan Rhode Island because its population and land area is suitable for comparison with other urban areas in other states. The report also provides a per-capita fire cost for for Metro RI and also for Rhode Island as a state. Both figures, the $350 per capita for Metro RI and $315 for the state as whole, were for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2014. Both figures were based on the cost of 66 different fire departments and fire districts, as reported in responses to Watchdog RI’s information requests or in financial documents, according to Block. Both the $350-per-capita figure and the $315 exceed per-capita spending amounts in each of the 10 communities that Watchdog RI’s report compares to Rhode Island. Per-capita spending in Miami was the closest. Metro RI came in at 35 percent more expensive, according to Block. At the other end of the spectrum, Metro RI came in at 180 percent more expensive than Orange County, Florida. When comparing Rhode Island as a state, Block also found Rhode Island’s costs were 41 percent more than New York City and 116 percent more expensive than Los Angeles. We went online and checked out the financial reports that Block cited as his source for firefighting costs in other places and Block appeared to be in the ballpark. But Block did not provide the same type of source material that he gave for the 10 communities outside of Rhode Island to back up his claim about the costs of firefighting in Rhode Island. Watchdog RI’s report posted on its website has no appendix or footnotes. Block told us he was unwilling to spend the time needed to go through the budgetary information that his team had gathered, nor could he give us citations for that information. That would take more than 40 hours, he said, adding that it was time he did not have on the heels of a reporting effort that had consumed 500 hours. So we were on our own. And although we were unwilling to check in with all 66 Rhode Island fire districts, we did look at the adopted fire department budgets of the state’s five largest cities: Providence, Warwick, Cranston, Pawtucket and East Providence. The total amount of budgeted spending for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2014, came to $121.9 million. And the total population for the five cities added up to 460,984 people. This created a per-capita fire cost of $264 for Rhode Island’s five largest cities. That’s significantly less than Block’s per-capita spending amount for Metro RI of $350, but it still exceeds per-capita spending amounts in other areas that Watchdog RI selected for comparison. Before you put too much stock in these comparisons, consider this: Block says he suspected the Rhode Island numbers did not include pension costs, which are a major line item. Therefore, we removed pension costs for the five Rhode Island cities we looked at. But for the comparison communities, we discovered that spending that he cited for Orange County and Miami did include pension costs; $12.6 million in Orange County and $23.7 million in Miami, but the Los Angeles number did not. It’s a muddle. Put simply, we’re not sure Block is comparing apples to apples. And Block, as an aside, told us he wasn’t sure the spending calculation for Providence included health-care expenses. Our ruling On "Newsmakers," Block said: "When we studied firefighting costs in Rhode Island relative to other places, we determined that the cost of fire in Rhode Island is anywhere from 33 percent to 100 percent more expensive than anywhere else we could find." However, the determination itself isn’t that reliable without an appendix and without consistent data, especially in regards to pension costs. Perhaps, Block and his team should just finish their reporting job. For those reasons, the judges rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10331	"Sen. McCain's economic plan gives nearly $4-billion in tax breaks to the oil companies but doesn't provide any tax relief to more than 100-million middle-class families."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/23/barack-obama/something-for-the-middle-more-for-the-top/	With energy prices continuing to weigh on Americans' wallets and psyches, Sen. Barack Obama's campaign is stepping up efforts to portray Sen. John McCain as a politician more willing to help big oil companies than consumers. Responding to a McCain television ad seeking to direct anger over rising gas prices at his opponent, the Obama campaign issued a point-by-point analysis that noted, among other things, that the five largest U.S. energy companies would profit handsomely under McCain's economic plan, which would reduce corporate tax rates and allow expensing for some investments. "Sen. McCain's economic plan gives nearly $4-billion in tax breaks to the oil companies but doesn't provide any tax relief to more than 100-million middle-class families," Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said July 18, 2008. Though that makes a handy sound bite, Obama's campaign is conveniently picking from among the corporations that would benefit from McCain's plan, while ignoring some of his tax proposals directed at individuals. Obama's campaign derives the "nearly $4-billion" figure from an analysis of McCain's plan by the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank headed by John D. Podesta, former President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. We examined that one previously and found that while the nearly $4-billion claim was right, Obama's overall point was Barely True. In fact, McCain's plan would lower the tax rate on all corporations, not just big oil companies. By focusing on how the proposed tax cut would help a handful of energy giants, Obama's camp makes the plan look like a special-interest package exclusively tailored to the largest energy producers. Obama's campaign also distorts the McCain plan's effect on individuals. Though independent analyses of the income tax provisions have generally concluded McCain's plan would most benefit wealthy Americans, it has provisions that would help individuals with lower household incomes. Chief among these is a proposed increase to the exemption taxpayers may claim for each dependent — currently $3,500 — by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016, after which it would be indexed for inflation. Under the McCain plan, married couples that file a joint return reporting adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less would be eligible for the $7,000 exemption immediately. So clearly, middle- and lower-income households with children would receive above-average tax cuts. McCain also would raise and index for inflation the threshold for the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a separate income tax that was intended to ensure that people did not use loopholes to avoid paying taxes but that has been ensnaring more and more middle-income Americans. Congress in recent years has extended the AMT exemption for a year or two at a time so that so large numbers of taxpayers don't become subject to the tax. Congress is almost certain to enact another temporary "patch" covering the 2008 tax year. But McCain would permanently extend the AMT exemption, index it for inflation and allow individuals to claim personal nonrefundable credits against the AMT. How much this would help middle-class families largely depends on how you define middle class. The Tax Policy Center says it would primarily benefit more affluent households in the 80th to 95th percentile of income — those earning between $111,645 and $226,918 in 2008 dollars, were McCain's plan to be fully phased in next year. Still, households with more modest means would not be subjected to the AMT under McCain's proposal. McCain would also extend President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010. Those cuts collectively reduced top marginal tax rates on individuals' incomes, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, expanded the child tax credit and reduced taxes on married couples compared to singles. The Tax Policy Center says McCain's policy proposals collectively would reduce the tax exposure of 60 percent of all American households, though fewer than half of those making between $18,981 and $37,595. The analysis backs up Obama's broad contention that McCain's tax policy is weighted to give the largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. However, it's wrong to say McCain's plan would provide no relief to middle-class Americans. Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers' AMT exposure. For this reason, we rule the Obama campaign's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-07-23T00:00:00	2008-07-18	['None']
pomt-07933	"The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense. That's 84 percent of the federal budget."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-84-percent-budget-social-security/	The public needs to accept that there are no easy solutions to the nation's budget crisis, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Jan. 23, 2011. "The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense," Conrad said. "That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. "So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way." Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012. It's true that people don't like the idea of cutting Social Security or Medicare. A CNN poll recently found 78 percent said Social Security should be protected from significant cuts, and 81 percent said Medicare should be protected. The picture was mixed for defense, with 49 percent saying it could be cut and 50 percent saying protect it, a statistical tie. We also checked Conrad's statement that we borrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend in a separate fact-check. We wanted to check Conrad's numbers on the budget, particularly his statement that Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget. That number seemed alarmingly high. As we dug into the numbers, though, we found a few discrepancies that needed explaining. We began our calculations by looking at the current budget. If you add up defense spending, Medicare and Social Security, that currently equals 51 percent of spending. Add in spending on veterans, and it rises to 54 percent. (Add it up for yourself using the White House's budget tables.) We ran this number by two budget experts who confirmed it for us. We contacted Conrad's office, though, and a spokesman said that Conrad's point was that it is very hard to cut the budget if you're only willing to look at discretionary spending, which is the money that Congress appropriates every year. If you leave defense spending out, you're left with an even smaller piece of the pie, which budget wonks call non-defense discretionary spending, which is 16 percent of the budget. (In Washington, people will even abbreviate non-defense discretionary spending to "NDD.") It's basically the easiest part of the budget to cut. Conrad was talking about the hard part: the mandatory spending programs, plus defense spending. And he short-handed mandatory spending to just Social Security and Medicare, which are the largest two programs in the category. And while it's true that Social Security and Medicare are the largest part of mandatory spending, they are not all of it. Mandatory spending includes other entitlements -- benefits people have a right to under the law if they meet the requirements. That means programs like Medicaid, food stamps, welfare, child nutrition care, the children's health insurance program, supplemental security income, veterans pensions, a portion of the costs of health care reform and refundable tax credits for low-income workers. You have to include those other programs to get to 84 percent. Strictly speaking, Medicare, Social Security and defense spending only make up 54 percent of spending. In rating Conrad's statement, his numbers are definitely off. Social Security, Medicare and defense spending are not 84 percent of the budget, they're closer to 54 percent. Conrad may have known what he was talking about -- just the manadatory spending -- but we're not sure the average listener would. Still, his overall point is correct: Medicare, Social Security and defense represent huge parts of the budget, more than half, and it's difficult if not impossible to balance the budget if these three items are off the table. That's enough to tip the balance on our ruling; we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-10066	"We've added, in the last eight years, $4 trillion of debt to the nation's obligations."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/22/rahm-emanuel/5-trillion-added-national-debt-under-bush/	We know the public debt has grown dramatically during the past eight years. Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama's White House chief of staff, pegged the increase at $4 trillion recently. Emanuel appeared on Meet the Press the Sunday before Obama took office and was asked about Obama's spending plans and whether he was concerned about adding even more to the national debt. Emanuel began by pointing out that the national debt increased significantly during the Bush administration, then he defended the need for a stimulus bill to help the economy. "Actually, there was a surplus at one time, and now we've added, in the last eight years, $4 trillion of debt to the nation's obligations," Emanuel said. Emanuel was actually using two different ways of talking about the budget. We'll explain. The federal government creates a budget every year. When it spends more money than it takes in, it runs a deficit. When tax revenues run higher than expenses, that's a budget surplus. At the end of the Clinton administration, there were several years of budget surpluses. But those surpluses were not enough to compensate for the previous deficit years. So the government still carried what's called the national debt. (For more detail on these concepts, check out this "Frequently Asked Questions about the Public Debt" Web page put together by the Treasury Department.) Here, we wanted to look at Emanuel's claim that during the past eight years we've added $4 trillion to the national debt. Is it that much? Turns out, it's even more than that. Emanuel didn't mention the Bush administration specifically, but that's what most people think of when they think of the last eight years. So we decided to check the national debt from when Bush took office to when he left. When Bush took office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left, it was $10.7 trillion. That's a difference of $4.97 trillion, almost $1 trillion more than what Emanuel said. But the debt has shot up significantly during the past few months, mostly due to the economic meltdown of 2008 and the government's efforts to shore up the federal banking system. As recently as Sept. 18, 2008, Emanuel would have been correct with the $4 trillion number. You can check out all these numbers for yourself via the Treasury Department's debt history search application . So what does the Truth-O-Meter say when someone is off by $1 trillion? As we've said with our policy on statistical claims , "to assess the truth for a numbers claim, the biggest factor is the underlying message." So even though he is off by about 20 percent, the fact that the number has been surging lately supports his point that the debt increased greatly under Bush. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00586	"Fox News barely covered (the Duggar family) scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/05/brian-stelter/brian-stelter-fox-barely-covered-dugger-scandal-un/	It’s been a big week for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, chosen by the famous Duggar family of TLC’s 19 Kids and Counting to exclusively air their side of the story involving the oldest Duggar son molesting five minors, including his sisters, a decade ago. But to some observers, Fox’s intense promotion of Kelly’s June 3 interview with parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and her later sit-down with two daughters molested by Josh Duggar marked a drastic shift in the network’s coverage of the story. "It’s slightly amusing that Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview," said CNN senior media correspondent and Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter on June 2. "Now they’ll be covering it a lot more." We wanted to double-check Stelter’s analysis. Was Fox News essentially mum about the story until Kelly scored the at-home exclusive? Stelter told PunditFact that he first started thinking about the coverage disparity when he saw a story by liberal site Media Matters for America that compared light coverage by Fox with intensive coverage by MSNBC and CNN. He and CNNMoney media reporter Tom Kludt did their own research and reached a similar conclusion for a story about the interview. "Along with the amount of time spent, we took into account the type of Fox's coverage," Stelter said. "Early on, the mentions of the controversy were fleeting, not substantive at all." The controversy went public when In Touch Weekly published the first story May 19 about Josh Duggar being the suspect in a 2005 underage sexual abuse investigation. In Touch and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published more stories May 21 based on a police report that said the father did not go to law enforcement until a year after the fondling incidents took place. After the stories appeared, Josh Duggar resigned his position as executive director of the Family Research Council and apologized in a statement, saying, "Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation." TLC pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting the next day, May 22. Fox first told its viewers about the situation in a 30-second segment on May 22, followed by a 20-second segment on May 23. On May 26, the Duggars were mentioned on The Five in the context of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee defending the family. "You don’t go around defending the Duggar family when you’ve got bigger issues going on," said pundit Greg Gutfeld. Fox analyst Howard Kurtz criticized the media’s focus on the Duggar family in a May 24 segment. Those are the only references we could find before May 30, when Kelly’s interview was announced. Needless to say, those mentions of the story were super-brief — especially when you compare how the other networks handled it. CNN and MSNBC anchors devoted considerably more time to the controversy from the start. We used Critical Mention, which searches closed-captioning transcripts, to look for mentions of the Duggars on the three networks from May 19 to noon on May 30, roughly when the interview was announced. This method isn’t perfect — misspellings aren’t captured, for instance — but it does provide a rough snapshot of how often each network discussed the family. Fox News personalities mentioned "Duggar" four times. Within the same timeframe, the family name came up 99 times on CNN and 72 times on MSNBC. On Stelter’s home network of CNN, the story was brought up on five different shows on May 22, with Erin Burnett OutFront and Anderson Cooper 360 devoting substantial chunks of air time to interviews with an In Touch staffer and child psychiatry professionals, as well as going into other TLC shows with stars that fell from grace. CNN Tonight host Don Lemon continued to explore the story in his May 26-28 shows. On MSNBC, nearly every show on May 22 talked about the story, including hosts Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, Al Sharpton and Chris Hayes, often bringing in experts to dissect some of the story’s finer points. The network continued to cover the story on May 26, 27 and 28. Fox began to report the story in more depth on June 1, when Kelly criticized the media’s handling of the story with Fox media analyst Howard Kurtz. She equated the rush to cover the story as feasting on a carcass, going after CNN specifically for bringing up how GOP presidential candidates had taken pictures with Josh Duggar before the scandal broke. Kelly’s coverage of the story has also focused on the release of police records, which she and the Duggars say should have never been made public. Other shows on the network, including The O’Reilly Factor, Outnumbered, Your World and Fox and Friends, started talking about the Duggars in the context of Kelly’s interview. From noon on May 30 to about 5 p.m. on June 5, there have been 134 mentions of "Duggar" on Fox, according to Critical Mention. Fox News spokespersons did not offer comment for the story. Our ruling Stelter said, "Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview." Our review of media mentions of the Duggar story among CNN, MSNBC and Fox supports his statement. Fox News’ coverage was fleeting before Kelly’s interview was announced. We rate his claim True.

pomt-03663	New Virginia regulations on abortion clinics "provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/28/susan-b-anthony-list/susan-b-anthony-list-says-says-new-virginia-regula/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe’s opposition to stricter regulation of abortion clinics has drawn fire. Women Speak Out Virginia, a PAC affiliated with the Susan B. Anthony List that seeks to end abortion, is airing a radio ad that criticizes McAuliffe for opposing what it said are "common ground abortion center health and safety standards." "McAuliffe refuses to require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices and hospitals," the narrator says. We were well aware that controversial regulations approved by the Virginia Department of Health on April 12 will require abortion clinics to adhere to the building standards for hospitals. Proponents said the new rules would make abortion clinics safer; opponents said the regulations were a ruse to put the clinics out of business. But this is the first time we’ve heard the claim that the rules would require the clinics to provide the same sanitary standards expected of dental offices. So we decided to see if this is the case. We asked Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the PAC and the Susan B. Anthony List, for proof of the ad’s claim. She provided no facts. "We -- meaning Virginia women -- expect a safe, sanitary environment inside abortion clinics, places that should be regulated at least as strict as dental offices and in fact, even stricter -- like hospitals -- which are mentioned immediately after that," she wrote in an email. The ad implies that prior to the new regulations, abortion clinics were allowed to operate at lower sanitary standards than dental offices. There’s no evidence to support that. They were treated pretty much the same. Before the change, neither abortions clinics nor dental offices were regulated by the Virginia Department of Health, according to Erik Bodin, the department’s director of the office of licensure and certification. The doctors and dentists were under the purview of the Virginia Department of Health Professions, which licenses medical practitioners. The department only inspected the cleanliness of a physician’s or dentist’s office if there had been a complaint. In the case of a dentist’s office, an inspector would be required to fill out a form evaluating the cleanliness of the facility, the disposal of needles, the sterilization of equipment and surfaces. The findings are sent to the Board of Dentistry, which can revoke the license of a dentist who endangers public welfare. Up until the rule change, abortion clinics were regulated under the general category of "physician’s offices." The Board of Medicine does not have specific regulations regarding sanitary standards in a doctor’s office, according to Diane Powers, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Professions. The board looks into complaints and may revoke licenses of physicians who provide "an unsanitary office environment," Powers said. So what’s changed under the new regulations? Nothing for dental offices. But it’s a whole new world for abortion clinics, which now fall under the Department of Health. The clinics will have to meet certain building standards for new hospitals regulating the width of hallways, the number of parking spaces, the number of air exchanges used in a procedure room to keep infections from spreading and the type of hand washing sinks used by medical staff. Each clinic is required to have a plan for preventing infections that complies with guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each facility will be inspected by the state Department of Health at least once every two years. Our ruling A PAC affiliated with the Susan B. Anthony List says in an ad that McAuliffe opposed new regulations that would "require women’s health clinics to provide the same sanitary environment we expect of dental offices." McAuliffe did oppose new regulations that were approved for abortion clinics earlier this month. But it is ridiculous to imply that these rules elevate the sanitary standards for clinics to those of dental offices. Abortion clinics will be held to hospital building codes, must comply with with federal guidelines for infection prevention and will be inspected at least once every two years. Dental offices do not have to meet any of these guidelines and will continue to be inspected only in response to a complaint. Without any evidence, the PAC has launched a misleading ad that trivializes very significant and polarizing changes Virginia has made to the way it regulates abortion clinics. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Susan B. Anthony List	None	None	None	2013-04-28T17:09:50	2013-04-23	['None']
pomt-09102	"For six years, I served our community as a conservative state legislator. In every one of those years, I helped balance the state's budget."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/22/clay-cox/congressional-candidate-clay-cox-says-he-helped-ba/	Patriots, take notice. Clay Cox wants to convince you that he's the man who can fight the move toward what he labels as "socialism" in the U.S. government. A rousing campaign mailer lists the 7th Congressional District candidate's credentials. It says Cox has "real-world" experience balancing budgets, both as a successful businessman and a state representative: "For six years, I served our community as a conservative state legislator. In every one of those years, I helped balance the state's budget." So Cox helped balance the state budget? Well, of course. So did the state's 235 other legislators. The state Constitution requires the Legislature to balance the budget. Consider Article III, Section IX, Paragraph IV: "The General Assembly shall not appropriate funds for any given fiscal year which, in aggregate, exceed a sum equal to the amount of unappropriated surplus expected to have accrued in the state treasury at the beginning of the fiscal year together with an amount not greater than the total treasury receipts from existing revenue sources anticipated to be collected in the fiscal year, less refunds, as estimated in the budget report and amendments thereto." Put more simply: "Unlike the federal government, the state of Georgia has a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget," said Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. If the budget isn't balanced, the spring legislative session doesn't end, said Katherine Willoughby, a professor of public management and policy at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. If the budget goes out of balance during the course of the fiscal year, the governor must call a special session. "There's no way for them [legislators] to get around doing their job," Willoughby said. Any legislator who participated in the session helped balance the budget. And unlike elementary school, there's no award for attendance in Georgia politics. The Cox campaign counters that his participation in the state budget process shows that he has the toughness to avoid tax increases in the face of dwindling government revenues. Still, avoiding tax increases wasn't the accomplishment Cox makes it out to be. He and other legislators didn't cut enough spending for state government to pay for itself. Cox was among those who voted for a fiscal 2011 state budget with almost $13 billion in federal funding, according to a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The budget was balanced, in part, by shifting the burden to the U.S. government. Cox's claim was misleading. Not only did he leave out the crucial fact that balancing the state's budget is a legislator's duty. He and his colleagues "helped" pass a budget that's reliant on money from the federal government, which is deep in debt. In effect, Georgia's in the black thanks in large part to the deficit spending Cox rails against. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01764	"Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/30/charlie-crist/florida-women-make-83-cents-ever-dollar-man-makes-/	Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist has started outlining what he wants to change about Florida, and he’s starting with how much women earn. "Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes," Crist said in a campaign email sent out July 29, 2014, the same day he announced his First Day of Fairness plan. The plan outlines a series of executive orders Crist promised to make on his first day in office if he is elected. The potential orders promote causes like government transparency, raising the minimum wage among businesses contracted with the state, and, in this case, ending gender wage discrimination for employees of those contractors. PolitiFact has checked many claims about women making less than men, especially the past few years. Is Crist right about them making only 83 cents on the dollar in Florida, or is he short-changing voters? Time to check the paychecks. Measuring the gap The Crist campaign told us they took the figure from an April 2013 release by the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington-based a think tank focusing on women’s issues. The factsheet reads, "In Florida, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $33,823 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,951 per year. This means that women in Florida are paid 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,128 between men and women who work full time in the state." Those numbers are from a larger report by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2011 American Community Survey, which estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months. It’s worth noting right now that this data has already been revised. An April 2014 release from the same think tank updated the numbers from the 2012 Census survey estimates that Floridian women are making 84 cents on the dollar. That’s not what we’d consider a huge increase, but it still is a discrepancy compared to Crist’s claim. (His campaign didn’t tell us why they used the lower number.) But the Census Bureau isn’t the only federal agency that tracks income data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures in terms of weekly wages, not yearly. Unlike the Census Bureau, this method does not account for people who are self-employed, but it does include some people not measured in the Census Bureau’s annual figures, like some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. These BLS numbers show that Florida women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $668 in 2011, which was 84 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. That edged up slightly to 85 percent in 2012. Nationally, the comparable figures from 2012 show a similar pattern: Census shows the gap at about 77 cents, while BLS says women make 82 percent of what men make. Both evaluations say Floridian men and women make less than the national median income, although the gender wage gap is marginally smaller. Why is that? There are several reasons, and none of them are flattering for Florida. Alayne Unterberger, associate research director at Florida International University’s Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy, said there’s a high level of working, single mothers in Florida, and they tend to have less education and fewer quality job opportunities. The National Women’s Law Center says almost 66 percent of Florida women make $10.10 an hour or less, and that while men only need a high school degree to move out of low-wage earning status, women usually require at least a bachelor’s degree. The slightly better wage gap is only because men in Florida are likelier to earn less than the national average at a greater rate than the state's women are, shrinking the difference. "Historically in Florida both male and female wages have been depressed," Unterberger said. She pointed out that a study FIU published in 2014 found that the wage gap has only decreased about 1.8 percent since 1990. "We haven’t done a very good job of narrowing that gap over the years." Using 2013 mean wages (not median), the FIU study adjusted for age, education level and occupation. It found that overall, women in Florida make about 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. Caveats apply to what all these evaluations actually show. Gender wage gaps nationally are different from occupation to occupation, as the Institute for Women’s Policy Research showed in its report on the top 20 occupations for women for 2011. While the gap was lesser in fields like nursing (96 cents to every dollar) and cashiering (90 cents), it was higher in accounting (77 cents) and financial advising (66 cents). While discrimination is partly to blame, another factor is that men and women historically enter different occupational fields at different rates, a trend known as "occupational segregation." The Institute showed that women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, for example, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and software engineers. That means overall, women are more often employed in lower-paying fields than are men. Women also disproportionately earn college degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. That trend, though lessened by increased male involvement in child rearing, often restricts women’s career options and hours worked. Our ruling Crist said, "Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes." The figure came from a think tank using 2011 Census annual median wage data, and was bumped up a penny to 84 cents for 2012 in its latest statement on the issue. While there are other ways to evaluate the difference between what each gender earns, with several reasons why that’s the case, the Census numbers are one widely accepted measure. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-07-30T18:03:39	2014-07-29	['None']
pomt-13540	As governor, Tim Kaine "oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-virginia-say-huge-increase-ille/	Donald Trump depicted Tim Kaine’s 2006-10 tenure as governor of Virginia as a painful time of tax hike proposals and rising unemployment. "He also oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase," Trump told supporters at an Aug. 20 rally in Fredericksburg. We wondered whether Trump was correct that, under Kaine’s governorship, illegal immigration spiked. We emailed the Trump campaign twice to ask about the basis of his statement, but we did not hear back. The GOP presidential nominee’s campaign posted a version of his speech online that includes a footnote to support his claim. It’s a 2007 editorial in The Washington Times that accused Kaine of failing to crack down on unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. But the editorial provides no insight into whether the number of illegal immigrants in the state rose during Kaine’s tenure. For additional insight, we reached out to the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, which estimates the size of the illegal immigration population in each state. Here are Pew’s figures on the size of Virginia’s illegal immigrant population by year: •2005 - 250,000 •2006 - 250,000 •2007 - 250,000 •2008 - 275,000 •2009 - 250,000 •2010 - 275,000 For 2011 and 2012, the latest years for which figures are available, the size of the illegal immigrant population also was 275,000, Pew found. So when Kaine entered office in 2006, the size of the illegal immigrant population was 250,000, it rose to 275,000 in 2008 and then went back down to its original level during 2009, his last full year in office, according to the Pew figures. If you go to 2010, during which Kaine served only the first two weeks, the illegal immigrant population was 275,000 - or 25,000 higher than when he entered the governor’s mansion. While a 10 percent increase in the illegal immigrant population between 2006 and 2010 might seem significant, it’s actually not much of a change at all from a statistical perspective, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew. Passel explained that the research group’s illegal immigration figures are not meant to be exact figures on the size of the state’s illegal immigrant population. Rather, they are estimates culled from a sample of data collected by the Census Bureau and are subject to rounding. Just like a public polls drawn from a sample, there’s a margin of error involved in the estimates. During Kaine’s time in office, the annual size of the illegal immigrant population could be 15,000 to 20,000 higher or lower than the mid-range estimate Pew reported each year, according to its report. So it’s possible that a 25,000 increase from year-to-year might not outpace the Pew study’s margin of error. The bottom line, during Kaine’s tenure the size of the illegal immigrant population remained flat, Passel said. Nationally, the illegal immigrant population peaked in 2007 at 12.2 million and fell to 11.3 million in 2013, Pew’s figures show. A major reason for that drop was the impact of the Great Recession, Passel told us. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to a question we posed about how Kaine’s policies as governor would have led to an increase in illegal immigration. Analysts told us that beyond state laws, many other factors contribute to where illegal immigrants choose to reside. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, told us illegal immigrants often settle in a state based on how its economy is doing, and whether they already have family living there. Our ruling Trump said that while Kaine was governor, he "oversaw a huge increase in illegal immigration, a tremendous increase." But figures from the Pew Hispanic Center show that the size of the illegal immigrant population essentially was flat during Kaine’s term as governor. It’s certainly not the "huge" and "tremendous" increase that Trump makes it out to be.

Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos rolled video of a voter from Latrobe, Pa.: "Senator Obama, I have a question, and I want to know if you believe in the American flag. I am not questioning your patriotism, but all our servicemen, policemen and EMS wear the flag. I want to know why you don't." Obama gave a lengthy answer first defended his patriotrism -- "I revere the American flag, and I would not be running for president if I did not revere this country" -- before repeating remarks that it's more important to act patriotically than to wear a pin. "What I've tried to do is to show my patriotism by how I treat veterans when I'm working in the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee; by making sure that I'm speaking forcefully about how we need to bring this war in Iraq to a close, because I think it is not serving our national security well and it's not serving our military families and our troops well; talking about how we need to restore a sense of economic fairness to this country because that's what this country has always been about, is providing upward mobility and ladders to opportunity for all Americans." Then he added, "I wore one yesterday when a veteran handed it to me, who himself was disabled and works on behalf of disabled veterans. I have never said that I don't wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins." This is not the first time Obama has been questioned about lapel pins. The issue first came up in October 2007 when a reporter with KCRG-TV, an ABC affiliate in Iowa, asked him, "You don't have the American flag pin on. Is that a fashion statement?" Obama said: "You know, the truth is that right after 9/11, I had a pin. Shortly after 9/11, particularly because as we're talking about the Iraq War, that became a substitute for I think true patriotism, which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security, I decided I won't wear that pin on my chest. Instead, I'm going to try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great, and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism." The comment raised enough eyebrows that Obama brought it up the next day at a campaign appearance to explain it. "I said, you know what, I probably haven't worn a flag pin in a very long time. After a while I noticed people wearing a lapel pin and not acting very patriotic. "My attitude is that I'm less concerned about what you're wearing on your lapel than what's in your heart. You show your patriotism by how you treat your fellow Americans, especially those who serve. You show your patriotism by being true to our values and ideals. That's what we have to lead with is our values and our ideals." So it is true that Obama said he won't wear the flag pin, and his statement at the debate was not accurate. Obama wasn't the only candidate, however, not wearing a flag pin. News reports from October 2007 indicate that neither Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, nor John McCain were wearing flag pins on a daily basis either. The only candidate mentioned in news reports as regularly wearing a flag pin was Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani. (For more on the flag pin controversy and reaction to the debate, see our story here.) Nevertheless, Obama did give a statement saying he didn't wear flag pins, so we find his statement, "I have never said that I don't wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins," to be False.

pomt-11678	"Death penalty opponents like Roy Cooper and Josh Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jan/03/phil-berger/top-nc-republican-accuses-democratic-governor-halt/	A North Carolina prosecutor announced recently that he’ll seek the death penalty for inmates who killed four people during an attempted prison escape. According to Republican state Sen. Phil Berger, the Senate leader, and Tim Moore, the state House speaker, the state’s top Democrats are standing in the way of the state serving justice to the prison employees who died in the October attacks. Capital punishment is on the law books in North Carolina and Berger says there are currently 143 inmates on death row. However, there hasn’t been an execution since 2006. Berger and Moore contend that’s because Gov. Roy Cooper, the former attorney general, and Josh Stein, who was elected attorney general in 2016, have failed to take legal action to counter court cases that are blocking executions. They released a joint statement on Dec. 8. Berger, specifically, was quoted as saying: "For over a decade, death penalty opponents like Roy Cooper and Josh Stein have imposed a de-facto moratorium on capital punishment in North Carolina, using every legal trick possible – including inaction – to delay death sentences handed down by juries and deny justice to victims." He continued: "No matter what they say, Cooper’s and Stein’s indifference and failure to fight the moratorium endangers the lives of prison employees in close proximity to hardened murderers with nothing left to lose, who see no possibility they will face execution for killing again." Do Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty? Are they using the legal system to block executions, as Berger and Moore imply? What’s the holdup? The last execution in North Carolina, in 2006, put to death Samuel Flippen, a 36-year-old who was convicted in the beating death of his 2-year-old stepdaughter 12 years prior to his execution. Since then, North Carolina has been one of several states that’s in a holding pattern while the courts consider legal arguments against death penalty practices. Raleigh-based television station WRAL reported last year that that North Carolina is "caught in morass of various state and federal court rulings." One legal challenge relates to the protocol for lethal injections and whether they’re cruel and unusual. While that lawsuit makes its way through the courts, Wake County Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens in 2014 blocked the use of lethal injection in the state. Stephens later retired, and the case remains unresolved. "That litigation is in the trial court and the injunction remains in place until the Court approves a new protocol and all appeals are exhausted," said Laura Brewer, a Stein spokeswoman. The other legal challenges stem from the Racial Justice Act, a short-lived law that allowed inmates to use local and statewide statistics in claims that racial bias played a role in their cases. The act was adopted in 2009, largely along party lines, and was rewritten in 2012 and then repealed in 2013 after Republicans won majorities in the General Assembly. Some of the cases are in active litigation, Brewer said. "Some have been fully briefed by the parties (including by the AG’s office for the State) and are awaiting argument at the North Carolina Supreme Court," she wrote in an email. "The Supreme Court has not set an argument date." What Cooper, Stein say Cooper served as attorney general for 16 years, from 2001 to 2016. We contacted Cooper’s office about his stance on the death penalty. Despite the fact that much of his party’s base opposes the death penalty, Cooper spokeswoman Noelle Talley pointed to his record as proof he supports it. "As Attorney General, Gov. Cooper did his duty to uphold capital punishment sentences handed down by juries in accordance with the law, and 27 executions were carried out in North Carolina during his time as AG before court orders prevented executions," Talley wrote in an email. She provided a link to the online list of the executions provided on the N.C. Department of Public Safety website. Stein was elected last year and he doesn’t have much of a record with death penalty cases, so we looked through news reports to see what he said on the campaign trail last year. Stein told WRAL in August 2016 that he backs the death penalty. "I support the death penalty because I believe that certain crimes are so heinous that it is the appropriate punishment," Stein said. But he emphasized that "the state needs to take care to avoid racial bias that has contributed to a de facto moratorium (on executions) in the state." Stein took the same position during a debate in Asheboro last September, The News & Observer reported. To conclude the first part of our fact check, Cooper has a record of enforcing the death penalty and Stein is on the record supporting it – despite the fact that it’s unpopular with many Democrats. So at this point, it would seem like a stretch to describe them as death penalty opponents. But what have they done? Berger and Moore’s statement suggests that Cooper and Stein have used their powers to further prolong the moratorium. Berger said Cooper and Stein used "every trick possible" to impose the moratorium. Brewer, Stein’s spokeswoman, said the attorney general’s office has opposed claims by Racial Justice Act defendants. "Stein and then-Attorney General Cooper have made numerous pleadings on the state’s behalf in these cases opposing the claims" regarding both the Racial Justice Act and the lethal injection case. "Neither Attorney General Stein nor then-Attorney General Cooper have filed pleadings supporting the claims," she said. And a WRAL story from 2007 quotes attorneys for Cooper, then the attorney general, arguing against attempts to block executions until the state resolved a case related to the presence of physicians at executions. Cooper and Stein didn’t file the lawsuits delaying executions or take the side of those who did. Have they used other, more subtle legal strategies for keeping the cases stuck in court? ‘Not the roadblock’ Two death penalty opponents said they’re unaware of any action Cooper has taken at any point in his career to block executions. Kristin Collins, associate director of public information at the Durham-based Center for Death Penalty Litigation, described Cooper as "very aggressive in capital prosecutions" when he was attorney general. Collins added that Cooper "certainly opposed the stay when it was requested by the inmates" in the cases that have halted executions. And with the Racial Justice Act, "the attorney general is the only one actively involved in these lawsuits and they’ve done nothing besides fight for the case of the state, which argues that these death sentences should be carried out." James Coleman, a Duke University professor and director of the Center for Criminal Justice and Professional Responsibility, said neither Cooper nor Stein is in a position now to affect the outcome of the legal challenges. "We’re not at a place where the governor or attorney general could do anything even if they wanted to resume executions," Coleman said. "They’re not the roadblock." Bob Orr, who served from 1995 to 2004 as a justice on the N.C. Supreme Court, said he’s not familiar with Stein’s position but said Cooper’s staff fought to uphold the law. "I was on the Supreme Court for 10 years. A number of executions took place. We handled a substantial number of death penalty appeals. It’s the singular most difficult part of the job," Orr said. "I never heard (Cooper) say that he’s personally opposed to the death penalty and certainly members of his staff aggressively opposed appeals (of executions)," Orr said. A ‘back-door attempt’ PolitiFact asked Berger’s office for proof that Cooper and Stein prolonged court reviews of the legal challenges. They provided none. On the day we emailed to say we’d found no evidence of Cooper or Stein supporting challenges to the court cases, Berger and Moore released a new statement once again criticizing Cooper and Stein for their inaction. Auth, Berger’s spokesperson, also followed up with an email to PolitiFact. She said Cooper and Stein could use the attorney general’s office to fight injunctions against state laws. She also argued that Stein, in 2009 as a state senator, contributed to the execution stoppage by voting for the Racial Justice Act. Supporters of the act said it was needed because statistics showed the death penalty was used disproportionately against black defendants. A Michigan State University study of capital cases in North Carolina between 1990 and 2010 shows that qualified black jurors were more than twice as likely as whites to be removed from juries by prosecutors. Many Republicans viewed the legislation as a "back-door attempt to get rid of the death penalty," as former state Sen. Thom Goolsby said at the time. Goolsby later led the repeal of the act. Former state Rep. Paul "Skip" Stam of Apex, an attorney, echoed that sentiment. "Any knowledgeable public lawyer would have realized that the RJA would be an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty for first degree murderers," Stam said in a recent email. "By 2012, it was clear as the nose on your face that the RJA was an indefinite moratorium on the death penalty and irrational to boot (all the white murderers on death row claimed racial discrimination and filed petitions to stop their executions - so far successfully)," Stam continued. "And yet, Sen. Josh Stein voted against the 2012 legislation to effectively do away with these aspects of the RJA." Our ruling In the Dec. 8 joint statement with Moore, Berger said Cooper and Stein oppose the death penalty and have used "every legal trick possible – including inaction – to delay death sentences." Berger’s office provided no evidence showing that Cooper and Stein have sided with death penalty opponents in court. Rather, Berger pointed to Stein’s vote on one bill and, in a vague claim, said the duo should’ve pressured the courts to expedite their review of death penalty cases. It’s fair to criticize how Cooper and Stein spend their resources and tie Stein to the Racial Justice Act. But those arguments alone don’t prove that they oppose the death penalty or have used legal "tricks" to delay executions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05027	"There are 60,000 fewer jobs today in this state than we had in 2008."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/13/ovide-lamontagne/granite-state-has-lost-jobs-during-recession-rest-/	In his quest for a new job in the corner office, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne is trying to keep a close eye on New Hampshire’s employment picture. "There are 60,000 fewer jobs today in this state than we had in 2008," Lamontagne, a Manchester Republican and veteran attorney, told audience members during a July 12 debate at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, N.H. "It’s going to take us until 2014, at this current rate, to re-employ who we had before," he said. Looking at the statement, we’ll leave the 2014 projection alone. As for the 60,000 jobs lost, that sounds like a job for PolitiFact. Because of his wording, we are strictly going to examine whether the number is accurate without assessing whether state officials deserve blame or credit. To start, we reached out to the Lamontagne campaign, which directed us to the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies, a non-partisan research group that released a report earlier this spring looking at the Granite State economy. The study, titled "Skills and People Matching: Where are the Jobs?" reports that New Hampshire is "missing" about 60,000 jobs. That means the current number of jobs in the state -- 626,500, according to New Hampshire employment figures -- is about 60,000 less than the jobs the state would have hosted if the recession had never settled in, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the public policy center who presented the report earlier this month. By the time the recession hit, New Hampshire had seen five consecutive years of job growth, rising from 614,900 in May 2003 to a high of 659,000 in May 2008, according to state employment figures. And, if not for the recession, the state would likely have continued to see job growth over the years to follow, reaching nearly 690,000 by now, Delay said. "All other things being equal, the economy could have gone on creating jobs," he said. "We had had a 10-year expansion prior to that point." But, then the recession intervened. Starting in spring 2008, several months after the official start of the recession, New Hampshire began to shed jobs, falling from 651,000 in May of that year to 626,500 in May 2012, the most recent figures available. Those numbers show a difference of 24,500 between May 2008 and May 2012 -- less than half of the 60,000 Lamontagne claimed. To take it a step further, the highest job total in 2008 came in February of that year with 651,600 jobs, according to the state count. That difference is 25,100 -- still less than half of Lamontagne’s figure. Those numbers, released by the New Hampshire Employment Security office, reflect the total number of full- and part-time jobs in the state, including those held by part-time workers and out-of-state residents, according to Annette Nielsen, an economist with the employment security office’s Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau. The recent numbers, seasonally adjusted, are based entirely on surveys of employers, while the older figures have been cross-checked with data collected from tax returns, Nielsen said. Neither tally includes self-employed jobs which do not contribute unemployment taxes. The employment office does not track those figures, but they shouldn’t weigh heavily on the total jobs numbers, Nielsen said. "These numbers aren’t complete, but (the 60,000) number seems a little high to me," Nielsen said. "We were closer to 30,000, and we’ve added some since then. ... That’s still a huge drop for New Hampshire." Our ruling: To Lamontagne’s point, New Hampshire, like the rest of the country, has lost many jobs since the recession started. But the candidate got his numbers wrong. The report he cites compares the current jobs count to the number the state could have reached if the recession had never hit, which isn’t the same thing. Lamontagne’s number of 60,000 jobs lost was twice as high as the actual number of jobs lost. We rate Lamontagne’s claim Half True.

pomt-05929	Says the New York Giants "train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-york-giants-are-new-jersey/	Sandwiched between two cities with avid sports fans, New Jerseyans’ favorite sport teams often don’t bear their state’s name. But as the New York Giants prepare to take on the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, Gov. Chris Christie is calling dibs: the Giants are New Jersey’s team, he said. "The only thing New York about the Giants is the ‘NY’ on their helmets. They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey," he said during a Jan. 22 interview on NBC’s "Meet the Press." The Giants defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football Conference championship game later that day, securing their spot in Super Bowl XLVI. The day after, Christie told reporters at a news conference: "It's great to have one of the state’s two football teams in the Super Bowl. As you know, I root for the Jets over the Giants, but, you know, it's great for the Giants to be there and it's good for New Jersey. And so I'm thrilled to have one of New Jersey's teams in the Super Bowl. And look forward to two weeks from yesterday. And you can be sure I will be rooting hard for the New Jersey Giants." As fans gear up for the Giants’ fifth Super Bowl appearance, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to test Christie’s three claims: the Giants "train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey." The self-declared Jets’ fan has his Giants’ facts pretty straight, we found. Since 1976, the Giants -- a team that started in New York in 1925 -- have played in a stadium in East Rutherford. In 2010, the team moved into the new MetLife Stadium, which they share with the New York Jets. The Timex Performance Center, the Giants’ practice facility, opened in 2009 in East Rutherford. The team practices there in the regular season. The team had held its summer training camp at the University at Albany since 1996. But this summer, because of a labor dispute between players and the National Football League that shortened the off-season, the Giants trained at their East Rutherford facility. It was the first time the camp was held in New Jersey since the team was at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison from 1988 to 1995. But John Mara, the Giants president and CEO, said in July that the team had "every intention" of returning this summer to Albany. So, the Giants play in New Jersey. And, at least this year, they practiced entirely in New Jersey. But where do the players live? Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon told us in an e-mail that the entire roster calls the Garden State home during football season. Of the 53 players on the active roster, PolitiFact New Jersey found 23 players who have a New Jersey address, own a home in New Jersey or have registered to vote in New Jersey, according to a public records search. Our ruling Christie claimed the New York Giants are New Jersey’s team. "They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey," he said. The Giants have called East Rutherford home since 1976 and started playing in its current stadium in 2010. For 15 years the team held its summer training camp at the University at Albany, but this year’s camp was held in New Jersey at the team’s regular-season training facility. And every player on the team’s current roster calls New Jersey home during football season, according to a Giants spokesman. We’ll leave the debate on whether that makes the Giants New Jersey’s team to gridiron fans, but we rate Christie’s statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04684	Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan attacked the president for "the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/clinton-says-ryan-attacked-obama-medicare-cuts-ref/	Bill Clinton used his nominating address at the Democratic National Convention to respond to the Republican critiques leveled at President Barack Obama during the GOP’s Tampa convention. But there was one attack in particular, he said, that "takes some brass." "When Congressman (Paul) Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama's Medicare savings as, quote, the ‘biggest coldest power play,’ I didn't know whether to laugh or cry," Clinton said in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech in Charlotte, N.C. "Because, that $716 billion is exactly, to the dollar, the same amount of Medicare savings that he had in his own budget. "You gotta give one thing, it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did." Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, is the head of the House Budget Committee and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. His idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called "premium support.") The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut "$700 billion" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Ryan’s plan cuts that amount, too! For this check, we’re looking at Clinton’s claim that Ryan attacked the president for "the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget." We recently checked a similar claim from Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter that "Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget." We’re applying what we learned to Clinton’s remark. $700 billion in Medicare cuts? There are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. Time’s passage has only boosted that number. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy, determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. Does the Ryan budget include the same savings as the health care law? Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget include those same reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes. Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Republican nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate: Stephanopoulos: "You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts." Ryan: "Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..." (Read the full exchange.) So Ryan confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings. The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks that "Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget," and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare. "Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces," said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. "A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations." Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget, as was Clinton. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the CBO. Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the same reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. He explained a few days after Cutter’s remarks that it was only because Obama’s reduction "was already in the baseline," the Wall Street Journal reported. "We would never have done it in the first place." The article points out, however, that the budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions. So it was a choice to leave the reductions in place, likely because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in. Our ruling Clinton said that Ryan attacked the president for "the same amount of Medicare savings that (Ryan) had in his own budget." Clinton is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that plan, saying Romney’s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan. Still, Clinton was right about the Ryan plan. We rate his statement True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-09-06T13:29:00	2012-09-05	['United_States', 'Paul_Ryan', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-13477	"That's legal: If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrongly-says-its-legal-fire-employ/	In June, two Kansas teens were fired from their summer job at a local pizza joint for asking why one of the two — a girl — was getting paid 25 cents less an hour than her male friend, who was doing the same job with the same level of work experience. The manager told the two employees they were being let go because discussing wages is against company policy. This is legal, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, after telling the teens’ story to an audience in Tampa, Fla. "And you know what? That's legal," she said in her Sept. 6 remarks. "If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places." Compensation transparency is a major issue among advocates for gender pay equality — including Clinton, whose platform calls on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which includes steps intended to increase compensation transparency. But Clinton’s claim is incorrect. Through a patchwork of federal and state laws, most workers in the United States enjoy some sort of protection that makes it illegal for a boss to retaliate against them for discussing pay. "If we take a snapshot today," said David Fortney, a leading employment lawyer in Washington, "I don’t think it is accurate. The majority of employees do have that protection." Primarily, there’s the National Labor Relations Act. This 80-year-old law gives most private-sector workers the right to engage in "concerted activity," which means taking action to protect or improve their employment conditions. The National Labor Relations Board specifies "employees addressing their employer about improving their pay" as an example of protected activity. The National Labor Relations Board, which administers the law, has regularly found company policies banning employees from talking about their pay to be illegal under this law. For example, the board in 2015 decided that a certain employee policy at T-Mobile was invalid because it restricted employees’ rights to discuss wage and salary information. There are significant limitations to the National Labor Relations Act, however. It doesn’t cover public-sector (government) workers, independent contractors, agricultural laborers, railway or airline workers, people in supervisor positions, or people falling into a few other small categories. Labor and employment experts told us that despite the exceptions, the law still covers most private sector workers. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have pay-transparency laws that go beyond the National Labor Relations Act. In these states, many of the groups not covered by the National Labor Relations Act, such as government employees and supervisors, have the right to discuss their pay without retaliation. As of September 2016, the states include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Vermont and the District of Columbia. Together, this group makes up about one-third of the entire U.S. population. Then there are additional federal rules covering a few other industries. While the National Labor Relations Act doesn’t cover "concerted activity" for certain interstate carriers, such as the rail and air industries, the Railway Labor Act does protect those workers. In April 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that bans any company doing contract work for the federal government from retaliating against employees for discussing their compensation. Additionally, the federal government (as well as many state and local governments) has a formal pay schedule, which means compensation information for different jobs and experience levels are in the public domain already. A worker who is concerned about pay discrimination but doesn’t fall under any of the previously discussed rules might find protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, religion or national origin. It also prohibits employers from retaliating against an employee who speaks out against discriminatory practices. While the language of the law doesn’t specifically protect employees who discuss their wages, it’s reasonable to think it would protect those employees if the discussion pertains to unfair pay discrimination, said Cynthia Estlund, a labor and employment law professor at New York University. She added that the Supreme Court has generally allowed for a broad interpretation of that aspect of Title VII. Given these rules, most workers have some sort of legal right to discuss their pay and raise the issue with their boss. But whether people know they have this right is a different story. Many workplaces have policies — written down or just generally understood — prohibiting employees from discussing pay, despite the fact that this is typically illegal. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a study out of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, in which half of all workers surveyed reported that discussing compensation is either discouraged, prohibited or could lead to punishment. People, including employees, employers and even some labor lawyers, just don’t realize that they have these rights, experts told us. One reason might be that people associate the National Labor Relations Act with union members, even though it applies to workers who aren’t part of a union, too, said William Martucci, a lawyer who represents companies in employment cases. Additionally, some people might consider the punishment for an employer who discourages pay transparency to be so weak as to be ineffective, he said. Companies generally have to give wrongfully terminated employees back pay and the option to take their job back. "It’s an area fraught with misunderstanding," Martucci said. The Paycheck Fairness Act that Clinton supports would, in part, create a universal prohibition on retaliating against an employee for discussing wages. This would bring visibility and uniformity to a legal right that many workers don’t realize they have, but as it stands, most workers already have that legal right. Wait, what happened with the Kansas pizza kids? As for the Kansas pizza restaurant, a Pizza Studio franchise, it seems that the National Labor Relations Act covered the two teens’ right to discuss pay without retaliation, as they were not supervisors. The national chain’s executive director of operations said in a statement that the manager who fired them had a "misunderstanding" of company policy. The manager has since been let go. The two teens spoke at the Democratic National Convention in July. Our ruling Clinton said, "That's legal: If you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired, in most places." Under various federal and state laws and regulations, most workers in the United States have the legal right to discuss compensation and raise pay discrimination concerns with their employers. Consequently, employers generally can’t retaliate against an employee for engaging in those discussions. However, the laws are a patchwork, meaning that some small percentage of people could fall through the cracks. And the fact that many people and companies don’t realize what the law says weakens their effect. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/baca2dbb-8e84-4a0d-9773-7c3c19980cdb	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-09T16:52:14	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-02936	"FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/30/valerie-jarrett/valerie-jarrett-says-nothing-obamacare-forces-peop/	The White House has been on the defensive recently over its claim, repeated numerous times over the years, that under President Barack Obama’s health care law, if you like your health plan, you can keep it. His claim hasn’t worn well amid the letters to hundreds of thousands of Americans with individually purchased insurance plans notifying them that their plans are being canceled. Typically, these policies no longer meet the requirements in Obama’s law, such as the need to cover emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. In August 2012, we gave a Half True to Obama’s claim that "if you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance." A more careful phrasing -- former Obama adviser David Axelrod’s claim that "the vast majority of people in this country are keeping their (health insurance) plan" -- recently earned a Mostly True rating. But critics of the law have been on the attack about what they call Obama’s broken promise. Defending the law, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett sent out this message via Twitter on Oct. 28, 2013: "FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans. No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans." Is it really a "fact" that "nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans"? The White House appears to think so. Asked about Jarrett’s tweet at a White House press briefing the following day, Press Secretary Jay Carney backed up her view that it’s the insurers’ fault -- not the administration’s -- if plans are being canceled. It’s insurers who are choosing to close plans, Carney said, noting that "the administration doesn’t step in" to force cancellations. Instead, he said, "the insurer is making a decision to basically cancel the plan and reissue or offer the individual a new plan with different benefits or different costs." While it’s technically true that the insurer makes the final decision, their choices are, to a great degree, limited by the law and the way it’s been implemented by the administration. Much of this process has to do with the arcane process of "grandfathering" plans that existed prior to the law’s enactment in March 2010. Under the law, insurance plans -- either those purchased through an employer or on the individual market -- may be "grandfathered" if they have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements, such as mandatory coverage for emergency and maternity care. But experts say the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are pretty tight. As our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out, one of the regulations says that grandfathered status must end if copayments increase by more than $5.00 plus the cost of medical inflation. And once a plan is poised to lose its grandfathered status, it’s on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail these days, and that is attracting so much attention. Health policy experts told us that, in a technical sense, insurers are pulling the plug on these old, grandfathered policies. Echoing what Jarrett tweeted, Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor, said that "if a grandfathered plan is being terminated, it is the insurer’s decision -- nothing in the law requires it." But other experts said that while this is technically true, it gives a distorted view of what’s going on. The law places grandfathered plans in such a straitjacket -- unable to attract new individual policyholders and unable to adjust terms to market conditions -- that it’s only a matter of time before companies are driven to pull the plug. To ignore the government’s role in establishing the parameters for this highly regulated, and highly competitive, industry is substantially misleading. Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, called Jarrett’s message "word games." "Insurance companies cannot continue to sell individual policies that don’t meet the requirements of the essential benefit package, either to individuals or to small businesses, as of Jan. 1," Wilensky said. "But since the insurance companies are not allowed to continue to sell these plans that the person previously had bought and may have liked, they are effectively being forced to change their plan." Austin Frakt, a health care economist at Boston University who generally supports Obamacare, agreed that "Jarrett's statement misses an important point." By all accounts, even the employers who are offering grandfathered plans to their employees are dwindling over time. The annual study of health insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that the percentage of workers enrolled in grandfathered plans has decreased from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Another study, by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, found that of the one-quarter of organizations that still have a grandfathered plan, less than half expect to keep their grandfathered status beyond the next two years. In other words, the grandfathered plan is slowly but steadily becoming a dinosaur. Beyond the question of grandfathering, Frakt sees another element of the law that could strongly encourage -- though again perhaps falling short of requiring -- changes in health insurance plans. A 40 percent excise tax on high-benefit plans is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2018. While that’s several years away, the provision "will change plans, either by making them more costly or incentivizing redesigns to get below the premium cap," Frakt said. The irony here, both Wilensky and Frakt said, is that there are ways to describe what’s going on that are both more broadly accurate and more flattering to the policy changes being undertaken. The administration’s "better argument is that we are making sure people have ‘real’ insurance that will be guaranteed to cover them when they need it," Wilensky said. Frakt concurred. "The right view of this is that the law does motivate or force change, and that's a virtue," he said. Our ruling Jarrett said it was a "fact" that "nothing in Obamacare forces people out of their health plans." Saying there’s "nothing" in the law that forces people out of their health plans is a pretty extreme claim -- one that implies that insurers who pull the plug on non-Obamacare-compliant plans are acting in some sort of government-free vacuum. Even if it’s technically true that the insurer pulls the plug on a plan, the insurer will only be doing this because the law itself and its implementing regulations have created a context in which, sooner or later, old-fashioned plans will inevitably pass into oblivion -- as the law always intended. We rate the statement False.	None	Valerie Jarrett	None	None	None	2013-10-30T16:16:45	2013-10-28	['None']
pomt-01987	In the 1950s and 1960s, "the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/15/jack-reed/jack-reed-says-minimum-wage-1950s-and-1960s-would-/	In the battle to raise the federal minimum wage, proponents have been arguing that the minimum wage now buys far less than it has in the past, and is no longer high enough to lift someone out of poverty. During a May 1 speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Jack Reed (D-RI) offered a version of that argument. "The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 2009 and today an individual who works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks a year, at the federal minimum wage earns $15,080 per year, and that is nearly $5,000 below the federal poverty level for a family of three, and almost $9,000 below the poverty level for a family of four," he said. "People who work hard for a living shouldn't have to live in poverty, and that was not the case in the ‘50s and the ‘60s when the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty," Reed said. "And I think that's what we have to do today." Reed supports a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, which would bring a family of three above the poverty threshold. For this fact check, we are going to examine whether the minimum wage was really high enough in the 1950s and 1960s to pull people out of poverty. We asked Reed's spokesman for the source of his statistic. While we waited for a response, we looked on our own. For historical minimum wage data, we went to the U.S. Department of Labor. During the time period Reed was talking about, the minimum rose six times, starting at 40 cents per hour and eventually reaching $1.60. How much did it take to lift someone out of poverty during that era? That's a much harder question to answer, and it depends on the size of the family, something Reed wasn't specific about. The federal poverty level, the adequacy of which is still the subject of debate, wasn't developed until the early 1960s, so it wasn't even in existence during the start of the time period Reed was talking about. The first "poverty threshold," in 1963, was about $3,100 for a family of four. Someone earning the minimum wage that year would have earned $2,460, enough for a family of three but not a family of four, according to the "Social Welfare and the Economy" page on the Social Security Administration's Office of Retirement and Disability Policy website. Those data only go back to 1959. We used a cost of living calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to get a rough idea of living costs from 1950 through 1958. According to our calculations, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the minimum wage was high enough to keep an individual above the poverty level The first time it was enough to push a two-person family above the poverty level was in 1956, when it jumped to $1 an hour. But throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in most years, the minimum wage couldn’t lift a family of three out of poverty and was never enough for a family of four. When we shared our information with Reed's office, they provided information that confirmed our findings. Reed spokesman Chip Unruh said the senator’s statement about the minimum wage and poverty levels in the ‘50s and ‘60s is accurate. "I think it is very clear that Reed is talking about his perception that hard work used to get you a livable wage," he said. "The federal poverty rate as measured today didn't always exist as a unit of measurement, but that doesn't mean poverty itself didn't exist . . . Reed referenced families earlier in his speech, but he also was referencing individuals." Our ruling Sen. Jack Reed, lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage, said that in the 1950s and 1960s, "the minimum wage was such that it would lift you out of poverty." We found that during that period, the minimum wage always generated enough income to keep an individual out of poverty. But when it comes to making enough money to support a family -- and Reed made several references to families -- that wasn't always true during those two decades. Based on federal data, the minimum wage didn't become high enough to support a two-person family until about 1956 and it wasn't consistently high enough to lift a family of three until 1967. It never covered a family of four, regarded as a typical family size in that era. One might assume that Reed was talking about families, but the statement we're checking isn't specific. Because that statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13503	"Undocumented workers crossing the border right now is at a 12-year low."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-unauthorized-immigrant-border-cr/	Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson scoffs at Donald Trump’s call for the U.S. should build a wall on the southwest border to keep immigrants out. "Undocumented workers crossing the border right now is at a 12-year low," Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said in an Aug. 29 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch editorial board. We wondered if Johnson’s claim about a dramatic decrease in border crossings is correct. Joe Hunter, the Libertarian nominee’s director of communications, pointed us to a December 2014 report written by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan group that takes no position on immigration policy. Mexican border detentions Pew’s report says 229,000 Mexicans were apprehended at U.S. borders in 2014. That, Pew said, was a steep drop from 2007, the year the Great Recession began, when 809,000 Mexicans were detained at the border. A graphic in the Pew study shows the 2014 Mexican immigrant border detentions was the lowest it’s been, not just during the past 12 years but for any year in the early 2000s, the 1990s and 1980s. Also in 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended 257,000 non-Mexicans, making it the first year on record that detentions of non-Mexicans outpaced those of Mexicans trying to cross into the U.S., the Pew report said. "This shift is another sign that unauthorized immigrants from Mexico are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border significantly less often than they did before the Great Recession," Pew’s study says. The trend of fewer Mexican border detentions continued in 2015, the latest full fiscal year. In that year, the agency apprehended 188,122 Mexicans trying to cross illegally, Border Patrol figures show. That’s the lowest level during the past 12 years. You may have noticed that all of these figures focus on "apprehensions." It would not take into account illegal workers who come across the border without drawing notice from authorities. Immigration analysts have told PolitiFact numerous times that there is no perfect comprehensive measure of people entering the U.S. illegally. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas put it: "There’s no direct indicator of illegal immigration. Folks don’t report in." In the absence of definitive data, experts use the apprehension figures to get an idea of border-crossing trends. The U.S. Border and Customs Enforcement says its apprehension figures are "an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally." The figures Johnson’s campaign cites focus on apprehensions around the entire U.S. border, including the border with Canada. The vast majority - some 98 percent - of Border Patrol apprehensions occur along the southwestern border, according to agency figures. Also, his campaign’s response further zeroes in on apprehensions of Mexicans caught while trying to cross the border. But Johnson, during the editorial board interview, referenced not just Mexicans but all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. That suggests that the border crossings for all illegal immigrants is at a 12-year low. Border crossings by all immigrants Looking at all detentions around the entire U.S. border, the Border Patrol says it apprehended 337,117 people trying to get into the U.S. in fiscal 2015, which ended last Sept. 30. That was the lowest level in decades. But if you look at the southwestern border, Johnson’s statement hits a snag. In 2011, Border Patrol agents reported apprehending 327,577 border-crossers there, a bit lower than 2015. PolitiFact National on July 26 rated Mostly True a statement by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who said that southwest border crossings have been at the lowest level in 30 years. PolitiFact noted that the 2011 figure creates a wrinkle for such a broad claim. Still, some researchers told PolitiFact that they gave Gutierrez the benefit of the doubt. "Given the uncertain ratio between apprehensions and actual crossings, it would be fair to call 2015 and 2011 a statistical ‘tie,’" Jacob L. Vigdor, a professor at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington, told PolitiFact. These figures only go through fiscal 2015, which ended in September that year. We’re still in the midst of fiscal 2016, and updated information about the fiscal year has been released in the weeks since that fact-check was published. It shows the number of apprehensions at the southwest border has surpassed the total for all of fiscal 2015. The Border Patrol keeps a running month-to-month tally of apprehensions along the southwest border. Through July of this fiscal year, 332,360 people have been apprehended along the border. That’s just a tad higher than last fiscal year, but there’s still a couple months of the 2016 apprehension figures to go. In recent years, about 50,000 to 60,000 apprehensions occur in the last couple months of the fiscal year, meaning this year is on pace to end at around 400,000 apprehensions at the southern border. That still would be lower than eight of the past 12 years. But that 400,000 level would be higher than in fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2015. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates tighter immigration controls, told PolitiFact in July that there really is no way to know for sure if the number of people illegally crossing the border is less than in recent decades. Camarota also said apprehensions are a weak way to measure new illegal immigration, because it doesn’t count visa overstays. Experts estimate that one-third to one-half of illegal immigrants aren’t people who crossed the border but instead came into the U.S. on visas and overstayed. Our ruling Johnson said, "Undocumented workers crossing the border right now is at a 12-year low." There is no comprehensive set of figures that can definitively say how many people come across the border illegally, when taking into account both people who get caught and people who evade authorities. Still, experts and Border Patrol officials do look at figures on border apprehensions to get an idea of the level of crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson points to a drop in illegal border crossings from Mexican immigrants to justify his statement, and it’s true that in fiscal 2015, the latest full fiscal year, the number of Mexican immigrants apprehended at the southern border was the lowest during the past 12 years. But Johnson’s statement suggests that we’re seeing a historic low in all illegal immigrants coming across the southern border. His statement requires some clarification in that there are a couple years when there were lower levels of apprehensions. Still the former New Mexico governor has a point that the level of apprehensions currently is at a relative low point compared with the past dozen years. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-03244	"Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in (St. Petersburg) are caused by people leaving their keys in the car."	true	/florida/statements/2013/aug/14/bill-foster/60-percent-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-keys-left-/	St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster interrupted last week's mayoral forum with an important public service announcement: Don't leave your keys in the car. No, really. The plea came in the middle of a discussion on crime, with Foster noting that good police work can't overcome people's lack of common sense. "Sixty percent of the auto thefts that we have in the city are caused by people leaving their keys in the car," Foster said. The problem is so bad, city officials say, that the Police Department created a sassily named mascot Willie Everlern to help spread the message to residents. In a black-and-white video, Everlern is shocked to discover that his car was heisted after he left the keys inside while he walked into a convenience store. We wondered if the situation in St. Petersburg can actually be this bad. Lo and behold, it’s worse. Out of the 551 cars stolen so far this year, 460 of them had keys either in the ignition or elsewhere in the vehicle, Police Chief Chuck Harmon said. That’s 83.4 percent. "If I were a car thief, I’d move to St. Petersburg," said Frank Scafidi, spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, when told of the numbers. Scafidi said the percentage might be a "high-water mark" in the country. Over the past several years, car technology has made vehicles harder to steal with screwdrivers and other tools. Many new cars have transponder keys, which means someone can’t unlock or start the car unless the key fob is close to the vehicle. As a result, St. Petersburg has seen a 70 percent drop in auto thefts over the past decade, Harmon said. As a result, people leaving their keys in their cars has become an increasing source of car thefts in the city. The thefts are crimes of opportunity, so 96 percent of cars are recovered later where the thief ran out of gas. Most area offenders are not trying to bring cars to chop shops or resell high-end models. People are just capitalizing on careless driver mistakes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 40 to 50 percent of auto thefts nationwide are due to keys in the car. Just lock your cars, people. As Harmon said, "It’s not rocket science." One other note: It’s technically illegal to leave your car unattended and running. So not only do you run the risk of having your car stolen, the police could issue you a ticket. Our ruling Foster said that 60 percent of car thefts occur because the owner left keys inside the vehicle. In St. Petersburg this year, it’s actually 83.4 percent. An expert said that might be tops in the country. The specific number aside, Foster’s point that many auto thefts can easily be avoided is 100 percent on the mark. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04175	President Barack Obama’s Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal "couldn't get support from either party in the House or the Senate."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/dec/16/kelly-ayotte/obamas-budget-was-flop-both-parties-says-kelly-ayo/	Presented last month, President Barack Obama’s initial deficit reduction proposal sounded familiar to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. Targeting the same tax increases without any significant entitlement reforms, the proposal had the same tenets as Obama’s last budget, according to Ayotte, New Hampshire’s junior senator. And, unless the president comes up with something new, it’s likely to meet a similar death, she said in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. "I see (the proposal) as very disappointing," Ayotte told anchor Candy Crowley during the December 2 interview. "(We have) a big problem in this country. That's why I didn't like seeing what was essentially a re-run of his budget that couldn't get support from either party in the House or the Senate. … It is time for us to come together and solve the big problems." Obama’s Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, introduced in February 2012 never reached the House floor for a vote. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it failed to get support from either side. We decided to take a closer look. We must note that the president’s budget proposal does not dictate federal spending. Rather, the proposal serves as a starting point for House and Senate lawmakers as they shape their own spending plans. Such was the case for the president’s $3.2 trillion proposal that the White House first unveiled onFeb. 13, 2012. Despite Ayotte’s claim that the budget received no support from either party in the House or Senate, Obama’s budget drew immediate praise from some leading Democrats. "The President has put forth a budget that invests in job creation and economic growth in the short-term and gets our nation on a long-term, responsible path to fiscal sustainability," U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said at the time in a written statement. "President Obama’s budget would continue to move the nation in the right direction," U.S. Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, added in a statement. "For the near-term, it correctly focuses on strengthening the economy and creating jobs. That is the right near-term priority." The next month, the House Budget Committee, led by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the future vice presidential nominee, countered with its own proposal, titled The Path to Prosperity. Before House lawmakers acted on the Ryan budget, however, Republicans called for a vote on the President’s spending plan in the form of House Amendment 999, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican. The amendment, based on spending and revenue numbers from the president’s budget, fell in the House 244-0, and, two months later, a similar motion, Concurrent Resolution 41, failed the Senate by a 99-0 count. Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff referenced these two votes as support for her statement. Republicans, both at the time and now, argue that the amendments mirrored the president’s spending plans and the votes represented an indictment of the president and his spending plan. "It is the President's budget. It has the numbers in it that the President had. They directly reflect the President's request," U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, the primary sponsor of the amendment, said as he presented the amendment on the Senate floor. But, then as in now, Democratic opponents, analysts and news outlets called the amendments maneuvers and stunts intended to stir up opposition to the president and his budget. At the time, the White House called the House amendment a "gimmick," saying it intended to distract lawmakers from the damaging effects of the House Republicans’ budget, according to an article printed in The Hill. And now, nine months later, political analysts continue to see the amendments as political stunts more than a meaningful action. In both cases, the amendments were sponsored by Republican lawmakers who never intended them to pass, including only the final budget figures without any specific department breakdowns or tax policies, according to Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. "It’s pure political maneuvering. Fairly simply," Williams said. "The Republicans were the ones who brought it up. You know they didn't want to pass it. They do it for pure political reasons." Further, without the political motives, Congress, the nation’s budgeting authority, would not adopt the president’s budget in fear of losing its autonomy, according to Stuart Kasdin, an assistant professor of public policy and public administration at George Washington University. "That would be something like saying we're no longer able to govern ourselves, we just take what the president gives us," Kasdin said. "Even if this weren't a politically charged environment, Congress would never start like that." After the amendment vote, the House went on to approve the House Republican budget proposal, which then stalled in the Democratic-led Senate. But, with the failed amendments, Republican lawmakers came away with a good talking point regarding the president’s budget proposal heading into the fall election, analysts said. "It’s happened in past years … and it’s never viewed as serious," said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. " "It’s what we generally describe as votes that are designed to make some sort of a point, and then the other party always tries to avoid giving it any credibility by going along and having everybody vote it down," he said. "But it certainly doesn't mean that the people who voted against it don’t support the president’s budget." Our ruling: Looking only at the votes taken on the House and Senate amendments, there’s a kernel of truth to Ayotte’s statement. Neither amendment earned a single vote from either party. However, these amendments represented only a skeleton of the president’s budget, and the sponsors offered them to score political points, not for serious consideration. Further, Ayotte said Obama’s budget couldn’t get "support" -- she never used the word "votes." And the truth is Democrats in both the House and Senate showed plenty of support for Obama’s $3.2 trillion budget plan by praising it when it was released. We rate Ayotte’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-03437	A monthly "police and fire protection fee" on all Wisconsin phone bills does nothing to support police and fire.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/24/andre-jacque/billed-being-police-and-fire-wisconsin-phone-fee-d/	If PolitiFact Wisconsin had a Truth-O-Meter rating called False But Revealing, we might give it to state Rep. Andre Jacque for a claim about what he described as the state’s "radically misnamed" police and fire protection fee. The DePere Republican went too far in decrying the 75-cent fee, which appears on Wisconsin phone bills every month and brings in some $50 million per year. Speaking with the conservative MacIver Institute on May 15, 2013, he said: "What does it do to support police and fire? Nothin.’" But even though Jacque exaggerates the situation, his claim is revealing for anyone with a landline or wireless phone who pays what, in fact, is the misleadingly labeled "police and fire protection fee." The fee -- and a bill The fee was created in the 2009-11 state budget, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was in office and Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature. Phone service providers don’t have to itemize the fee on their bills. But if they do, they must -- by law -- identify it as a "police and fire protection fee." Back in 2009, the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee, which retools the governor’s budget request before it goes to the full Legislature, initially proposed the fee to fund 911 system enhancements around the state. But later in the budget process, faced with projections of declining revenues, the committee redirected the phone fee funds. Rather than being dedicated to 911, the money would instead go toward "shared revenue" payments the state makes to counties, towns, villages and cities. Shared revenue is general, unrestricted aid to local governments. Typically, it is "commingled with the local government's other revenues and is not directly tied to any specific function," the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau notes. In other words, shared revenue -- which ranks among the largest general fund state appropriations -- can be used toward a wide variety of local government operations, like parks, planning, roads, snow plowing, garbage collection, not just police and fire. Redirecting the money was supposed to last only two years. But Doyle vetoed that provision, which meant the money would continue to be used toward shared revenue payments. Republican Gov. Scott Walker kept the same arrangement in his 2011-13 budget and is not proposing to change it in his 2013-15 budget. Upset with the whole thing, Jacque has introduced a bill to eliminate the fee, which is projected to bring in $53 million per year during the 2013-15 budget cycle. Jacque’s argument Jacque defended his statement to us by saying that because phone fee revenue goes to the state’s general fund, it does nothing to support police and fire protection. But that overstates what is happening. While the roughly $50 million per year in phone fee money might technically go to the state’s general fund, it is earmarked for shared revenue and thus ends up with local governments. So, indirectly, the phone fee helps support police and fire, given that a county sheriff’s department, or a city police or fire department, are among the largest expenses in local government. Our rating Jacque said a 75 cents-per-month "police and fire protection fee" on Wisconsin phone bills does nothing to support police and fire. The $50 million per year in phone fee revenue isn’t dedicated to police and fire protection. But the money does support those services indirectly, in that it goes to local governments, which spend a large portion of their budgets on police and fire services. We give a nod to Jacque for highlighting the misleading nature of the police and fire phone fee, but we rate his claim False.

pomt-05872	Says Gov. Bob McDonnell's budget would cut pre-kindergarten programs.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/09/george-barker/sen-george-barker-says-mcdonnells-budget-cuts-pre-/	Democrats say Gov. Bob McDonnell wants to slash a state program that helps disadvantaged 4-year olds prepare for kindergarten. "Particularly short-sighted are cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs that put disadvantaged children on a path to success," said Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, in his party’s response to McDonnell’s state of the commonwealth address on Jan. 11. Barker was referring to proposed changes to the Virginia Preschool Initiative, which teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line and therefore do not qualify for the federal Head Start program. Is Barker correct in saying the governor has proposed cutting money from the pre-school program? We took a look. First, we turned to the budget numbers. The state allocated $65.1 million for the pre-K initiative this school year, although the money may be reduced slightly because of lower-than-anticipated enrollment. McDonnell’s 2013 budget proposes $68.2 million or the program, followed by $68.5 million in 2014. So in terms of raw dollars, Barker’s claim doesn’t hold up. But Barker said we needed to dig deeper. He offered two pieces of evidence to support his claim: 1) McDonnell’s budget would fund the initiative far below the levels urged by the state Board of Education, and 2) The governor has proposed a new method to estimate the number of children eligible for the program that would cut slots in the future. The Board of Education recommended the state spend $215.7 million for the pre-K initiative during the two-year-budget cycle that starts July 1. The board assumed that every eligible child would enroll. But the program is voluntary: divisions can opt in or out and children can show up or not. In recent years, about 70 percent of eligible children have participated. The legislature has funded the programs on anticipated 75 percent participation. Under McDonnell’s proposal, which assumes partial participation, Virginia would spend about $80 million less for pre-K than the Board of Education urged over the biennium. But the board does not appropriate money, it only makes recommendations to the General Assembly. So it’s a stretch for Barker to say McDonnell cut the program based on the governor’s rejection of a funding recommendation that was far above the legislature’s existing appropriation. McDonnell, we note again, is asking the legislature to slightly increase spending on the initiative over the next two years. Now, let’s look at Barker’s second assertion: that McDonnell has proposed a new way of estimating enrollment that would shortchange the pre-kindergarten program. The state has traditionally relied on a computation of the Virginia Employment Commission’s population estimate of 4-year-olds in each locality factored with economic demographics. McDonnell wants to base the estimate solely on the number of kindergartners in each public school division that qualify for free and reduced-cost lunch programs at schools. Barker and other Democrats say McDonnell’s method would result in low estimates of at-risk 4-year-olds, because using a public school kindergarten count excludes children who attend private school or are home schooled. For the school year starting this fall, the traditional formula would lead to an estimated 28,777 Virginia children eligible for the pre-K initiative. That number includes an estimated 4,334 additional children who will qualify for the service because of new federal standards that expand eligibility for free and reduced school lunches. McDonnell’s proposed budget assumes 24,483 children will eligible for the pre-K-program next school year. He is proposing funding for 18,256 children in 2013 and 18,391 in 2014. That would allow for increases from this year’s statewide enrollment of 16,618. But there’s a catch. Under McDonnell’s formula, 27 localities would lose state money for 1,135 pre-K slots that are now occupied, according to analysis by the Department of Education. The governor has proposed a short-term solution that essentially protects the municipalities from a loss in pre-K funding over the next two school years. Barker points out that once the guarantee expires in 2015, the 27 localities would lose state funding for those slots. Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications, said McDonnell will consider that issue in two years when he submits a new biennial budget to the legislature. Our ruling: Barker, speaking for fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, said the governor’s budget makes "cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs." Bottom-line budget numbers do not support the senator’s claim. McDonnell’s budget would provide more than a $3 million annual increase to pre-K spending. The governor’s spending plan also contains a new method for the state to estimate the number of four-year-olds who would participate in the pre-K program. McDonnell has ensured that the number of slots available to at-risk preschoolers would increase during the next two budget years. But starting in 2015, as Barker notes, the policy would result in about one-fifth of localities losing state funding for some of the children they serve. Barker’s statement contains an element of truth in that some cities and counties eventually could suffer under McDonnell’s pre-K proposal. But it ignores the larger fact that the program would expand in most of the state. We rate Barker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-13750	In South Sudan, "more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/25/unicef/unicef-more-girls-south-sudan-die-childbirth-gradu/	There are countries where the measures of well-being tell such a bleak story, you have to stop and verify them. South Sudan falls in that group. UNICEF, the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, marked the fifth year since this African nation separated from its northern neighbor with a photo essay about five children. One showed a little girl shyly smiling as she holds an oversized slate chalkboard bearing two perfectly legible number 5s. The caption read, "Only about 10 percent of girls in South Sudan complete primary school, and the typical age of marriage in rural areas is rarely over 15. As a result, more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school." South Sudan emerged as an independent country in 2011 after years of civil war. Its people barely had time to catch their collective breath before friction between two rival factions turned the country back into a battlefield again. The fighting has forced millions from their homes. Under these conditions, it’s plausible that more teenage girls dying in childbirth than graduate from high school, but every claim needs data behind it, and we went looking. Girls in South Sudan who finish high school Ongoing conflict has made education nearly impossible. A 2014 Brookings Institution article noted that "approximately 50 percent of primary school-age children are currently not in school." So how many girls finish high school? We can’t say for certain, but we know the number is quite low. The South Sudanese government reported that in 2013, just 730 girls were in the last year of secondary school out of a total population over 12 million. Girls in South Sudan who die in childbirth Finding a precise number of teenage girls in South Sudan who die during childbirth is more complicated because accurate data in a war zone is hard to come by. To get even a crude estimate, we had to rely on a couple of figures. First a 2008 survey of South Sudan found that about 10.3 percent of all women in the country were 15-19. That translates to about 610,000 teenage girls. A 2010 government health survey said that "in South Sudan, one-third of the 15-19 year old women start childbearing." That would mean about 207,000 young women are at risk of dying in childbirth. Based on UNICEF data, the nonprofit aid group International Medical Corps wrote that "with 2,054 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, South Sudan has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world." When we apply that rate to the number of young women at risk, we get over 4,000 deaths. That’s nearly six times the maximum number of female high school graduates. What experts say People and groups with on-the-ground experience in South Sudan said they have no reason to doubt UNICEF’s comparison. Lydia Stone, now with the British aid organization Social Development Direct, told us that "while there is a dearth of reliable, recent data in South Sudan, this UNICEF claim is almost certainly true." Stone said that most girls "are married around the age of 15-16 some even younger. Their bodies are not ready to bear children and - outside of aid agencies - the health system is virtually non-existent." Canada is a major donor of relief services in South Sudan. Global Affairs Department spokeswoman Jessica Seguin said "South Sudanese girls’ face significant inequalities in terms of access to education, and are at a high risk of early and forced child marriage, and accompanying obstetric health problems." In a 2012 field report, Stone wrote that the society puts a premium on women having as many children as possible. During the first civil war, government leaders cast pregnancy as a patriotic duty. But Stone wrote that in interviews, many women embraced their role quite apart from any overt pressure. "One woman said, ‘There is no limit; if I can have 15 or 20, then I will. It is for God to decide.’" Our ruling UNICEF wrote that in South Sudan, "more teenage girls die in childbirth than finish high school." The claim is almost certainly correct, experts say. But there is no single data source that can verify the comparison. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	UN's UNICEF	None	None	None	2016-07-25T11:21:39	2016-07-06	['None']
pomt-13199	"Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/oct/24/dccc-lgo/bizarre-campaign-ad-wrongly-ties-trump-and-david-j/	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a bizarre ad in October warning that a vote for Congressman David Jolly in the 13th Congressional District is a vote for Donald Trump's right-hand man. The ad ties Jolly and Trump together through photoshopped images and shared views on opposing abortion rights and defunding Planned Parenthood. "Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose," says the narrator in the ad. This remark stood out to us, so we wanted to take a look at each man’s view on abortions. Moreover, the goal of the ad and its methods have been widely criticized, so we’ll examine the relationship between Trump and Jolly. The evidence linking Trump and Jolly’s stances on abortion is hard to pinpoint, given the fact both have talked about abortion in different ways. What’s not hard to pinpoint is the relationship between Trump and Jolly, which just doesn’t exist. Jolly has never met Trump, nor is he supporting him for president. Trump and Jolly on abortion Trump and Jolly are are on the same side of the abortion spectrum, but their views are hard to lump together as one and the same. Jolly’s campaign told PolitiFact Florida he calls himself pro-life, but has never supported or voted to outlaw abortion entirely. At the congressional debate on Sept. 19, Jolly was asked if it's right for a woman to abort her baby if she finds out she has Zika in the early stages of pregnancy. Jolly responded: "I think that is her choice, but for the health of the mother or the health of the baby, or the life of the mother, I think there should be exceptions permitted to terminate the pregnancy. Yes, I do." There are other exceptions Jolly embraces, too, including instances of rape or incest. Jolly may say he doesn’t support outlawing abortion, but what does his voting record say? The DCCC points to the "Life at Conception Act" (H.R. 1091) that Jolly co-sponsored in 2014. This act would give a fetus the same rights as a human beings from the moment of fertilization. This is clearly an anti-abortion rights bill, but as PolitiFact concluded in 2014, there’s a lot of murkiness that courts would have to sort through before it would be clear if abortion would be outlawed. Whether or not Trump wants to outlaw abortion is hard to determine. In March, Trump stated women should be punished for having an abortion. (You can read the whole remark in context here.) But he backed off saying women should specifically be punished to stating general opposition to abortion. "If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman," the Trump statement says. "The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions." Recently at the third presidential debate, Trump was asked if he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which would essentially dissolve a woman’s right to abortions. Trump said: "Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states." Jolly does not support Trump This ad has been highly criticized for its bogus images showing Trump and Jolly photoshopped together. Like the claim, the ad attempts to paint Trump and Jolly as one in the same — and allies if both Jolly and Trump win. This association is not accurate. At the congressional debate, Jolly said he doesn’t support Trump and told the Tampa Bay Times he never met him. Jolly’s spokesperson reiterated that point to PolitiFact Florida on Oct. 20 and said Jolly will not be supporting Trump in this election. Jolly called on Trump to drop out of the presidential race in December after Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims. At the time of the press release, Jolly was running for Marco Rubio’s seat in the U.S. Senate. "While ISIS is beheading innocent people for their religious practices, Trump is betraying our freedoms," Jolly said in a statement. "His brutal, bullying bigotry runs contrary to the very principles our forefathers fought so hard to defend. We are either a party of protecting the constitution and religious liberties or we're not. America should insist on a security test but never a religious test." Our ruling An ad from the DCCC said, "Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose." Trump and Jolly both favor restrictions on abortion, but their views cannot be directly equated to outlawing all instances of abortion. Moreover, the claim, and the overall theme of the ad — that Jolly would be an ally to Trump — is highly misleading. Jolly does not support Trump. We rate the DCCC’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-13952	The average student debt "coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/17/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-average-uw-madison-student-grad/	During the first day of the Wisconsin Democratic Convention, Russ Feingold told delegates about what he experienced during his trip across Wisconsin -- an effort marked by campaign stops in all 72 counties in his bid to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. After saying Wisconsinites talked about hot topics such as income inequality, paid family leave and Social Security, Feingold turned his attention to Johnson and college students. "Finally, I didn’t hear a single student in this state agree with Sen. Johnson’s comment that students like to take out student loans because they think it’s free money," said Feingold, a Democrat who lost to Johnson in 2010. "Students don’t like that. It’s actually scary. "The average debt coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like $28,000." With in-state tuition ringing up at just over $5,000 a semester, we wondered if Feingold was right. Behind the numbers We checked a similar claim about student debt from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2014. She claimed that "this generation, on average, is starting their careers, if they’ve been to a four-year college, with just under $30,000 in debt." We rated her claim Half True, as she didn’t mention the data’s limitations and some cases suggest the level may be lower. For backup to Feingold’s, his team sent us links to a few news articles that cited the average debt incurred by students at UW-Madison. We reached out to the officials to confirm the numbers, which come from UW’s Office of Student Financial Aid. The most recent year for which statistics are available is 2014-15 and the average debt for students at the time of graduation that year was $28,769. That’s slightly higher than the figure Feingold used. Loans taken out by students through the university are tracked by the office through its Student Information System. Loans not borrowed at UW-Madison are fed into the system through the National Student Loan Data System, a student aid database from the U.S. Department of Education. Loans taken out by parents on behalf of students are not included. But the number is a little over reaching. When UW’s Office of Student Financial Aid calculates the average debt of students, it only counts those who take out loans. So, how many students are included? According to the office, just about half of students at UW-Madison graduate with debt -- 3,374 of the 6,798 students who graduated in 2015. If we spread out the loans among all students, average debt would hover around $14,000. We think the best way to measure the amount of debt incurred is to examine only students who take out loans. And that tracks more closely with what Feingold said. Another qualifier: The numbers doesn’t take into account other ways students could be in debt -- credit cards, car loans, for instance. But that is impossible to track. Meanwhile, in the entire UW System, 73.5 percent of students borrow money, with the average debt at graduation for those students reaching $30,651. Our rating Feingold said the average student debt "coming out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is something like 28,000 dollars." His number was on target, but he failed to mention the average only included about half of all students -- those who borrowed money for their educational expenses. The other half left with no debt at all. Feingold’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. That’s our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-13539	Says Hillary Clinton "voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/29/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-facebook-post-misses-mark/	Hillary Clinton has made it clear on multiple occasions she doesn’t want to raise taxes on the middle class, but the Republican Party of Florida said she once voted to do just that. The party posted an image on its Facebook page that says Clinton "voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500." Is Clinton guilty of double speak? What we found is the truth was far more nuanced than the what the image claims. Clinton’s 2008 budget vote We never heard back from the Republican Party of Florida for evidence of this claim, but we did find the likely explanation from the Republican National Committee, which made a similar claim Aug. 17, 2016. The GOP cites a March 14, 2008, vote, when Clinton joined Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Olympia Snow of Maine, in voting for Senate Continuing Resolution 70. The measure passed 51-44. Continuing Resolution 70 set the framework for the 2008-09 federal budget. It crafted a $3 trillion roadmap for lawmakers to follow in building the next year’s federal budget. It also created revenue markers for future years, so lawmakers could begin to contemplate how the budget picture may look down the road. If this reads like a mushy description, it is. As the New York Times put it at the time, the resolution -- and the companion passed in the House "are nonbinding and represent no formal action on either spending or taxes." Literally speaking, Clinton’s vote did nothing. ("Congress engages in $3 trillion political act," read the headline in the International Herald Tribune.) So how do Republicans claim CR 70 is evidence she voted to raise taxes on the middle class? Among the measures contained in CR 70 were revenue projections that assumed a number of temporary tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 would expire at the end of 2010. The resolution endorsed extending $340 billion worth of the tax cuts, the Associated Press reported at the time, but "balked at continuing all of them." Among the projected revenue changes that Clinton voted for, one would have raised the 25 percent tax bracket back to its pre-2001 level of 28 percent. At the time of the vote, that 25 percent tax bracket started at $32,551 for single filers and went up to $78,850. Because of deductions people are allowed to claim, someone would need to make $41,500 a year to fall into the 25 percent tax bracket. A misleading attack There are several problems with this claim, however. Clinton’s vote was nonbinding. As we already mentioned, the vote didn’t affect people’s pocketbooks. CR 70 had no binding impact on the tax policy in the United States in 2008, 2009 or any year after that. The Bush tax cuts weren’t set to expire until the end of 2010. Clinton and everyone else knew that the Bush-era tax cuts wouldn’t expire until the end of 2010, when a new Congress and president would be in office. That means a different set of lawmakers would ultimately decide the fate of the tax cuts. In fact, it was a key point during the 2008 presidential election. Clinton the candidate wanted to extend the Bush-era cuts for people making less than $250,000 a year. Clinton, who was still seeking the Democratic nomination at the time of the vote, had promised to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans. "I am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle- class Americans, people making less than $250,000 a year," Clinton said at an ABC News debate in April 2008, a month after her vote on CR 70. "In fact, I have a very specific plan of $100 billion in tax cuts that would go to help people afford health care, security retirement plans, you know, make it possible for people to get long-term care insurance and care for their parents and grandparents who they are trying to support, making college affordable and so much else." Many of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were always scheduled to expire. From their initial passage, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts had a sunset provision. Again, in a literal sense, no vote was necessary to roll back many of the tax-cutting provisions. The laws were crafted to do that without any vote. William Gale, an economist at the Tax Policy Center and Brookings Institution, said allowing a temporary tax provision to expire is different from voting for a tax increase. "In both cases, taxes would go up, but if the claim is that she VOTED for it, that seems not right to me," Gale wrote in an email. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said on Facebook the Hillary Clinton "voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500." Clinton voted for a nonbinding Senate resolution in 2008 that envisioned a world where many of the Bush-era tax cuts would have been allowed to sunset, as intended, at the end of 2010. In that world, tax rates would have gone up for someone making about $41,500 a year. But Clinton also said that had she been elected president, she would not have supported such a change and promised not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. Neither action ultimately mattered -- Clinton’s vote didn’t carry the force of law and she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. The Republican Party of Florida’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-02236	Americans spend "6.1 billion hours a year" on tax preparation.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/15/virginia-foxx/it-takes-americans-61-billion-hours-prepare-their-/	Tax day has come around again, and with it a startling claim about the amount of time Americans spend doing their taxes each year. According to U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., it takes United States taxpayers a total of 6.1 billion hours to file their taxes. That adds up to more than 695,000 years. "6.1 Billion hours a year, just to figure out how much money the government is going to take," she said in a post on Twitter. We had to check to see if this number could possibly be accurate. According to Foxx’s office, the number comes from the Taxpayer Advocate Service’s 2013 report to Congress, which tackled the issue of the complexity of the U.S. tax code. "In 2012, the National Taxpayer Advocate has designated the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as one of the most serious problems facing taxpayers," the report reads. "The existing code, by our count, has reached nearly four million words and imposes unconscionable burden on taxpayers. Our analysis of IRS data indicates that individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax-filing requirements." It’s important to note that the report comes to the number by calculating the estimated combined time businesses and individuals spend filing taxes, not just that of private citizens. The Taxpayer Advocate Service is an independent group within the Internal Revenue Service that is tasked with helping "taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS and recommend changes that will prevent the problems." The number was calculated by multiplying the number of times each type of tax form was filed in 2010 by the amount of time the IRS estimates it takes to complete each form, according to Ken Drexler, a media relations officer at the Taxpayer Advocate Service. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires federal agencies to estimate the amount of time it takes to fill out a given piece of paperwork. "It’s the best number you can come up with, but it’s not necessarily a number you would take to the bank," Drexler said, noting it would take longer for someone unfamiliar with a form to complete it than someone who has done so many times before. Accountants and tax professionals, for example, could fill out the forms faster than an average filer. In other words, the estimate might have flaws, but it is the best guess as to the time it takes for businesses and individuals to fill out tax paperwork. In a 2011 report, the Laffer Center for Supply Side Economics further broke down the 6.1 billion hour figure, finding that individuals spend 3.16 billion of those hours filling out tax forms, while businesses clock in at 2.94 billion hours. The estimate has remained the same since 2010. In 2009, the Taxpayer Advocate Service concluded Americans spent a whopping 7.6 billion hours completing the forms. Our ruling Foxx said, "6.1 billion hours a year, just to figure out how much money the government is going to take." The number came from the Taxpayer Advocate Service’s 2013 report to Congress, which stated that individuals and businesses spent 6.1 billion hours preparing their taxes. It’s important to note that the figure is an estimate. It comes from taking the number of tax forms filed in the last year and multiplying it by the IRS’s estimate of the time it takes to prepare the forms. Foxx’s larger point, that it takes a very long time for Americans to comply with filing their federal taxes, is accurate. The number is an estimate, but it’s from a credible, independent report.

pomt-03371	Says proposed anti-abortion legislation "would force women facing the most personal of health decisions to endure a transvaginal ultrasound."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/jul/12/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-ohio-house-bill-would-r/	The anti-abortion provisions slipped into Ohio’s budget have been ratified, but the Republican-controlled legislature is still considering other efforts to restrict abortions. House Bill 200, introduced by Rep. Ron Hood and supported by 34 of his Republican colleagues, would double the state’s 24-hour waiting period for abortions, compel doctors to tell patients that having an abortion will increase risk of breast cancer and require women seeking abortions to undergo what some doctors say are medically unnecessary ultrasounds. Democrats and abortion-rights advocates have publicly denounced the measure. The Ohio Democratic Party sent out a statement blasting Hood’s bill, saying House Republicans are "legislating shame on Ohio’s women." "They introduced a bill that would force women facing the most personal of health decisions to endure a transvaginal ultrasound," said a statement by Liz Brown, deputy executive director of the Ohio Democratic Party. PolitiFact Ohio determined that Hood set his pants on fire when he used the bill to link an increased risk of breast cancer to abortions, but we wanted to find out if the Ohio Democratic Party is also guilty of propagating medical misinformation. Hood’s bill would require doctors to perform ultrasounds on women who request an abortion and to give patients a verbal description of the ultrasound, including an audible heartbeat, if available. The legislation does not specify what type of ultrasound must be performed beyond saying an "obstetric" ultrasound. The legislation says a doctor must perform an ultrasound that "portrays the entire body of the embryo or fetus" under threat of a first-degree felony charge and a fine of up to $1 million. Hood calls the measure the "Ultrasound Access Act." The legislation aims to "give every Ohio mother the opportunity to see an ultrasound photo of her baby before making an abortion decision," Hood said. So, would this "opportunity" force women to undergo a transvaginal, or internal, ultrasound? That depends, experts say. The Ohio Democratic Party told PolitiFact that the group got its information on transvaginal ultrasounds from a handful of sources, including "Prenatal Tests and Ultrasounds: The Facts" written by two ultrasound experts from a New Jersey-based OB/GYN medical practice. It also provided a study published in the journal "Seminars in Reproductive Medicine." The sources say that transvaginal ultrasounds are more accurate and are often used over external transabdominal ultrasounds during early pregnancy. "Not surprisingly, transvaginal ultrasound has been shown to be better at visualizing early pregnancy than is transabdominal ultrasound," according to the study. Some doctors say a transvaginal procedure, under certain circumstances, may be the only method that would provide the necessary image. Dr. Anita Somani, a physician at Comprehensive Women's Care in Columbus, said earlier this month during a press conference held by Democrats to decry HB 200 that in some cases an external transabdominal ultrasound could reveal an embryo or fetus in its entirety. But, depending on the age of the embryo or fetus and the patient’s body type, a transvaginal ultrasound may be needed to comply with the legislation, Somani said. "You may not see anything on a transabdominal ultrasound until a woman is further along in her pregnancy," Somani said, adding that a transabdominal ultrasound is not likely to produce an accurate image of a fetus or embryo during the first trimester. Like a judicious patient, PolitiFact wanted a second opinion. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a San Francisco-area physician and vice president of research for the sexual and reproductive rights group Ibis Reproductive Health, concurred with Somani’s assessment. In most cases, the only way to get a clear and detailed image of the embryo or fetus during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy is to perform an "invasive, uncomfortable" transvaginal ultrasound, Grossman said. "It’s a medical procedure that is not always required to perform an abortion," Grossman said. "Like any medical test or procedure, it should be performed at the physician’s discretion." And why not seek a third opinion, just for good measure? Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said a transvaginal ultrasound gives a very close-up picture of the ovaries and inside the uterus, whereas a transabdominal ultrasound gives a wider view. "If it is very early in the pregnancy, to see if there is a living embryo, you would need a transvaginal ultrasound," Harrison said, adding that the internal procedure would be needed to accurately date a pregnancy in the first nine weeks. The statement by the Ohio Democratic Party implies that all women seeking abortions would be forced to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound. Women seeking abortions would have to undergo some form of ultrasound, and many women seeking early-term abortions could face the internal procedure. But the Ohio Democratic Party did not clarify the circumstances. We rate its claim Half True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-07-12T06:00:00	2013-07-14	['None']
pomt-01219	In rural Virginia, "Sen. Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/21/david-hallock/mark-warner-got-more-rural-votes-other-democratic-/	Plenty of Monday morning quarterbacks attended a recent seminar where a political adviser to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner and one for Republican Ed Gillespie looked back on Virginia’s surprisingly close U.S. Senate election. A woman in the audience at George Mason University asked if Warner’s margin of victory -- less than 18,000 votes out of almost 2.2 million cast -- would have been greater if the senator had spent less time campaigning in rural areas and more time stumping in populous Northern Virginia, a haven for statewide Democratic candidates. The woman was echoing a question raised by many pundits after the election. David Hallock, a Warner adviser, replied that rural votes helped Warner win. "You look at the kind of Republican areas, the rural areas, Senator Warner ran 8-10 points ahead of a traditional Democrat -- ahead of Senator Kaine, ahead of Governor McAuliffe in those areas -- which is more than the margin of victory at the end of the day," he said. Warner has long prided himself as a vote-getter in rural Virginia, pursuing a so-called "Bubba strategy," attending NASCAR races and even commissioning a blue-grass campaign song during his successful 2001 run for governor. We examined whether Warner this year really did top the past rural vote performances of two stalwarts in his party -- Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Terry McAuliffe -- by the 8-10 percent margin Hallock cited. The first step was to define rural Virginia. We relied on a state map highlighting 52 localities that the federal government defines as rural. Then, we compared Warner’s 2014 votes in those places to the results from McAuliffe’s 2013 gubernatorial election and Kaine’s 2012 Senate contest. Here’s how the statewide rural vote broke down: Warner, 2014: 39 percent McAuliffe, 2013: 35.6 percent Kaine, 2012: 41.4 percent The rural localities form six regions. Here’s how Warner’s performance compared to the other Democrats in each of those areas: Eastern Shore: Warner, 44.2 percent; McAuliffe, 42.8 percent; Kaine, 50.3 percent. Northern Neck: Warner, 41.2 percent; McAuliffe, 39.1 percent; Kaine, 45.8 percent. Shenandoah: Warner, 33.3 percent, McAuliffe, 34 percent; Kaine, 39.9 percent. Alleghany: Warner, 37.1 percent; McAuliffe, 33.4 percent; Kaine, 38.5 percent. Southside: Warner, 48.5 percent; McAuliffe, 45.3 percent; Kaine, 51.3 percent. Southwest: Warner, 35.9 percent; McAuliffe, 29.7 percent; Kaine, 35.3 percent. The 39 percent overall rural vote for Warner this fall was considerably below the level he achieved during his other successful campaigns. Warner got 61.2 percent of the rural vote in his 2008 landslide victory for the U.S. Senate over Republican Jim Gilmore; he got 51.2 percent in his 2001 gubernatorial win over Republican Mark Earley. Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said the decline in Warner’s vote percentages this year -- not just in rural areas but across Virginia -- may be due to the senator’s positioning as a centrist. "The moderate strategy that worked so well for Warner back in the day, just doesn’t work as well today," Farnsworth said. "The real polarization of politics means there’s just not as many people interested in a moderate politician. The strategy of winning over moderate rural voters doesn’t work well when there aren’t many moderate rural voters." As we mentioned, a number of pundits question whether some of Warner’s time courting rural voters would have been better spent wooing Northern Virginians. We’re not taking sides in this debate, but thought we’d offer a few statistics to put it in perspective. Unofficially, Warner won by 17,723 votes. The State Board of Elections is scheduled the certify the final results on Monday. In rural Virginia, Gillespie got 163,608 votes and Warner received 108,772. Gillespie won a 54,386-vote edge. In Northern Virginia, Warner gained 358,878 votes, 57.4 percent, and Gillespie got 252,584 votes, 40.4 percent. Warner won a 106,294-vote advantage in the region. Our ruling Hallock said Warner, in this fall’s Senate election, ran "8-10 points ahead" of past performances by fellow Democrats McAuliffe and Kaine in rural Virginia. He’s flat out wrong. McAuliffe’s portion of the rural vote, in his 2013 gubernatorial victory, was 3.6 percentage points below Warner’s. Kaine’s slice of the rural vote, in his 2012 Senate win, was 2.4 percentage points above Warner’s. We rate Hallock’s statement False. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said Hallock did not respond to three emails seeking data for his claim. Our requests were sent to an incorrect email address for Hallock.

pomt-14321	When it comes to fighting terrorism, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/30/hillary-clinton/evidence-backs-hillary-clinton-claim-torture-count/	The day after the March 22 terrorist attack in Brussels, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Stanford University talking about ISIS, the threat of terrorism and whether torture is a useful tool to fight it. "One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims," she said, adding, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture." "Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk," Clinton said. Most of us can see ourselves spilling the beans on anything and everything if we were subjected to the kinds of "enhanced interrogation techniques" that suspected terrorists have been subjected to by the United States since 9/11. We wondered if, as Clinton contended, it has been well established that torture does not work. Tell them what they want to hear Because nobody's going to volunteer to be part of a scientific study where you might get tortured — ethics review boards might be apoplectic about such a proposal — the only way to examine the issue is through case studies. The experts with whom we spoke said that, for a host of reasons, torture has long been recognized as an inefficient way to get information. The biggest problem is that it tends to produce wrong information. The United States Army Field Manual warns that information gathered by torture can be faulty. That's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear. "It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements," said Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.) One example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida's chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. Critics say that's because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged. Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had "information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11," said Hajjar in a review article in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. "This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop." Bad truth detectors Interrogators aren’t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth. "Interrogators in these situations think they're perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently," said Darius Rejali, a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability "make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin." In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated, the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence. "The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don't know anything, and they're claiming that they do," said Rejali. That opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture informants. "Sleep deprivation will make you imagine you were there shooting (President John) Kennedy behind the grassy knoll," said Rejali. Another issue is that news reports of torture turn public opinion against authorities who condone or permit torture. Rejali cited the cases of a 2005 bombing attempt in London. When video of the bomber aired, "the parents came forward and said, 'He's our son. He's the killer.' Would the parents have come forward if they knew their son was going to be tortured? You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no." "Not only does torture undermine what we know works, which is public cooperation, but it can also deeply alter the duration, severity and cost of a conflict," he said. "Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts," said Hajjar. Senate torture report When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released when Democrats controlled the Senate. The full document, about 6,700 pages and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014. There's also a minority report developed by Republicans on the committee and a CIA response. The majority report says techniques such as waterboarding, standing sleep deprivation, forced feeding through a rectal tube, temperature extremes and confinement in coffin-sized boxes were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The committee's analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly "saved lives" — cited by the CIA and the Bush administration — found either that the key information was gathered before torture began, the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated, or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees. For example, the majority report says that "CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports." Another example: The CIA said Ghul, the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden, had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information. The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation. Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation — described by the president as tough, safe, lawful and necessary — produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked. The minority report says that in many of the 20 cases, enhanced interrogation tactics did produce significant breakthroughs, although sometimes as part of a delayed cascade effect. The problem with most of the accounts of people who say that torture works, said Rejali, is that only the cases where it seemed to succeed are remembered and the ones where it didn't are forgotten. "In the two and a half years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies arrested more that 5,000 suspected terrorists," said Mark Costanzo of Claremont McKenna College and Ellen Gerrity of Duke University, writing in the journal Social Issues and Policy Review. "There was sufficient hard evidence to bring formal charges against only three of these suspects, and only one of these three was convicted." Our ruling Clinton said that when it comes to fighting terrorism, "Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture." When it comes to the real goal of getting useful intelligence, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the details interrogators will get from a detainee can typically be acquired without torture. When torture is used, the "information" extracted is likely to be fiction created by a prisoner who will say anything to get the punishment to stop. All ethical issues aside, the experts say, it doesn't work because it is extremely inefficient and, in many ways, counterproductive. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14653	"According to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/22/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsins-high-school-graduatio/	State of the State addresses tend to be bursting with boasts and brags. But given the preparation that goes into such speeches, claims made in them are probably more likely to be on target than off-the-cuff remarks. That’s essentially what we have with one in a string of education boasts made by Gov. Scott Walker during his sixth State of the State, given Jan. 19, 2016. "In our state, fourth- and eighth-grade reading scores went up again in 2015," the governor said. "And according to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to the third-best in the country." Given the nature of his speech, Walker clearly was taking some credit for the graduation rate apparently rising and the ranking being so high. Let’s take a look. Old claim, new claim Walker made a similar statement in April 2014. He said the state’s high school graduation rate and third-grade reading scores had improved on his watch. Our rating was Mostly True. Both numbers were up since 2010, the year before Walker took office. But some credit could have been to due prior elected officials, and the trend lines hadn’t changed much going back to prior to 2010. The graduation rate covers students in public high schools who earn a regular diploma within four years of starting high school. To back Walker’s new claim, his office cited an October 2015 news release from the state Department of Public Instruction about the latest graduation data. The release said federal data released that month showed Wisconsin’s graduation rate for the 2013-’14 school year was 88.6 percent. That rate was up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year, ranking Wisconsin third in the country, according to the release. Here’s how the federal data listed the top states: Public high school graduation rate, 2013-’14 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 90.5% 2. Nebraska 89.7% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and New Jersey 88.6% Now the federal data for the previous school year: Public high school graduation rate, 2012-’13 school year Rank/State Rate 1. Iowa 89.7% 2. Nebraska 88.5% 3. (tie) Wisconsin and Texas 88% So, Wisconsin’s graduation rate did improve, but its rank did not. Our rating Walker said: "According to the most recent report, Wisconsin’s high school graduation rates are also up again -- to third best in the country." The latest-available graduation rate for public high school students in Wisconsin was 88.6 percent in the 2013-’14 school year. That’s up sixth-tenths of a percentage point from the previous year. But Wisconsin’s rank -- third -- did not change. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. More on education Wisconsin Democratic Party: Wisconsin dropped "from second in the country to 41st" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam. Pants on Fire. Activist Scot Ross: Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin "moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt." Mostly False. Lawmaker Jennifer Shilling: A "voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening." Mostly True.

pomt-14567	"Making public colleges and universities tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea/	Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are battling for the "most progressive" label in the Democratic presidential primary, and for Sanders that includes his call for free tuition at public colleges and universities. During the Feb. 4 debate in New Hampshire, Sanders argued that there is a precedent for free tuition in the United States and overseas. "Now, all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas," Sanders said. "Making public colleges and universities tuition-free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States." How common is free college tuition worldwide and did it used to exist in the United States? College costs overseas A spokesman for Sanders referred us to a 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development, a group that compares data on a variety of topics in advanced industrial nations. We obtained the 2015 report from OECD that showed the number of countries with no tuition as of 2013-14: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden and Turkey. Germany also now has free tuition at public universities, although students pay some fees. "Yes, it’s free -- it’s the German taxpayer paying for it," said Peter Kerrigan, deputy director of German Academic Exchange Service. "Somebody is footing the bill. It’s just not the student." For the Nordic countries that charge no tuition, individuals face high income tax rates. The approach to funding higher education "reflects these countries’ deeply rooted social values, such as equality of opportunity and social equity," states an OECD report. College tuition in the U.S. College tuition has never been set on a nationwide basis, said John R. Thelin, professor at the University of Kentucky and author of A History of American Higher Education. Instead, it has been set by each state or college and is subject to approval by the legislature or board of trustees. However, there are examples of some colleges or universities offering free tuition decades ago, especially universities established through federal land grants starting in the 1860s. "Public colleges and universities were often free at their founding in the United States, but over time, as public support was reduced or not increased sufficiently to compensate for their growth in students and costs (faculty and staff salaries, utilities etc.), they moved first to a low tuition and eventually higher tuition policy," said Cornell University professor Ronald Gordon Ehrenberg. For example, California offered free tuition to in-state students until the 1970s, although it charged an "incidental fee" starting in 1921. Baruch College in New York was founded in 1847 as the Free Academy, the first free public institution of higher education in the nation, according to the college, which is now part of the City University system of New York. At least some students were paying by the early 20th century, and 1976 marked the end of any tuition-free policy. At the University of Florida, a school catalog from 1905-06 stated: "No tuition is charged to students whose home is in Florida. All other students will be required to pay a tuition fee of twenty ($20) dollars per year." Public higher education was often free when a very small percentage of students attended, said Roger L. Geiger, education professor at Penn State and author of The History of American Higher Education: Learning and Culture from the Founding to World War II. "Historically, many individual institutions refrained from student charges, including early Stanford. Community colleges were often free, being considered an extension of secondary schools." he said. In Sanders’ home state at the University of Vermont, a book about the school’s history indicates that tuition was charged in the 19th century. Senior class tuition was $8.34 in 1827. "I don't think there was ever a time that UVM did not charge tuition," said Jeffrey D. Marshall, director of research collections. Sanders talked about public colleges, but we heard about at least one private university that offered free tuition for decades: Rice Institute, later which became Rice University. That university in Texas charged tuition for the first time in 1965. There are also a few small private colleges or universities that are tuition free today, such as Berea College. Our ruling Sanders said, "Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States." There are at least nine advanced countries that offer free college, including the recent addition of Germany. There was a time in the United States when some public colleges and universities charged no tuition. However, tuition has never been set as a national policy -- it is a decision for each school or state government officials. And some colleges charged tuition dating back to the 1800s. Sanders' statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12748	Says his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/01/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-historic-defense-increase/	In his address to Congress, President Donald Trump said his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney gave reporters a broad overview of the president’s budget Feb. 27. He said the White House wants to spend $603 billion on defense. Mulvaney compared that to the $549 billion allowed under spending caps based on a 2011 budget control law. On that basis, Trump seeks nearly a 10 percent increase. But when we looked at past budgets, we found there have been much heftier jumps in military spending. As America entered WWII, its defense spending more than doubled. However, that was a world war, so a fairer comparison might be more recent budgets. But even over the past 35 years, Trump’s plan still isn’t exceptional. A word of caution: Making apples-to-apples comparisons in defense spending can be tricky. Budget writers talk about the base defense budget. That number excludes billions for Overseas Contingency Operations, a big ticket item that covers the costs of actually fighting wars. Right now, that spending adds about $55 billion to the Pentagon’s account. When the contingency money is factored in, spending today is about $587 billion. This difference can lead to some confusion as people debate the magnitude of Trump’s request. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Trump’s plan raises the Pentagon’s budget by only about $18 billion. But he’s comparing Trump’s apparent base request to the full Pentagon budget. So with that in mind, let’s go back in time. President Jimmy Carter’s last budget kicked up military spending 25 percent in 1981. President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised it by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, had a tempered view of Trump’s assertion. "The defense budget Trump proposed for 2018 is a significant increase, but it is not one of the largest increases," Harrison told PolitiFact. During Trump's speech, Harrison tweeted this chart, which excludes war-related money. By Harrison’s count, since 1977, there have been 10 increases that were at least a little bit larger than what Trump has in mind. Laicie Heeley, a defense budget analyst at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said, "Trump's historical increase is actually quite average." We reached out to the White House and were still waiting for a response when we published. Our ruling Trump said his budget plan has one of the largest increases in defense spending in the country’s history. Looking strictly at money for the Pentagon’s base budget, Trump is calling for about a 10 percent hike in spending. But in the past three decades, there have been 10 years when the base defense budget has gone up more than what Trump has requested. In some years, the increase was more than double Trump’s. The term "one of the largest" has some leeway, but the defense analysts we reached said while it is a significant increase, it is not remarkable.

A headline on a July 11, 2017, post on Wazanews.tk read, "There was someone else on that plane for the secret Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch meeting." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post is based on a real June 27, 2016, meeting Clinton and Lynch had on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, which drew fire because former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was under investigation for keeping a private email server. Supposedly new information about the meeting came to light, the post said. A Baltimore Morning News reporter determined from flight paperwork that Ryan traveled with Lynch to Phoenix, specifically to attend the meeting with Clinton. The story launched into several melodramatic theories why the trio were meeting, including possibly brokering then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s "freedom at the expense of an embarrassing national election loss." There’s no newspaper called the Baltimore Morning News, and there’s no proof Ryan was at all involved in the meeting, because the story is fake. Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the story appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, which makes up its content. OurLandOfTheFree.com said it "makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality." There is no contact information readily available on the site. The site followed up this story about Ryan joining Clinton and Lynch with several more posts. One said a Justice Department pilot was going to spill the beans about the meeting on Fox News, but ended up being found dead (but not before leaving behind details of the discussion). Again, none of it is true. This is another example of a series of fake stories attempting to fool readers with a bogus saga about an oft-cited political event. We rate the claim Pants On Fire!

His full quote: "The Z-visa that was offered in that Senate bill let everybody who's here illegally, other than criminals, stay here for the rest of their lives. And that may not be technically amnesty, but it is certainly amnesty in fact." But that's an inaccurate description of the bill. Only immigrants who meet certain requirements will be able to stay here "for the rest of their lives." For instance, immigrants who have entered before January 1, 2007 are eligible to apply for Z visas. AND Romney is incorrect in stating that illegal immigrants who wish to remain in the U.S. must only prove that they are not criminals. Illegal immigrants who wish to work in the U.S. must pass a background check, pay fines, be consistently employed, and pay taxes. Those seeking permanent citizenship must return to their country of origin and apply for permanent resident status through their applicant as well as pay a $4,000 application fee.

State financing per URI student has fallen by an inflation-adjusted 47 percent since 2002, one national report said last year. State Sen. Dawson T. Hodgson, R-North Kingstown, raised the issue in a Jan. 3, 2012, radio interview on WPRO-AM. Hodgson talked about the state budget as more than a financial document, but, rather, as a statement of values and priorities. In that vein, he noted, "the amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island." We hit the books to see whether the legislature-URI comparison passes the test. We called Hodgson, who said he would supply figu res the next day. In the meantime, we checked with Robert A. Weygand, URI's vice president of administration and finance, who walked us through university budget documents showing that the state contributed $58.1 million for URI operations this fiscal year. Weygand said that if you factor in state contributions used to pay debt on voter-approved bonds for some university buildings -- money URI doesn’t see for yearly operations -- the total state contribution would be about $77.3 million. State Budget Officer Thomas Mullaney told us the part-time legislature was budgeted to receive $37.2 million in state funding this year. Adding in federal funds brings that to $38.8 million. And money not spent last year brings this year’s total budget to about $40.4 million, he said. The state funding pays for day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives and Senate, mostly for salaries for staff such as legislative pages and researchers. When we heard from Hodgson by e-mail, he provided figures showing the same $58.1-million that Weygand cited for the state’s contribution to URI and $38.8 million for the legislature. Any way you crunch the numbers, the state’s contribution to URI is still many millions of dollars more than what it is for the legislature, not nearly the same, as Hodgson said. Hodgson said the context for his statement on the radio is important, noting that the state’s contribution to URI amounts to little more than 8 percent of the university’s $706-million budget. "I believe that investing in public higher education must be a priority for sustained economic growth, and I am not satisfied with the value we are getting for our money from our part-time legislature," Hodgson said by e-mail. Our ruling Dawson Hodgson said, "The amount of money that we put into running our own state legislature is nearly as much as we put into the University of Rhode Island." In fact, the state contributes $58 million to URI, roughly $20 million more than the legislature’s budget. That’s not "nearly as much." Whether Hodgson’s point about budget priorities is valid or not, he got the numbers wrong. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12912	"Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/18/carlos-guillermo-smith/after-fort-lauderdale-airport-shooting-legislator-/	The suspect in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport told the FBI in Alaska in November that he was hearing voices. Anchorage police confiscated Esteban Santiago’s handgun and took him for a mental health evaluation. Police returned his gun to him in December when he asked for it. On Jan. 6, he flew to Broward County and is the suspected gunman in a rampage at the airport that left five dead and several others injured. Days later, Democratic state legislators held a press conference in Tallahassee to argue for gun control measures and more mental health funding. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said that Republican legislators argue that the way to reduce gun violence is not through gun control but mental health care funding. But Florida, he said, has the worst record in the nation in terms of funding mental health care treatment. "We see once again Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding — 50th," he said. "There is no one that is doing worse than we are when it comes to making sure we that we are providing comprehensive mental health care." Florida is near the bottom of the pack in mental health funding, and one key ranking cited by many experts places the state at 51st in per capita spending. However, there are some caveats about the ranking. Comparing state mental health funding Smith pointed to news articles about Florida’s low ranking on mental health funding and data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. Mental health funding experts said they consider the institute’s data as the best source. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. The most recent data, for fiscal year 2014, showed Florida ranked 51st out of 52 jurisdictions for total state mental health spending — behind 49 states and Washington, D.C. — at $36.05 per capita. The Sunshine State was only ahead of one jurisdiction: Puerto Rico, at $20.22. Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, said Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute. In general, states in the northeast and northwest spend more, while southern states spend much less, he said. One key caveat about this data: It is based on money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families, and it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. "Those additional funding sources aren’t reported to DCF, but they’re still used within the local systems of care to treat individuals," said Jessica Sims, DCF spokeswoman. The national research institute asks the state mental health authority in each state to provide information on all the funds used for its public mental health provider system, including state psychiatric hospitals and community providers. If another state agency uses Medicaid funds to pay for services directly and doesn’t work with the state mental health authority, then the state mental health authority will not have that data, Lutterman said. In most states, the state mental health authority helps manage the Medicaid funds. However Florida administers Medicaid differently, Lutterman said, and therefore isn’t able to report the Medicaid data for this report. The National Alliance on Mental Illness uses the per-capita state expenditures to compare rankings, said the alliance’s spokesman Bob Carolla. "It reflects the relative degree of commitment to mental health by the state," he said. "Medicaid dollars compared to Medicaid dollars could be a separate indicator, except I believe it’s more problematic because of the differences that exist between the state Medicaid programs." Florida lags behind the majority of states on Medicaid spending per enrollee and the state Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act. Another way to examine mental health funding is to look at whether states are increasing the amount each year. The National Alliance on Mental Illness annual survey of state mental health care legislation doesn’t rank states but shows general budgeting trends. The 2015 report shows Florida maintained funding in 2013 and increased it in 2014 and 2015. Our ruling Smith said, "Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding." A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. That data shows that Florida ranked 51st in 2014. However, it is difficult to compare Florida with other states because it administers its Medicaid program differently than most states.

pomt-12578	California will have the "highest gas tax in the nation" once its 12 cent gas tax hike goes into effect.	false	/california/statements/2017/apr/11/jim-patterson/will-california-soon-have-highest-gas-tax-nation/	Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson of Fresno recently claimed California would soon have the "highest gas tax in the nation." He made the claim in a press release days after the California Legislature passed a 12 cent per gallon gasoline tax hike, part of a funding package to raise billions of dollars for state road repairs. "The $52 billion tax will also put Californians in a special, yet unenviable category – drivers who pay the highest gas tax in the nation," Patterson said in the release issued April 10, 2017. With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s signature the bill will go into effect in November. The Golden State’s per gallon gas tax is already high. We set out to fact-check whether it really will be the highest in the country. Our research Asked for evidence, Patterson’s spokeswoman pointed us to a map showing state-by-state gasoline tax rates produced in March 2016 by the nonprofit Tax Foundation. That map and its numbers, however, are outdated. A map produced in January 2017 by the foundation includes the most current state-by-state gas tax rates. Those rates are calculated by adding up state and local gas taxes and fees. It shows Pennsylvania has the highest per gallon tax rate in the nation at more than 58 cents. California’s current per gallon tax is about 38 cents per gallon, the seventh highest in the nation. Do the arithmetic: Even with the 12-cent increase, California’s tax will trail Pennsylvania’s by 8 cents per gallon. "You won’t be No. 1, that’s for sure," said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. "Pennsylvania will still be the highest." A chart produced in January 2017 by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, confirms the tax foundation’s figures, though it adds in the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax for each state. Based on current rates, California’s increase will likely result in the second highest state gas tax in the nation, ahead of Washington and Hawaii. This second highest tax ranking could leave California with the highest overall gas prices at the pump, according to energy analysts. We looked at that topic in a recent article. As of this week, California’s average price was $2.99 per gallon. It trailed only Hawaii’s $3.04, for a margin of about 5 cents per gallon. The 12 cent per gallon increase could cause California to leap-frog Hawaii, analysts said. Joe Henchman, a vice president with the Tax Foundation, noted that California also adds a 2.25 percent sales tax on gasoline. This sales tax is not counted by the foundation or the petroleum institute as part of the state’s gas tax. But based on the current price of gasoline in the state, it represents about 6 or 7 cents per gallon in tax, which "would not entirely close the gap with Pennsylvania," Henchman said. Five other states charge a sales tax on gasoline: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana and Illinois. Pennsylvania does not. Our ruling Republican State Assemblyman Jim Patterson claimed California’s recent gas tax increase, once approved by Gov. Jerry Brown as expected, would result in the "highest gas tax in the nation." Patterson relied on outdated gas tax rates. Current figures from the Tax Foundation show California’s per gallon gas tax will still trail Pennsylvania’s rate by more than 6 cents, even after the tax hike goes into effect in November. California would likely move from seventh highest to second in the nation. These figures are also confirmed by the American Petroleum Institute. In the end, we rate Patterson’s claim False. UPDATE: This fact-check has been updated with comments from Joe Henchman of the Tax Foundation about the sales tax California charges on gasoline. The foundation provided us a second update later in April 2017 that accounted for an additional and less-publicized gas tax increase under California’s new legislation. It concluded "Pennsylvania will still be highest, but by a narrower margin." This latest update factors in an additional 7.5 cent per gallon gas tax increase that would start in July 2019. This is on top of the 12 cent per gallon hike that would go into effect in November. The state’s full gas tax increase would amount to 19.5 cents per gallon by this time. California’s overall gas tax would climb to 58.3 cents per gallon under the foundation’s latest calculations. We continue to rate Patterson's claim as False as the foundation concluded this higher California gas tax, even in 2019, would be "just behind Pennsylvania's highest-in-the-nation 59.3 (cents-per-gallon) tax."

pomt-10719	"The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/mitt-romney/overall-violence-declined-under-romney/	After Rudy Giuliani attacked Mitt Romney for rising crime rates in Massachusetts, Romney shot back: "The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent. So he's wrong again on the facts." Take apart the FBI crime figures, and you'll see that Romney is right. But Giuliani is also right on a couple of points, particularly on rising murder and robberies. Here's how the numbers break down: Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing FBI crime statistics in Massachusetts for 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed during the Romney administration. To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims. But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies. Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9. Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, an increase of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125. So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent. Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up. Romney is correct when he says violent crime in Massachusetts declined, so we rate his claim True.

pomt-11934	The Obama administration "borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-linkage-between-stock-gai/	President Donald Trump raised eyebrows with comments linking stock market gains with declines in the federal debt during two appearances to tout his tax proposal in Pennsylvania. First, in an Oct. 11 speech in an airplane hangar in Harrisburg, Trump said: "Just in the stock market alone, we have increased our economic worth by $5.2 trillion. That's right since Election Day -- $5.2 trillion. Think about that. That's a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. … In the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled. … But since the election on Nov. 8, I've increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. You haven't heard those numbers." During a subsequent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump made the linkage between stock market gains and debt decreases even clearer. "The country — we took it over and owed over 20 trillion. As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up 5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt." We decided to look into whether Trump had a point that the stock market gains on his watch effectively wiped out any of the debt incurred by his predecessor, Barack Obama. (The White House did not provide any further information to PolitiFact.) Trump is somewhat off-base with those numbers. But the bigger problem is that the stock market gains and the debt don’t have the relationship he implies. Wealth gains and federal debt are distinct As of Oct. 12, the most expansive figure for the federal debt is almost $20.4 trillion. About $9.2 trillion of that came between the inaugurations of President Barack Obama and Trump. So that wasn’t "more than $10 trillion," and it wasn’t double the cumulative debt when he took office. The increase in stock market values may also be a little high. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, told the Financial Post that the value has risen by about $4.4 trillion since the election. However, stock market gains accrue to stockholders; the government doesn’t get any of those increases to pay for government spending or to pay down the debt unless and until the assets are sold and taxed. (Only a communist government can seize private assets to pay down the debt.) So gaining a $5 trillion boost in stock values doesn’t simply enable the country to write off that much of its $20 trillion debt. "The president is conflating the stock market, which represents the wealth of private corporations, with the federal budget," said Chris Lafakis, director at Moody’s Analytics. "There is not a direct link between the two." The taxation of such assets is delayed until the asset is sold, which could take years. "At best, a small share of the increase in equity value will, some day, lead to higher capital gains taxes," said Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. And the rates at which such assets are taxed -- capital gains rates -- are relatively low compared to other forms of income taxes. "With a tax rate on capital gains of 15 percent, even if all the stocks that have risen were sold tomorrow, the federal government would only reap at most 15 percent of the $5 trillion in asset gain," said added Bruce Bartlett, who served as deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush. And some of these gains may never be taxed. That could be the case if the holdings are passed on to heirs in a modestly sized estate, or if they are held institutionally, such as by a university. Other gains may have accrued to pension funds, and taxes would only be paid when the pensions are paid out and taxed by the recipient. The actual gain to the Treasury stemming from this stock run-up "is completely out of whack" with what Trump suggests, Lafakis said. "We’re talking about tens of billions, maybe even over $100 billion in extra revenues if you adopt very extreme assumptions," he said. "That doesn’t even stop our debt from going up, let alone pay down a meaningful portion of it." All of this, of course, assumes that stock values, which fluctuate minute by minute, won’t fall. Since Election Day, the Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. stocks has risen by about 19 percent -- an impressive gain. But if we put this in context, other international stock markets have done even better. Specifically, Germany’s DAX has risen by 24 percent over the same period. France’s CAC 40 and the Netherlands’ AEX indexes have both risen by 20 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index has risen by 22 percent, and both Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and South Korea’s KOSPI have risen by 24 percent. Another nuance Trump didn’t capture: The lines between debt and wealth can be complicated. About one-third of the federal debt is held by foreign entities, but much of the rest is held by Americans -- and those federal bondholders count that "debt" on their own ledgers as "wealth." Meanwhile, some fraction of the stocks that produced the equity gains Trump refers to are held by foreigners. Using Trump’s logic, Obama can claim credit for gains on his watch, too From Obama’s inauguration through Oct. 12, 2009, the Standard & Poor’s index increased by a whopping 34 percent, outpacing Trump’s 19 percent over the same portion of his presidency. The circumstances were different, of course -- Obama started at an economic low point while Trump inherited a healthily growing economy -- but the economy went on to strengthen under Obama over the long term. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the final quarter of 2016, Americans’ net worth increased from $55 trillion to $92 trillion. (This figure encompasses stock market values, home and property values, and changes in the indebtedness of U.S. households.) That’s an increase of two-thirds over eight years, or $37 trillion in raw dollars. So under Obama, wealth increased by an amount four times as large as the increase in the federal debt. But, for the reasons we explained, the wealth gains could not be directly applied to reduce the debt. "By President Trump's own reasoning, the Obama administration was an enormous success," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "The success has continued, so far, in the first nine months of the Trump administration." In the meantime, some argue that the creation of certain types of debt under Obama -- the deficit-financed expenditures for the fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession, for instance -- helped produce the stock-price run-up under both Obama and Trump. "One could argue that without the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the economy would have been far weaker in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and stock market valuations would have been lower," Lafakis said. "So in that instance, increasing the debt helped the stock market." Our ruling Trump said the Obama administration "borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt." Trump seems to be signaling that the stock market gains can somehow be applied to paying down the debt. That’s not the case -- gains from a bull market accrue to stockholders, and the government doesn’t get its fractional cut until the assets are sold and taxed, if they ever are. So, whatever tax revenues from the stock-market run-up eventually flow to the government over the course of many years won’t make a dent in the debt, economists say. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12456	In the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/09/barry-loudermilk/would-gop-bill-expand-womens-health-care-curbing-p/	Moments after the House passed a bill to significantly overhaul the nation’s health care system, Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., blasted an email to constituents. While the bill "doesn’t fix the entire problem," he said, it "begins the process of fixing our broken health care system." A PolitiFact reader sent us a copy of Loudermilk’s email and asked us to fact-check it. We zeroed in on one of the exchanges in a "frequently asked questions" section that sought to explain some of the bill’s provisions: "Why are you cutting women’s health services?" "We’re not. In fact, we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics." Could pushing Planned Parenthood out of the picture really expand women’s access to health care? We found that there are indeed more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics -- but that doesn’t mean that redirecting dollars to them will amount to "expanding women’s access to health services." Some background The GOP health care bill bill would effectively block Planned Parenthood for a year from securing reimbursements from Medicaid -- not just for abortions, which is already the case, but for any services, from pap smears to birth control. Planned Parenthood says abortion services are already walled off from payments they get for services that have nothing to do with abortion. But abortion opponents have long argued that the government is tacitly supporting abortion even by reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion services, saying such money is fungible once it reaches Planned Parenthood’s coffers. The bill’s change could have a significant impact on Planned Parenthood: About 43 percent of the group’s budget comes from the government, including grants and reimbursements, much of which comes from Medicaid. The group says the bill, if enacted, could lead to closures of clinics and leave women without access to vital services, especially in medically underserved areas. Do community health centers "vastly outnumber" Planned Parenthood clinics? Loudermilk has a point on the numbers of clinics. We looked at a census of clinics that provide contraceptive services published in April 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health nonprofit. The group tallied up various types of clinics, the most numerous of which are "federally qualified health centers" -- defined by the federal government as "safety-net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic." Such facilities can include community health centers, migrant health centers, homeless health care centers, and public housing primary care centers. For 2015, the census tallied 5,829 federally qualified health centers nationally, compared to 676 Planned Parenthood clinics. That’s a ratio of greater than 8-to-1, so the adjective "vastly" seems appropriate. Would the bill redirect money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers? Not necessarily. Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015 for its services; the group, however, does not make public what portion of that is specifically from the federal government because the funding streams from different levels of government are sometimes hard to disentangle. The best estimate we can get comes from the Congressional Budget Office, which projected that the provision blocking federal funding to Planned Parenthood would result in $178 million in reduced federal outlays. If the CBO’s projection is accurate, then the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill -- $422 million -- would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood. At first glance, that would seem to make the bill a net expansion in dollars, if you consider only these two line items. However, a couple issues balance against the notion that that this will represent an expansion of care. First, there is no guarantee that the $422 million spent would go towards the same patients, and for the same services, that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. The bill does not explicitly require that. Another caveat comes from a different conclusion in the same CBO analysis. "To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies," CBO wrote. "The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care." The immediate loss of care for 15 percent of Planned Parenthood patients also undercuts the argument that money would simply flow from one type of clinic to the other. Would redirecting funding to these centers expand women’s access to health services? There’s reason to be skeptical. For starters, common sense suggests that even if community health centers ended up being able to serve every single patient currently served by Planned Parenthood, that wouldn’t qualify as "expanding women’s access to health services" -- it would simply be maintaining it. The closure of as many as 676 Planned Parenthood facilities would require an awful lot of expansion of resources elsewhere just to keep pace, before any "expansion" of access begins. And there’s reason to believe that community health centers may not be able to pick up the slack if Planned Parenthood centers disappear. First, there’s a capacity problem. Planned Parenthood centers tend to be unusually efficient in providing health services to women, because that’s their specialty. The average Planned Parenthood clinic served 2,950 patients for contraceptive services in 2015, compared to 320 for the average federally qualified health center, according to the Guttmacher census. "Because by definition health centers are in medically underserved communities with elevated risk and insufficient primary care, the last thing one does is get rid of any supply," Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, told PolitiFact. "This is the corker. Health centers are overwhelmed with need." And currently, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making any rapid expansion that much trickier. "Workforce challenges are one of the primary barriers to health center patient growth," the National Association of Community Health Centers concluded in a 2016 report on its sector. "If all health center clinical vacancies were filled today, health centers could serve 2 million more patients." And second, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics aren’t interchangeable, experts say. Guttmacher data indicates that Planned Parenthood centers "are considerably more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods than sites operated by other types of agencies. Nearly all Planned Parenthood health centers offer the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved reversible contraceptive methods," compared to half of federally qualified health centers. Rebecca Kreitzer, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, recently told the Atlantic that oral contraceptives and condoms are cheap enough that community health clinics can afford to give them out and then request federal reimbursement, but IUDs and contraceptive implants -- two long-term but reversible methods -- are often too expensive for clinics to front without immediate payment. By contrast, Planned Parenthood is a big enough network that it can afford to provide more expensive methods immediately. Because of this, Planned Parenthood clinics are also likelier to have staff on hand with the requisite expertise. "Just because there is a federally qualified health center near where there is a Planned Parenthood Clinic does not mean we can assume the women going to Planned Parenthood would easily be served," said Keith J. Mueller, head of the Department of Health Management and Policy at the University of Iowa. When the Atlantic investigated how prepared Iowa health clinics were to pick up patients from Planned Parenthood, they found that lists of clinics provided by Republican lawmakers included "a dentist’s office, a school nurse, and a youth shelter" as well as one clinic that had closed and several that didn’t provide family-planning services. "They're assuming we're the alternative," Ted Boesen, CEO of the non-profit Iowa Primary Care Association, told the magazine. "But we're waiting to see what kind of a scale it is." Finally, the Energy and Commerce Committee said it’s possible to argue "that Planned Parenthood provides inferior overall service because they cannot offer holistic care to their patients, as they are a boutique reproductive health provider." But experts say the committee’s emphasis on full-spectrum health care is more expensive than reproductive health care "Because health centers must think about the full spectrum of primary health care for all patients, the absence of a specialized safety-net provider such as Planned Parenthood would be deeply problematic," Rosenbaum has written. "When health centers attempt to respond to a surge in demand, they must think about not just the specialized services lost, but all of the health needs of the patients who find their way to a health center, not to mention those of their families. … As a result, the anticipated cost per patient served is far higher than family planning and related services alone." In other words, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers is another reason why the increased federal funding figure in the bill may not be sufficient for replacing the lost Planned Parenthood services. Our ruling Loudermilk said that in the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics." Purely on the numbers, he has a point that there are more federally qualified health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics. But the notion that bypassing Planned Parenthood would mean "expanding" access is dubious. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers, even if they were provided with Planned Parenthood’s federal revenue stream, would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-15169	Says Scott Walker's plan to replace Obamacare "is a new entitlement" program for "every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/26/bobby-jindal/scott-walkers-obamacare-replacement-new-entitlemen/	The day Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his proposal to replace Obamacare, one of his rivals for the GOP presidential nomination jumped all over him. No, it wasn't Donald Trump. The attack came from Bobby Jindal, who has trailed Trump, Walker and other Republicans in presidential preference polls. In a nine-paragraph statement issued Aug. 18, 2015, the Louisiana governor called Walker's proposal an entitlement program -- seven times. A featured punch line: "In Governor Walker’s plan, a new entitlement is created for every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare." So, is Walker proposing what amounts to a new entitlement program -- and for every American human being? Setting the table Let's set out a couple of markers before we dig in. 1. Walker's 14-page proposal is essentially in outline form. It is a political document rather than a formal program. The Christian Science Monitor -- noting that health care expert Avik Roy estimated Walker’s proposal would cost about $1.1 trillion over 10 years -- observed that the plan "devotes only two sentences to outlining how this might be paid for." (Obamacare is expected to cost $1.2 trillion, according to a March 2015 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.) 2. There is some subjectivity in the term entitlement; it doesn't have a legal definition. At the same time, what constitutes an entitlement is well-established at the federal level. Defining entitlement A federal entitlement program gives benefits to everyone who qualifies -- without regard to how much, in total, the benefits will cost the government. That is, for most government programs, spending is limited to the amount that has been appropriated by Congress. But for entitlements, there is no predetermined limit -- the government spends whatever is necessary to provide the promised benefits to every eligible person who claims them. More formally, "A Glossary of Political Economy Terms" by Auburn University political scientist Paul Johnson, says an entitlement program "provides individuals with personal financial benefits to which an indefinite number of potential beneficiaries have a legal right whenever they meet eligibility conditions" specified by the law that authorizes the program. The glossary lists Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- as well as most Veterans' Administration programs, unemployment compensation and food stamps -- as being among the most important federal entitlements. Obamacare's entitlement Tax credits are one benefit offered under Obamacare. They are an entitlement, Harvard University economist and health care expert David Cutler told us. Anyone with moderate income who isn't eligible for coverage through an employer can get the subsidies, which are used toward the cost of buying insurance from the health insurance marketplace. The amounts vary depending on an individual's or family's income, as well as where they live. Place of residence helps take into account how the cost of coverage can vary by region. Walker's plan Walker’s proposal, called "The Day One Patient Freedom Plan," doesn’t use the word entitlement, of course. But Walker also would provide tax credits to people who do not have employer-based coverage, saying they would make health insurance more affordable and more portable. Those credits are what Jindal highlighted in his statement. Walker's credits differ from Obama's in that the amounts would be based only on age, not income or other factors. The plan says that, for example, a 35-year-old woman who makes $35,000 per year and has no children now gets nothing in Obamacare subsidies "because she’s too young and too middle class." But under Walker’s plan, she would get a $2,100 tax credit "that she could use to shop for insurance in the open market and put any savings into a health savings account." Several experts, from across the political spectrum, agreed that Walker's credits are an entitlement. Roy, in a blog post published in the conservative National Review the day after Walker's plan was released, used that word explicitly. "The core of Walker’s approach is a new, universal entitlement that every legal U.S. resident would be eligible for, regardless of income or need," wrote Roy, who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative New York think tank, and the opinion editor at Forbes. Economist Henry Aaron, a health care expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, D.C., told us that compared to Obamacare, Walker's plan would cost less and provide lesser benefits. But both sets of credits are are entitlements, he said. And Robert Kraig, executive director of the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin, said Walker’s program would be a broader entitlement than Obamacare because the tax credits would be available regardless of income to anyone up to age 65 who does not have employer-based health coverage. Still, Jindal's claim goes too far. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, agreed that Walker's tax credits are an entitlement. But he pointed out that they aren't necessarily new, since they're essentially the same, if smaller, than credits provided by the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, Jindal claims everyone would get Walker’s entitlement, when it would only apply to people who don’t get health insurance from their employer. Walker's campaign initially didn't address Jindal's claim, instead sending us articles in which conservatives praised the plan. But in a follow-up email, campaign spokeswoman Stacy Day said defining an entitlement as a financial benefit that everyone who qualifies for would get, without regard to the total cost of the government, is too broad. "Take a deduction approach, as some support," she wrote, "Under the definition you offered, any individual who qualifies for his health insurance deduction would receive the deduction without regard to the total cost to the government -- in this case, a reduction in the government's tax revenues. Moreover, there is no set appropriation for a deduction, the total amount spent would be determined by how many people are eligible for the deduction. Under this unreasonably broad definition of entitlement, all tax preferences would be entitlements. This is just not correct." That belies the example provided in Walker's own plan, where a person, regardless of income or other factors, would receive $2,100 in tax credits. As well as a consensus among the experts we spoke with that, like the Obamacare tax credits, Walker's credits are an entitlement. Our rating Jindal said Walker's plan to replace Obamacare "is a new entitlement" program for "every single American human being from the time they are born right up until they grow old and become eligible for Medicare." Walker’s proposal includes tax credits to help people buy coverage in the private market. The credits would be available to everyone up to age 65 -- without regard to income or other requirements -- but only if they don’t get health insurance from their employer. The credits aren't entirely new, however, as they are similar to those provided under Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-01438	"When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-deficit-fell-10-percent-gdp-3-pe/	During a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014, President Barack Obama offered a rosy -- if cautious -- view on the state of the economy. One of the statistics he touted was this one: "When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent." We wondered if he was correct. We looked at data from the Office of Management and Budget that tracks the federal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. Calculating it this way shows not the absolute level of the deficit but rather how big it is in relation to the size of the broader economy. The data shows that for fiscal year 2009, the deficit as a percentage of GDP was 9.8 percent, while the projected percentage for fiscal year 2014 is 3.7 percent. But the timing of the Office of Management and Budget figures don’t coincide with Obama taking office. The 9.8 percent figure covers fiscal year 2009 -- which runs from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 31, 2009. In other words, it covers a little less than four months of President George W. Bush’s second term, and nearly eight months of Obama’s first term. In other words, the figure looks at an entire year that covers two presidencies -- not a snapshot on the day Obama took office, Jan. 20, 2009. That casts some doubt about the accuracy of how Obama framed the issue. Obama said, "When I took office," which suggests that he inherited his predecessor’s deficit at nearly 10 percent of GDP and should get the credit for reducing it. The reality is that if Obama is going to claim some credit for reducing the deficit, he should also take some responsibility for pushing the deficit up to nearly 10 percent of GDP in his first fiscal year in office. Part of the reason the deficit was relatively high was because of the recession-fighting stimulus bill, which Obama championed. The deficit-to-GDP percentage for the fiscal year prior, 2008, was 3.1 percent. This gives a sense of what Obama inherited -- but it’s not a perfectly useful number, either, because it stops almost four months before Obama took office. During those four months, the economy was worsening rapidly, and spending on the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- which aimed to stabilize the financial sector -- had begun adding to the deficit. So if one could figure out a percentage for the day Obama was inaugurated -- which actually can’t be done -- it would likely be somewhere between 3.1 percent and 9.8 percent. There’s another wrinkle in comparing deficits to the economy overall and then trying to take credit for improvements. While it’s relatively easy to assign credit or blame for government spending, which helps shape the size of the country’s deficit, it is not nearly as easy to credit or blame Obama for the overall state of the economy as measured by GDP. "The impact of a president on the economy is tough to measure," said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. "So taking credit for a normalizing economy and the associated normalizing of the budget deficit is generally pushing it in my book." The transition from Bush to Obama is especially tough to parse, as these past PolitiFact articles show. The White House argued to PolitiFact that the deficit projected at the beginning of his first term, once you factor out the pricetag for the stimulus and related debt service, was 9.2 percent for fiscal year 2009. Looking at it this way has merit, but for a retrospective claim like this, we think it’s worth giving credence to hard numbers over initial projections. And we’d reiterate that some of the spending that took place before he was inaugurated, such as TARP, had the support of then-President-Elect Obama. "It would have been better for him to say, ‘In my first year in office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of GDP,’ " said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Our ruling Obama said, "When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy. Today, it's approaching 3 percent." Actually, the deficit reached 10 percent of the economy several months after Obama took office, not on his first day. Obama is laying the blame for the high deficit-to-GDP ratio entirely on Bush, when the figure covers time in office for both presidents. In reality, the numbers are more nuanced than he lets on, and his formulation oversimplifies the factors that played into these trends, some of which he had control over and some of which he didn’t. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-10-06T15:49:39	2014-10-02	['None']
pomt-00163	"Man dug tunnel from home to the pub and drank every night while his wife slept."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/23/blog-posting/no-irishman-did-not-dig-tunnel-his-home-his-pub/	How the Irish man saved his marriage: by digging a hole from under his home to a nearby pub to escape his snoring wife. That’s according to Men’s Corner, a website that claims to provide "a measured dose of humor" and "the latest information from all the fields which can be significant for the modern man." The article doesn’t have a date but the earliest comment is from Oct. 7, 2017, and it was recently revived on social media. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Man dug tunnel from home to the pub and drank every night while his wife slept," the headline says. The determined human excavator’s name is Patsy K., according to Men’s Corner. He is a plumber from Omagh, in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, who was inspired to build his own secret tunnel after watching the 1994 film, "The Shawshank Redemption." In that movie, an inmate played by actor Tim Robbins methodically burrows a tunnel out of the prison to find freedom. According to Men’s Corner, Patsy K. spent 15 years burrowing under his bed to his local bar 800 meters away. His stunt was discovered after he accidentally hit a sewage pipe, causing it to blow under his neighbor’s house. That’s when Patsy K. received a court summons, the story says. Using a form provided on Men’s Corner’s website under "Contact Us," we sent an email seeking more information about the story. Someone replied under the name "Tesanj Teslic," which are towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "Hi Ciara, I work for Men’s Corner," the person wrote. "This is an old post, the source we used no longer exists for some reason, so it can turn out that this story is not quite true. But you can check in the Omagh County Court (Northern Ireland) where this allegedly happened." A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunal Service Press Team said officials couldn’t search for current or disposed cases without the full name of the defendant, the court that they appeared and the time period when the case would’ve been heard. Other stories give the plumber’s full name as "Patsy Kerr," but it’s unclear what court may have heard his case. The Police Service of Northern Ireland responded to an email inquiry and asked for more details about the alleged plumber’s crime but did not immediately provide more information about this story. Variations of the story appear online, including on Tyrone Tribulations, a website that notes "accuracy cannot be guaranteed." Buzzfeed posted its own version in 2014, replete with a gif of Tim Robbins standing with his arms outstretched in the rain. "This man dug a tunnel to the pub using a spoon," the headline said.

pomt-15274	Since 2009, "we've cut homelessness (among veterans) by a third."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/28/barack-obama/obama-says-veteran-homelessness-has-been-cut-third/	Ever since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized the war record of Vietnam veteran Sen. John McCain on July 20, the treatment of veterans has been a major point of political discussion. President Barack Obama got into the fray in his July 21 interview with Jon Stewart on the Comedy Central program The Daily Show, during an unaired, exclusively online portion of the interview. Stewart questioned Obama on the state of veteran health care, citing, among other things, the VA’s long wait times. Obama defended the government agency, claiming the VA is structurally better than when he entered office, though it remains underfunded and its employees overworked. Later in the interview, he further defended his record when it comes to serving veterans. "Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third," Obama said. That one-third number struck us. Does Obama have the facts to back it up? One independent agency dedicated to fighting homelessness thinks so. On the "Veterans" page of the National Alliance to End Homelessness’ website, it reads, "In 2009, the Obama Administration committed to ending veteran homelessness in the U.S. by the end of 2015. Since 2010, there has been a 33 percent decrease in the number of homeless veterans." Nan Roman, the CEO and president of the Alliance, said the 33 percent decrease is backed by the yearly "point in time," called PIT, count of homeless veterans. Every year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) releases a detailed report about the state of homelessness in the United States to Congress, called the Annual Homeless Assessment Report. The 2014 report reported 49,933 homeless veterans according to the point in time count, a 32.57 percent decrease from the 2009 count of 74,050. The 2015 numbers are not yet available, but Roman said she expects further decreases. National "point in time" counts were first conducted in 2009, during the peak of the recession, so it is possible that the decline in homelessness among veterans has been symptomatic of the larger national economic recovery. But the count has been largely consistent since then. But what is a "point in time" count, and what do other metrics say about veteran homelessness? According to Dennis Culhane, a professor who studies homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, the PIT count is conducted around the same time every year by individual cities. The number is supposed to reflect the total number of homeless people, "sheltered" and "unsheltered," on a given night in a given city. Cities must do a count if they are to receive HUD funding. The "sheltered" count is easy. When homeless people stay in temporary, government-sponsored housing, they have to register with city officials. It’s the "unsheltered" population, the people living on the street, who pose a counting challenge According to Culhane, not every city counts the same way. Some literally count by hand the number of homeless people living on the street. Some estimate based on how likely it is to find a homeless person in a given area of a city. And some even change their counting methodology from year to year, forcing revised estimates that can change the national number. Despite some inevitable discrepancies, Roman said the PIT numbers are consistent. "They may be imperfect, but they’re imperfect in the same way every single year," Roman said. Further complicating things, it can be difficult to ascertain whether certain unsheltered homeless people are veterans. Sometimes, those who have served do not identify as such, or, on the flip side, people exaggerate their service. The PIT count also isn’t the only statistic for counting the homeless veteran population. Brian Sullivan, the supervisory public affairs specialist at HUD, pointed us to both the PIT number and the one-year estimate of sheltered veterans, a different metric. That number isn’t limited by the small time frame of the PIT count. It uses an entire year’s worth of data. The one-year estimate of sheltered veterans does not support the 33 percent number Obama offered. According to the most recent data, there were just 6.5 percent fewer homeless veterans from 2009 to 2013. But Roman and Culhane say the PIT number is preferred over the one-year estimate because the PIT takes into account both sheltered and unsheltered veterans. "I would use the PIT count. Annual data would be strong, if they included all veterans (i.e., unsheltered as well as sheltered)," Roman wrote in an email. "Over one-third of the homeless veteran population is unsheltered on a given night. That is a large percentage of the population to ignore." Culhane said the biggest drop in the homeless veteran population has been among the unsheltered, so ignoring that slice of the population would be counterintuitive. The only reason to be skeptical of the Annual Homeless Assessment Report numbers, Roman said, would be because they are pretty much the only numbers available. "It’s the administration reporting on the administration’s data, and we don’t have any verification of it," Roman said. Culhane, who helps with the count as the director of research for the VA’s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans, said there were multiple reasons to believe the numbers. For one, he pointed out, individual communities conduct the counts. For another, Obama and Congress together have thrown a lot of money at this problem in recent years. "In 2009, the federal budget for veteran homelessness was $400 million and that paid for a transitional housing program that was basically a fancy shelter," he said. "Now the budget is $1.5 billion." Roman agreed. "There’s a lot of work going on in communities to find every veteran, and there’s a lot of money being spent to get them into housing," she said. She pointed to the Supportive Services for Veterans Families and HUD-VA Supportive Housing programs, which have both cut down significantly on the cost of housing for homeless veterans. Our ruling Obama said, "Let’s take something like homelessness among veterans. So we’ve cut that by a third." According to the most recent, best available data, he’s right. During his tenure, homelessness among veterans has decreased 32.57 percent. However, that number is based on estimates that have an element of uncertainty. Also, funding to end homelessness among veterans has received bipartisan support in Congress. Still, Obama’s point is largely accurate, and we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08467	Delaware Democratic Senate candidate Chris Coons "thought that a 911 call should be taxed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/13/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-attacks-chris-coons-raising-tax/	Ever since she won the primary on Sept. 14, 2010, Christine O'Donnell, the surprise Republican nominee for a Senate seat from Delaware, has been the center of media attention -- from Real Time with Bill Maher to Saturday Night Live. An ad released on Oct. 11 paid for and authorized by Friends of Christine O'Donnell, seeks to turn the focus on her opponent, Democrat Chris Coons. In a minute-long ad featuring dark, horror-movie visuals and spooky music, O'Donnell portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware's populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs "The Taxman." Coons, the narrator intones, "is taxing everything out here." The ad makes several charges about Coons raising specific taxes. We'll take up one claim in another item -- that Coons proposed hiking property taxes by about 50 percent. This article will focus on a claim regarding taxes for 911 emergency service. Efforts to reach the O'Donnell campaign were unsuccessful. The ad phrases this claim in two slightly different ways. The narrator says that Coons "thought that a 911 call should be taxed." And as the narrator says that, the screen shows the text: "Proposed a 911 Cell Phone Fee." Before we critique the ad's accuracy, let's provide some background on the financing of 911 services, provided by Brian Fontes, the chief executive of the National Emergency Number Association, the group that represents 911 call centers and the vendors who service them. In theory, 911 services can simply be funded through a jurisdiction's general tax revenues, and in some places that is what's done. But more commonly, jurisdictions use either a tariff (that is, a levy approved by a telephone regulatory commission) or a fee (a levy often approved by an elected body such as a city council, a county council or a state legislature). Either way, the tariff or the fee appears as a line item on a customer's phone bill. Typically, users will see a standard amount assessed each month on any phone registered in a given jurisdiction. Fontes said that these levies tend not to be officially referred to as a "tax," but we think it's fair for O'Donnell to characterize it that way, since we expect most people wouldn't know what a 911 "tariff" is. As cell phones have become more common, they have overtaken land lines in the number of calls made to 911. That is especially true now because most cell phones can electronically route a call directly to the appropriate local 911 line, even if the phone is registered out of state. Nationally, Fontes said, cell phones make about 60 percent of 911 calls, and that percentage is growing by the year. In a 2007 story, Delaware's biggest newspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, quoted Dave Roberts, New Castle County's chief of emergency communications, saying that instead of getting "one or two calls on an incident on the turnpike, now we get 20 to 30 calls," he said. "When people see an emergency like that, they want to play their part." It's helpful, Roberts added, because some witnesses will have information that others missed, such as the color or model of a fleeing car. This has had an impact on how jurisdictions pay for 911 services. Since cell phones are a relatively recent invention, jurisdictions have had to write new laws or regulations to finance 911 calls through levies on cell phones, rather than just longstanding 911 fees on landlines. That's what happened in New Castle County in 2007. In early 2007, when Coons was assembling his county's budget proposal, he told the Wilmington News Journal in a March 17, 2007, article that "he plans to approach the General Assembly this spring for authority to create new revenue streams, such as a hotel tax, a 911 cell-phone fee and a paramedic-service fee." (Coons wouldn't have been able to implement the fee on his own -- it needed approval of the state legislature.) Later News Journal stories elaborated on the details. Coons wanted to increase the existing 911 excise tax on landlines from 60 cents a month to $1.00 and to impose, for the first time, a $1.00 monthly excise tax for 911 on cell phones. The newspaper quoted estimates that this could raise $3 million a year. The law passed in 2007. So where does O'Donnell's ad fit into this? The ad is correct that Coons proposed a tax to fund 911 services. But it adds some layers of obfuscation to this grain of truth. First, the ad is misleading when it implies that Coons strode into a tax-free oasis of 911 service and decided to impose a tax for the first time. Landlines had long been taxed to support 911 service. What Coons did was extend the tax to cell phones after their use to call 911 surged. Second, and probably more important, the ad is misleading about what exactly Coons proposed to do. The ad says that Chris Coons "thought that a 911 call should be taxed." We think most people would understand that to mean that every time they dialed 911, they would be hit by a tax. But that's not the case. Instead, Coons' proposed tax would have been a monthly levy on each user's bill, regardless of whether someone called 911 or not. No one needed to worry that calling 911 to help an injured motorist on the highway would lead to a special fee on their next phone bill. O'Donnell's ad twisted the details of a proposed 911 levy to fit her image of Coons as an insatiable tax monster. Yes, he proposed a tax, but for a service on which other phones already were being taxed. And Coons most certainly did not propose taxing individual 911 calls. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12544	"The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-obama-policies-blame-growth-m/	President Donald Trump blamed former President Barack Obama on Twitter for the formation of one of the most notorious gangs. "The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!" Trump tweeted April 18. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet came days after four young men were found brutally murdered in Central Islip in Long Island. The Suffolk County police commissioner said he suspects the MS-13 involvement. But the president’s post about the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 gang, is misleading. The gang was established in Los Angeles and spread across the country decades before Obama took office. Trump’s administration has conducted target operations to arrest criminals, but data is not yet available on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested or removed. Ioan Grillo, author of the 2016 book Gangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields, and the New Politics of Latin America, disputed Trump’s conclusion. "I have seen no evidence that the Obama administration can can be blamed in any way for the existence or activities of the gang in the U.S.," Grillo told PolitiFact. We asked a Trump spokesman for more information but did not hear back by deadline. MS-13 history and growth predates Obama policy Violent gangs, including MS-13, were forming in U.S. cities long before Obama’s presidency. MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. (The name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word "mara" which is a term for gang, "salva" for El Salvador and "trucha," which is slang for clever.) It later spread to other parts of the United States and in Central American nations. By the end of the 1990s, the United States government recognized that MS-13 posed a significant criminal threat. Amid an immigration crackdown toward the end of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the government launched an effort to deport foreign-born residents convicted of crimes, including gang members. In the mid 2000s, U.S. agencies including the FBI and ICE launched initiatives to combat the growth of gangs. There were several news reports about MS-13’s proliferation in the United States during the 2000s, with interest growing after a 2006 National Geographic documentary on the "World’s Most Dangerous Gang." The documentary showed that by the end of the 1990s, the gang had groups in almost every state. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed MS-13 on the same day as Trump’s tweet, blaming "an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement" for MS-13 recruitment. Multiple experts said there is no evidence that Obama policies caused the growth of Latino gangs in the United States. "The big surge was during Bush-Cheney when the drivers of illegal migration in Central America grew, when various crackdowns on crime-filled prisons to bursting point, and when funding for rehabilitation programs declined," said Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. Armstrong formerly worked as a national intelligence officer for Latin America, chief of staff of the CIA’s crime and narcotics center, and was a career CIA officer. The growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to draconian domestic policies in the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) that have pushed many gang members out of Central America, said Florida International University professor Jose Miguel Cruz. Héctor Silva Ávalos, a research fellow at American University, said that there has been a new peak in gang activities on the East Coast since 2014 -- especially in Long Island and Montgomery County, Md. "But this has to do with gang dynamics that have been brewing back in Central America since the Mauricio Funes administration in El Salvador (2009-14) brokered a truce with both MS-13 and Barrio 18," he said. "It is not related to U.S. internal policy." Elana Zilberg, a University of California San Diego communications professor, said Obama specifically targeted "criminal" aliens (including MS-13 members) in his aggressive deportation program. "However, Trump’s tweet might be a blunt allusion to Obama’s position on unaccompanied minors from Central America," she said. "That, however, was a policy inherited from the Bush administration." The number of Central American children coming alone began to increase in fiscal year 2012 and rose significantly in 2014. The Obama administration in 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address the issues driving their migration. The Central American Minors program allowed certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm could be admitted under parole. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. No data on MS-13 removals under Trump Trump lauded his administration’s enforcement efforts in a Fox News interview that aired shortly after his tweet. "We’ve gotten tremendous criminals out of this country," Trump said on Fox & Friends. "I'm talking about illegal immigrants that were here that caused tremendous crime that have murdered people, raped people, horrible things have happened. They are getting the hell out, or they are going to prison." Trump claimed nothing had been done to remove criminals until he came along. (Here is an overview of some targeted enforcement operations during the Obama administration that led to the arrests of criminals and gang members.) "It is a serious problem and we never did anything about it, and now we're doing something about it," Trump said. But ICE data available so far do not prove that Trump is removing MS-13 members "fast" as he tweeted. In February, the Trump administration said it had conducted targeted operations resulting in the arrest of more than 680 people, including gang members. At least one of them was a self-admitted MS-13 gang member from El Salvador. A unit within ICE tracks MS-13 arrests, but monthly data on gang and MS-13 arrests during Trump’s time in office is not available. From fiscal years 2005 through 2016, immigration officials made 7,051 MS-13 arrests, ICE said. ICE removal data shows how many individuals were suspected or confirmed gang members. But it does not say to which gang they were affiliated. In fiscal year 2016, ICE removed 240,255 individuals and 2,057 were suspected or confirmed gang members, the agency reported. During the full two months that Trump has been in office (February and March), a total of 36,467 individuals have been removed, according to an ICE official. ICE said it did not have information on how many of them were gang members. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com An executive order signed by Trump expanded removal priorities to include immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of crimes as well as those who have been charged with a criminal offense but not yet convicted. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!" MS-13 gangs in the United States were established decades before Obama took office and had been spreading across the U.S. long before his tenure. Experts told us there is no evidence Obama policies spurred their growth. Finally, Obama prioritized the deportation of criminal immigrants. Immigration officials told us data on how many MS-13 gang members have been arrested and removed under Trump’s administration is not available. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-12651	"South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing."	true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/23/habitat-humanity-broward/does-south-florida-lead-nation-gap-between-wages-a/	South Florida’s housing market spans the gamut of tony gated oceanfront mansions for millionaires and some downtrodden neighborhoods. That’s not unusual for a major urban area. But is it worse in South Florida than elsewhere in the nation? Habitat for Humanity painted a stark picture about the cost of housing in South Florida in a press release announcing that President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, retired Dr. Ben Carson, will visit the site of a future affordable housing development in Broward County on March 24. "Studies indicate that while Broward County is the most cost-burdened housing market in the nation, South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing," said the affordable home-building organization that partners with volunteers. We will focus on whether South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing. The phrase "cost-burdened" refers to households that spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. People who spend more than 50 percent are considered "severely cost-burdened." South Florida housing market Habitat for Humanity cited a few different reports about the lack of affordable housing in South Florida. A key report included information from the Center for Neighborhood Technology along with the Center for Housing Policy, a division of the National Housing Conference. The 2012 report outlined the struggle for moderate-income families to afford housing in the 25 largest metro areas. Researchers examined data between 2006-10 from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The report found that housing and transportation costs rose faster than income nationally, although the disparity was greater in some metro areas than others. And South Florida topped that list. In the Miami metro area, 40 percent of income for a moderate-income household was spent on housing, more than any other metro area in the study. (The Miami metropolitan statistical area was defined by the federal government at the time as stretching from Miami-Dade County, through Broward and north up to West Palm Beach.) It was followed by the Riverside, Calif., metro area and the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. More recent research shows that the Miami metro area continues to lag behind in affordable housing, said Janet Viveiros, acting director of research at the National Housing Conference. "Low- and moderate-income households, even those who are working, still face serious challenges in accessing affordable homeownership or renting in the Miami metro area," she said. The organization’s "Housing Landscape" report based on data from 2011-2014 found that 35.8 percent of low- and moderate-income working households in the Miami area spent more than half their income on housing. That was only exceeded -- slightly -- by the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif., area, which had 36.4 percent of those households spending that much on housing. (This report covered the 50 largest metro areas.) A study by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2015 found Miami had the largest share of cost-burdened renters of any major metro in the country. An NYU Furman Center/CapitalOne report in 2016 reached a similar conclusion. While metro areas with higher rents also had higher incomes, Miami "pops out as a troubling exception—a high-cost city without high incomes." Anne Ray, a researcher at the University of Florida’s Shimberg Center for Housing Studies, said that data continues to show that Miami housing costs are unattainable for low-income people. "Rent is very high and the median income is much lower, particularly in Miami-Dade, than other expensive markets," Ray said. Our ruling Habitat for Humanity says, "South Florida ranks No. 1 in the gap between wages and housing." Studies have repeatedly shown that South Florida tops the list in the gap between wages and housing. Although there are other metro areas with similarly expensive housing, wages lag behind in South Florida. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04394	Says Connie Mack takes two homestead exemptions, "directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/bill-nelson/mack-gets-one-florida/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV sparred over personal tax breaks during their only U.S. Senate debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. Mack cried moo early on during the Oct. 17, 2012, match, hitting Nelson for taking a greenbelt assessment on a family pasture because he allows a half-dozen cows to graze there. Nelson’s retort came a bit later, when a reporter-panelist asked if he supported amnesty for illegal immigrants. "I’m going to answer that in detail," Nelson said, "but I’m first going to say not only has it been a cow pasture for 60 years, (but) why don’t we ask him why he takes two homestead exemptions, which is directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution that says that a husband and wife can only take one homestead exemption?" Mack has faced heat over his homestead exemption since the primary, when former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux claimed he was a California resident who lives with his wife, U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. We rated that Mostly False. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin elaborated on Nelson’s comments after the debate, saying what Nelson meant is that "Mack is part of a family unit that has two homestead exemptions." He pointed to Florida’s Constitution, which says, "Not more than one exemption shall be allowed any individual or family unit or with respect to any residential unit." Some quick background: Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005; and two years later, he married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and U.S. Rep. Sonny Bono. When Mack announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that he had been criticized for not spending time in Florida. According to the story, "Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state." The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, but the courts have defined legal residence to mean a permanent residence, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections. Mack gets a homestead exemption for a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. His time at the home has been questioned by political opponents and also by his ex-wife, who said in a 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to "solely to assist his political career" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign has disputed her account. The Tampa Tribune raised more questions in February 2012, reporting that Mack’s current wife gets an exemption on her California home on top of Mack’s homestead break for his condo. The Tribune quoted William D. Shepherd, general counsel for the Hillsborough County property appraiser’s office, as saying the Macks should not collect two homestead exemptions because they are operating as a "family unit," and Florida law says one homestead exemption per unit. Under Florida law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife. Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: "They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers," James said. Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson looked into the legality of Mack’s homestead after the media attention about it. His verdict: "Connie is entitled to the homestead here." "He provided the documentation, and our attorneys looked at it, and it is proper," Wilkinson told PolitiFact Florida in an interview. Wilkinson said he could not get into specifics about Mack’s case, but he emphasized that Mack had to clear "very stringent hoops" to get the homestead after the review "or I would not have agreed." Further, he said he does not think the intent of homestead laws is to prevent members of Congress from getting married. If Connie Mack or Mary Bono Mack had to give up their homesteads, they may be at risk of losing the residency requirement for Congress. James said Nelson can’t back up his debate claim. "The Lee County assessor has approved Connie Mack's one and only homestead in Fort Myers, the only home he owns," James wrote in a statement after the debate. Shepherd said he still disagrees with Mack receiving the exemption. Shepherd told PolitiFact Florida that case law has changed on this even within the past year. "In Hillsborough, they would have to give up one of those homesteads," he said. Our ruling Nelson tried to whack accusations about his lower tax bill for a family pasture with a claim that Mack takes tax breaks of his own in the form of "two homestead exemptions." Mack and his wife both serve in Congress, representing two different states on opposite coasts, and that’s clearly an unusual situation. They each own their own homes in their respective states. While it’s true Mack and his wife have two homestead exemptions between them, it is not accurate for Nelson to say Mack himself has two homestead exemptions. That would not be lawful, and Mack’s county property appraiser has vetted his case and determined it proper. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-05118	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/27/michael-opitz/big-brother-spying-us-candidate-says-yes-and-blame/	A Republican primary candidate for Congress calls himself a friend of the tea party. The incumbent? A friend of Big Brother. Michael Opitz, a Cobb County Air Force veteran and activist, is one of two Republicans challenging U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey for his seat in Congress. One of his YouTube videos says the Republican congressman from Marietta is voting away your privacy rights. The nearly two-minute video is a slide show of surveillance imagery, including an illustration of the Statute of Liberty using binoculars and a still photo of the creepy antagonist from "The Matrix." The accusation is set to the Hall and Oates’ tune "Private Eyes." It appears in text: Gingrey "Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen. All YOUR Private Information Collected. Analyzed. Graphed. Categorized. STORED. Without a Warrant," it said. Are private eyes watching you? Do they see your every move? PolitiFact Georgia asked Opitz for more information on how Gingrey has given the government the power to "electronically spy on you, your family, the average U.S. citizen." The video touched on other issues, but since privacy was the ad’s main issue, we’ll focus our inquiry on this subject. Opitz pointed PolitiFact Georgia to the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, otherwise known as CISPA. CISPA, or H.R. 3523, gives private companies such as Internet service providers, telecommunication companies, commerce sites and social media networks permission to share certain information with the federal government without a warrant. In light of other changes in privacy laws and the development of new technologies that can catalog and track personal information, Opitz considers CISPA a big step down the road to tyranny. "This is George Orwell’s ‘1984’ on steroids," Opitz said. CISPA allows corporations to give intelligence agencies information on cyber and national security threats. The information can also be used to stop child exploitation and protect people from bodily harm. Gingrey co-sponsored CISPA, which passed the House on April 26. It has yet to clear the U.S. Senate. President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill. Gingrey campaign manager Jonathan Klein said the bill contains privacy protections. "Because of the dramatic rise in cyber attacks, this bill is designed to protect critical U.S. infrastructure, not ‘spy’ on unsuspecting families," Klein told PolitiFact Georgia in an email. We found Opitz’s claim had shortcomings. It’s premature to say that Gingrey "gave" the government more opportunities to look at consumers’ private information. CISPA is stalled in the Senate. In addition, the bill’s language specifies that it does not give the federal government the power to collect "all" of your private information, as Opitz said. But Opitz raises a valid point. Whether those restrictions will do enough to protect John Q. Public’s Google searches from being collected and cataloged is a hotly debated matter. CISPA lists types of information the federal government may not use, including firearm sales, book sales, tax returns and medical records. It also says that the feds may not save or use information for purposes other than what the bill describes. Paul Rosenzweig of the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation thinks Opitz’s claim is wrong. Allowing more information sharing is not the same as giving more power to the federal government, he said. Rosenzweig also pointed to language in the bill that says that information will be subject to "anonymization." Personal information would be stripped from the information that corporations hand over. "If you believe the government will completely go crazy, that’s a ‘Minority Report’ scenario that will never happen," Rosenzweig said. Still, opponents and supporters of CISPA agree that there is legitimate dispute over whether the privacy protections are tough enough. CISPA is written to protect corporations who opt to share information with the feds from lawsuits by consumers. This feature may make companies less scrupulous about withholding personal information such as your membership in an anti-abortion group or that you marched at an Occupy Wall Street rally. Opitz’s video makes a valid point, said Rainey Reitman, who directs advocacy against the bill for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "He does it dramatically, but it is a correct criticism," Reitman said. Under CISPA, corporations, not the consumer, decide what the government gets to see, said Michelle Richardson, an attorney who has been fighting the bill for the American Civil Liberties Union. "It does completely shift the presumption of privacy of the American citizen," Richardson said. Where does this leave Opitz? Opitz said that Gingrey "Gave Government the Power to Electronically Spy on YOU, YOUR FAMILY, the Average US Citizen." Opitz’s rhetoric is overheated, and a few of his facts need tweaking. CISPA hasn’t passed the Senate, so if the bill is designed to give the government additional powers, then it hasn’t done it yet. In addition, the bill contains language that supporters say will prevent government spying. But he does raise a legitimate criticism of CISPA. The bill’s protections may not be enough to keep average Americans safe from Hall and Oates’ private eyes. Opitz’s statement raises real issues. But he overstates some key points, and it could use a lot more context. Our rating: Mostly False.	None	Michael Opitz	None	None	None	2012-06-27T06:00:00	2012-05-29	['United_States']
pomt-04659	The Obama administration is allowing state waivers from welfare work requirements "only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/10/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-obama-administration-trying-boos/	Former President Bill Clinton used his elder statesman’s status in the Democratic Party to make the case for Barack Obama’s re-election, while touching on a subject paramount in his own legacy: welfare reform. In 1996 Clinton signed a landmark bill that transformed welfare from an indefinite entitlement to temporary assistance for poor Americans that required them to eventually join the workforce. Mitt Romney, in a campaign ad, has claimed that Obama gutted the work requirement. Clinton countered that in his Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Here’s what Clinton said really happened: "When some Republican governors asked if they could have waivers to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama administration listened because we all know it’s hard for even people with good work histories to get jobs today. So moving folks from welfare to work is a real challenge. "And the administration agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment. Now did I make myself clear? The requirement was for more work, not less." At PolitiFact, we have examined this welfare controversy before. Here, we’ll review the issue in light of Clinton’s new statement. The HHS memo Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually find a job. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce. A July 12, 2012, memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The memo outlined the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that "improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems" and "demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities," to give two examples. What does that mean? "If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures," is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.) The waivers, then, would inject some flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes. Sebelius’ letter HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reasserted the intent of the changes in a July 18 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "The proposal we have outlined strengthens the law’s purpose to move people off of welfare and into jobs by utilizing state-based innovation. Our goal is to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work, and no policy which undercuts that goal or waters down work requirements will be considered or approved by the Department," Sebelius wrote. She noted how, in 2005, several governors sought such flexibility in welfare and state waiver authority. That letter was signed by 29 Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Now, some states are again asking for flexibility, Sebelius wrote, naming Utah and Nevada, which both currently have Republican governors. She said some of the policies they requested would not meet the new HHS requirements. "The department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically, governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20 percent more people from welfare to work compared to the state’s past performance," Sebelius wrote. "States must also demonstrate clear progress toward that goal no later than one year after their programs take effect. If they fail, their waiver will be rescinded." Because no waivers have yet been approved, it’s difficult to say exactly what the changes would look like. The policy debate It’s important to note that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for activities that don’t count currently. Schott offered the hypothetical scenario that a state might change some requirements for specific subgroups, such as two-parent families, possibly by letting them stay in school longer. A waiver would let the state count those parents toward its work participation requirement. That is credit a state doesn’t get now and that could be counted toward a 20 percent improvement. That broader definition has some critics concerned. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow "state bureaucrats" to count activities that aren't really work. "In the past, state bureaucrats have attempted to define activities such as hula dancing, attending Weight Watchers, and bed rest as ‘work.’ These dodges were blocked by the federal work standards. Now that the Obama administration has abolished those standards, we can expect ‘work’ in the TANF program to mean anything but work," Rector argued. He also wrote, following Clinton’s speech, that the 20 percent increase Sebelius is demanding is a "meaningless measure" because in a typical state 1.5 percent of welfare recipients leave the program for work every month. To increase that by 20 percent would be a bump to only 1.8 percent of recipients gaining employment. "What will the other 98.2 percent of the caseload be doing? No one knows for sure. But one thing we do know for certain: They will be exempt from the federal ‘work participation’ requirements established in the welfare reform law," Rector wrote. Schott counters that the 20 percent improvement measure doesn’t exempt anyone from working. "Nothing about the waiver lifts the work requirement on any individual. The waiver is about the state’s performance measurement," she said. "The federal work participation requirement is something that states must meet. … Nobody is suggesting waiving that." Rector also contends that Sebelius is not legally authorized to issue waivers of existing work requirements. He argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions. "Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived," Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review. His argument on that point got an important affirmation this week when the Government Accountability Office said that Sebelius’ waiver proposal is "subject to the requirement that it be submitted to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before it can take effect." The Obama administration did not ask for Congress’ approval to grant waivers. Our ruling Clinton said in his convention speech that the Obama administration "agreed to give waivers to those governors and others only if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent, and they could keep the waivers only if they did increase employment." That's an accurate recap of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to strengthen welfare-to-work efforts by letting states try different approaches based on their residents’ needs. That’s important too -- the waivers would be considered for individually evaluated pilot programs. HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. The waiver offering was spurred by requests from several governors, including Republican governors, and Sebelius explicitly stated that only requests that "demonstrate clear progress" toward enhancing employment will be approved by HHS. Clinton’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-09-10T15:04:53	2012-09-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06332	"Governor Christie also remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/10/john-wisniewski/democratic-party-chairman-blasts-chris-christie-on/	The Democrats claim Gov. Chris Christie's coattails aren’t strong enough to sweep Republicans into power. That’s a departure from more than 50 years of history in New Jersey, a period where the party of every governor has seized control of at least one arm of the Legislature, according to the chairman of the state Democratic Party. Before voters went to the polls for Tuesday’s election, Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) released a memo on Monday, calling Christie "ineffective" for his inability to drum up enough support to send more Republicans to Trenton. "Governor Christie also remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term," Wisniewski said. "The last Governor who failed to have his party control at least one legislative body during his term was Governor Charles Edison, a Democrat, who served from 1941 to 1944." The election is over and the reins of the Legislature remain firmly in Democratic hands, as they have been since the Republican governor was first elected in November 2009. But is Christie the only governor whose party hasn’t taken control of at least one legislative house in more than five decades? PolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski’s statement is misleading. The Democrat is comparing a governor only midway through his first term with governors who served up to eight years in office. Wisniewski argued that his statement is accurate, because it’s based on the facts as they exist today. "I don’t understand why that would be an issue. That’s factually accurate," Wisniewski told us. "The facts speak for themselves." It’s true that since Edison left office in 1944, the party of the governor-elect or the incumbent governor has either gained control of at least one legislative body or maintained control of both houses. However, the party of two governors -- including Republican Gov. Tom Kean -- didn’t win control of any legislative body until the governor’s second term. Kean took office in 1982, when Democrats controlled both legislative houses. The GOP would not gain control of a legislative body until Kean won re-election in 1985, and Republicans secured the majority in the Assembly. Democratic Gov. Robert Meyner began his tenure in 1954 at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature. The GOP would maintain control throughout his first term and, when he won re-election in 1957, the Democrats took control of the Assembly. The cases of Kean and Meyner prove the same point: From when they were first elected to near the end of their second year in office -- the same point where Christie now stands -- Kean’s and Meyner’s parties had not won control of a legislative body. "The jury is still out on Chris Christie," said Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute. "It’s unfair to make that comparison yet since he’s not out of office." Republicans could still assume control of a legislative house during Christie’s tenure, but the new legislative map approved in April makes that scenario nearly impossible, Murray said. "The map favors everybody who’s already in office," Murray said. Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University, also said Wisniewski’s comparison is inaccurate. The best measure is comparing governors’ first mid-term elections, she said. "You can’t assess Governor Christie’s tenure when his term hasn’t yet been completed," Harrison said. There’s another problem with Wisniewski’s statement -- it ignores cases where a sitting governor’s party lost control of a legislative body. One of the most glaring examples of that dynamic occurred under former Democratic Gov. Jim Florio. When Florio was elected in 1989, the Democrats assumed majorities in both legislative houses. Two years later, the Democrats lost 31 seats as Republicans took control of the Legislature. Our ruling Wisniewski said in a memo that Christie "remains the only Governor since World War II, among both Democrats and Republicans, who failed to have his party win control of at least one legislative body over the course of his term." But that comparison is not valid. Christie has been in office for less than two years and we found two other governors since World War II whose parties had not won control of a legislative body at the same point in their terms. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07321	If the Sellwood Bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/may/14/charlotte-lehan/will-sellwood-bridge-have-be-shut-down-eight-years/	The Sellwood Bridge, opened in 1925, is the only crossing in a long stretch between the Interstate 205 and Ross Island bridges. It’s skinny and worn out and people have been talking forever about doing something about it. In the mid-1980s, the maximum vehicle load on the bridge was reduced to 32 tons. In June 2004, the county dropped the limit even further, to 10 tons, after discovering cracks. TriMet buses and heavier trucks have not been allowed since then. Last year, Clackamas County commissioners approved a $5 annual increase in motor vehicle registration fees to help pay for a new bridge. The issue is now before voters, some of whom argue it makes no sense to pitch in for a bridge owned by neighboring Multnomah County even if it is used by Clackamas County residents. Bridge supporters argue that if left alone, the Sellwood will have to be shut down soon. "Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years," wrote Clackamas County Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan. "This will lead to increased congestion and wait times on alternate routes including I-205, Highway 43 and McLoughlin Boulevard… Its complete closure would further hurt the hundreds of Clackamas County businesses and families who depend on it." Eight years. Yikes. That’s a pretty specific timeline and a pretty definitive statement. Obviously, we wanted to know where she got her figure. Tim Heider, spokesman for Clackamas County, said Lehan based her statement on a study provided by Multnomah County staff. The engineering study was conducted by David Evans and Associates in 2005 and had two purposes: to assess the condition of the Sellwood, and to find out what Multnomah County would need to do to keep the bridge in operation for another 10 to 15 years, at various weight limits, until a major rehabilitation or replacement could occur. The engineering group detailed how much money was needed to maintain different load limits. Multnomah County chose the least expensive option -- $1 million to inject epoxy into cracks and to monitor the situation. The load limit remained 10 tons. Simple math tells you that six years later, we have at most nine years remaining on the original 10- to15-year time frame. Mike Baker with David Evans said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that he found Lehan’s statement "consistent with conclusions reached by our firm." We at PolitiFact Oregon are not ones to quibble with engineers. They know a lot more about bridge mechanics than we do. But we still had questions. Did the county have any other evidence pointing to a bridge shutdown within eight years if it’s not replaced? Is replacement, and not repair, the only option for getting more life out of the bridge? And, significantly, what happens if Clackamas County voters vote down the vehicle registration fee on the May 17 ballot? After all, Lehan said what she said in the context of urging a yes vote on a fee increase. Multnomah County officials haven’t been very clear on what would happen if voters reject Measure 3-372. Clackamas is providing only $22 million of an estimated $290 million for a new bridge, but with funding already short $20 million, Multnomah County spokesman Mike Pullen said the county is not optimistic it could make up yet another $22 million. "We are working to replace the bridge, as you mention," Pullen wrote in an email. "But we cannot replace it if we can't pay for it. Without the $22 million from Clackamas County the project could be delayed, take longer to complete, or be partially completed." We also asked Pullen if the county had any other evidence indicating a bridge shutdown date. He spoke with the county's project manager and lead bridge engineer for the Sellwood Bridge, and reported this: "He said there is not a hard and fast date when we know we will need to close the bridge if it does not get repaired. But in the absence of that, the David Evans study is the best guide to how long the bridge can remain in service in its current condition," Pullen said. And finally, is replacement the only way to get more life out of the bridge? Pullen argued yes, because the county concluded it’s not cost-effective to do anything less. The spokesman could not entertain the possibility that more repairs or a lower weight limit might extend the life of the bridge, because in 2005 the engineering company’s "task was to tell us what it would take to keep the bridge in service ... for 10 to 15 years." We hate to say it, but all of this left us vaguely dissatisfied. Let’s return to Lehan’s statement: "Our time to act is limited -- if the bridge is not replaced, it will have to be shut down within eight years." She didn’t say, well, based on this study the bridge has about four to nine years left at the 10-ton limit, if nobody does anything about it in the meantime. She didn’t say that the study was in response to a specific question asked by Multnomah County. The bottom line is that PolitiFact Oregon can’t predict the future -- and neither can Charlotte Lehan. Her statement contains some element of truth -- there is a study, there is a time frame -- but it ignores the fact that officials would have to abandon long held plans and do nothing else in the interim for the Sellwood Bridge to "have to be shut down." We rate this statement Barely True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and rating. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlotte Lehan	None	None	None	2011-05-14T06:00:00	2011-03-29	['None']
pomt-08831	"The state budget has gone up over 80 percent under Rick Perry."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/12/bill-white/bill-white-says-state-budget-80-percent-under-rick/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White stopped in Midland on Monday, saying he'll be fiscally wiser as governor than the Republican incumbent. "I know how to squeeze value out of taxpayers' dollars," White told Midland's KWES-TV, Channel 9. "The state budget has gone up over 80 percent under Rick Perry. That's just too much. We're not getting the value out of those dollars that we need to get out." Over 80 percent? That percentage sounded familiar. In a February Truth-O-Meter article, we reported that budgeted non-dedicated state spending increased 80 percent from the 2000-01 budget, adopted the year before Perry became governor, to the current budget. We found shaky Perry's statement that on his watch, "we cut state spending." After asking White's campaign for backup on his "over 80 percent" statement, we revisited the budget numbers -- and realized an error of our own. We were correct in February that budgeted non-dedicated spending has increased about $25 billion during Perry's decade-plus as governor. Indeed, such spending increased from $55.7 billion in 2000-01 to nearly $80.6 billion in 2010-11, according to the "Fiscal Size-up" for 2010-11 published by the Legislative Budget Board. However, we miscalculated the percentage increase, which was 45 percent -- not the 80 percent we reported. And how did White reach his proclaimed increase of over 80 percent? The entire budget, counting all funding sources including federal and local aid, increased from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11-- a boost of 79 percent. (Please free free to check our math; we thank you.) We ran the 79 percent bump by Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. He suggested any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latest budget that weren't at play in 2000-01. First, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that's costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn't translate to an increase in government spending; it's a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the latest budget includes about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Take the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent. The budget board offers another way of weighing changes in spending by adjusting raw budget numbers for changes in population and inflation. At our request, the board created a chart enabling us to compare the adjusted numbers for the 2000-01 budget against the 2010-11 version. Counting all funding sources, during Perry's gubernatorial years the state budget adjusted for changes in population and inflation has increased 18 percent. So, where does this leave White's statement? White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in a Tuesday e-mail that White should have said "about 80 percent" in the Midland interview instead of "over 80 percent." Bacon's e-mail also notes expectations the 2011 Legislature will confront an $18 billion revenue shortfall, which Bacon calls a deficit. Given that, her e-mail says, "Bill will have to make cuts. He is very good at this and has often discussed his approach to making cuts and finding efficiencies. He has said he needs to 'get under the hood' and also work with legislators on specific cuts." Upshot: Budgeted spending increased nearly 79 percent on Perry's watch, not the "over 80 percent" White said. Also, there are ways to analyze the increase that reduce the growth percentage. Still, it's defensible to lean on raw budget amounts. We rate White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-08-12T06:00:00	2010-08-09	['None']
pomt-07163	"We already have $23 billion worth of debt."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/13/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-state-debt-23-billion/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a record $615 million from the 2011-12 state budget on May 26, 2011, targeting an array of money for projects such as university buildings, a rainwater study and $4.8 million for public broadcasting. The latter cut caused station managers across the state to worry about possible layoffs, station closings and an increased reliance on private donations. In a June 2 interview, ABC 27 reporter Jerry Hume in Tallahassee asked Scott if vetoing public broadcasting dollars was a hard choice compared to other line items. Here is Scott's full response (available by video): "I don't think the state ought to be paying for that. But the easy ones are things like studying how to collect rainwater, stuff like that, and a new barn and things like that. But there's a lot of tough ones. But the way I thought about it was, what should state government be doing? I mean, there's a lot of good things in there, but they were local issues, or charity should be doing it, or there's a better way of doing it, or we're already doing it a different way. "And on top of that, I don't want to increase the debt in the state. We already have $23 billion worth of debt, so those are things I thought about. But really, it was how do we get jobs going?" Scott mentions the state debt as support for his big cuts, even though the state wasn't going to issue new debt just for public broadcasting. But it got us thinking: How big is the state debt, anyway? Turns out, this isn't the first time Scott has bemoaned the state's debt. In late May, Scott warned he was thinking about vetoing Public Education Capital Outlay projects, which pay for college and university construction projects and represent the state's largest bond program. He said the added debt of $134 million could jeopardize the state's credit rating and increase costs of future borrowing. "I'm clearly focused on the amount of debt the state has," Scott said then. "I'm clearly focused on the debt rating." Where does he get that number? Our search for the state debt level starts with Scott spokesman Lane Wright. He directed us to a December 2010 report on Florida's debt affordability, written by the State Board of Administration's Division of Bond Finance. The division is responsible for executing bonds authorized by the Legislature and administers financing programs for educational facilities and transportation projects, among other programs. As of June 30, 2010, the state's total overall debt outstanding stood at $28.2 billion. Now, this doesn't mean Scott's figure is off from the get-go. That $28.2 billion figure includes $23.6 billion for "net tax-supported debt" and $4.6 billion for "self-supporting debt." These are important differences to understand (page 7 of the document is helpful). Net tax-supported debt, which Scott seems to reference in his TV interview, is debt accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending on projects such as PECO, Everglades restoration, right-of-way acquisition for roads and bridge construction. Self-supporting debt is made up of bonds that include a source of revenue, and is excluded when calculating the state's benchmark debt ratio. Examples of this are bonds to build toll roads, covered by the tolls, or university dorm maintenance, covered by student fees. Net tax-supported debt is paid off through the state's ability to tax all residents and tourists, while self-supporting debt is paid off by the people who pay to use the facilities. The benchmark debt ratio is important SBA jargon for measuring the state's annual payment on borrowed money, said Ben Watkins, the division's director. The annual payment, called debt service, works kind of like a mortgage, in which you pay off a chunk each year over a certain span of years. Debt service is based on tax-supported debt. To calculate the benchmark debt ratio, the division divides the annual debt service -- for tax-supported debt only -- by available state revenues. Florida Statutes say the ratio should not exceed a target of 6 percent and a cap of 7 percent. But in 2010, it was over the cap at 7.91 percent. That did not happen as a result of outstanding debt, Watkins said, but declining state revenues (the denominator of the benchmark ratio equation). The Legislature authorized more borrowing in 2010 due to a "critical state emergency," pursuant to state law. The law on benchmark debt ratios is really a "soft" policy limit to give lawmakers perspective on how much debt the state can afford, Watkins said. The cap is seen as a planning tool and not an absolute ceiling, though other states have "hard limits." Still, exceeding the "soft cap" should signal the state has borrowed all it should, and more borrowing should happen for absolutely essential projects, Watkins said. Anyway, Florida pays about $2.1 billion a year for debt service on the state's tax-supported debt. There's another type of debt to consider, called indirect debt. Unlike tax-supported and self-supported debt, this category does not get as much attention because the debt obligation lies with a separate legal entity such as Citizens Property Insurance, Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Finance Corporation, water management districts or the Florida Housing Finance Corporation -- not the state. As of June 30, 2010, the indirect debt total was $16.4 billion. It is a whopping figure, but it is not included in the state's debt ratios or debt burden, according to the report. We mention all of this to explain that Scott is essentially short-handing the state's debt by describing it as $23 billion. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. "This is the debt (figure) that matters to the state from a financial management perspective," Watkins said. Putting Florida debt in context Now that we've considered the 2010 financial report, we looked for another opinion to make sure we understood all the context. Florida TaxWatch, a group that analyzes state spending and taxes, uses the same data supplied by the Division of Bond Finance to track the debt. Kurt Wenner, TaxWatch vice president of tax research, echoed much of Watkins' analysis and agreed that $23 billion is probably the most accurate figure to use to describe the state debt. "That is the amount of debt that is backed by Florida taxpayers," Wenner said. Florida's debt doesn't get as many people talking as the country's $14 trillion-plus national debt. One explanation is that Florida has a balanced budget requirement, Wenner said. So it cannot "spend money it simply doesn't have, like Washington does." Florida's borrowed money goes toward "bricks and sticks" projects, Watkins said, and not for normal government operations. Florida's total outstanding debt last year grew $1.8 billion, exceeding the $1 billion average for the past decade, according to the report. Still, the debt is considered "moderate" and "manageable" at its current level. Our ruling Scott said he thought about the state's $23 billion debt as he weighed whether to veto certain programs. We verified that figure with the Division of Bond Finance's most recent estimate, and experts consider the figure a street convention to describe the debt. We rate his claim True.

pomt-13693	"We fixed a loophole in the (gun) background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-says-while-governor-state-clos/	Tim Kaine says he steered Virginia through some dark days as governor, but none was worse than April 16, 2007. That was the day a gunman murdered 32 students and faculty members at Virginia Tech before he took his own life. In the aftermath, Kaine says he turned his attention to Virginia’s gun laws. "We fixed a loophole in the background record-check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer," Kaine told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday while accepting his party’s nomination for vice president. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, backed Kaine’s statement by pointing to several articles about an executive order Kaine issued shortly after the shootings. The order expanded the court records that are shared with law enforcement officials to ensure that mentally ill people who are deemed dangerous can’t buy firearms from licensed gun dealers. Federal law bars people who have been adjudicated "mentally defective" from purchasing firearms. But the Virginia Tech gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, cleared background checks in early 2007 to buy the two semiautomatic pistols he used in the massacre despite having been found by a judge to be a danger to himself in December 2005. Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient care, but that record wasn’t shared with Virginia law enforcement officials, according to a state report on the shootings that was issued in 2009. As a result, Cho’s history wasn’t entered in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and he was cleared to buy the firearms. Virginia’s laws were unclear about whether Cho’s mental health records were required to be sent to the state police so that they could be entered into national background check files. The issue centered around the fact that Cho had been ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment instead of being sent to an inpatient facility. While state law was clear that anyone admitted to an inpatient care facility couldn’t buy a gun, the law was ambiguous on whether someone ordered to undergo outpatient care was barred from buying a weapon, according to the 2009 state report examining the shootings. Kaine issued his executive order on April 30, 2007, two weeks after the Tech shootings. He mandated that state agencies collect information about people who are required to undergo mental health treatment "whether on an inpatient or outpatient basis" and send those records to state and federal databases to ensure they can’t buy a gun. Even with Kaine’s order, gaps remained. The Washington Post noted in an article that Kaine’s executive order wasn’t retroactive, meaning it only covered court orders made after its April 2007 enactment. Also, it didn’t address a loophole in state law that allows people to buy guns from unlicensed sellers without undergoing a background check. An unlicensed seller is someone who is not in the business of dealing firearms, such as a citizen seeking to sell a gun he keeps in his house. In 2008, the General Assembly passed a bill that enshrined Kaine’s executive order on mental health records into law. But Kaine failed in an effort to go one step further and close the loophole that allows private sales of guns without a background check. Our ruling Kaine said that while governor, "We fixed a loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer." Kaine can legitimately take credit for plugging a gap in state law that allowed some mentally ill people to buy guns even after having been ordered by courts to get outpatient treatment. So we rate his claim True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-29T14:29:36	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-10490	"I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/hillary-clinton/very-well-in-mass-and-calif/	Citing a mock election that Sen. Barack Obama won, a reporter for a student newspaper asked Sen. Hillary Clinton why her numbers aren't as strong with young voters. "Well, I think they're getting better," Clinton said at the March 25, 2008, news conference in Greensburg, Pa. "You know, I was very pleased at the reception that I've gotten here in Pennsylvania. And, you know, I did very well with young people in Ohio, Massachusetts, California." Clinton uses three big states whose primaries she won to prove her popularity with young people. Exit polls from those states show she competed well with Obama for voters under 30 years old in two of the three states: • In California, she and Obama tied at 49 percent each. • In Massachusetts, she won 49 percent. Obama won 48 percent. • In Ohio, Clinton won 35 percent. Obama won 61 percent. Clinton did better among the youngest voters — those under 25 — in California and Massachusetts, but fared worse in Ohio: • In California, Clinton won 50 percent to Obama's 48 percent. • In Massachusetts, she won 57 percent while Obama took 39 percent. • In Ohio, Clinton won 29 percent compared to Obama's 70 percent. Joe Lenski of Edison Media Research, the company that conducts the exit polls, said the sample sizes for the voters under 25 in the three states were only about 100 people each — too few to produce meaningful results. "I wouldn't say (she did well) with that number because the sample size is too low," said Lenski, who is the executive vice president. "But I'm a survey researcher, not a politician." The figures for voters under 30 are more reliable, he said, and agreed with Clinton's claim that she did well with young voters in Massachusetts and California, where she split the vote with Obama. Considering Clinton usually trails Obama by about 20 points among young voters, a tie is pretty good, Lenski said. Exit poll patterns show her performing best among older voters, he added. Lenski noted that Clinton won even more youth votes in Oklahoma and Arkansas — 60 percent and 56 percent under 30, respectively, he said — but may have passed over those examples because they're not big, core Democratic states like California and Massachusetts. It has been a bit of conventional wisdom in this campaign that Obama is winning the youth vote, which is why we evaluated Clinton's claim of doing "very well" in that context. As Lenski said, splitting the under-30 vote with Obama in Massachusetts and California is a good record for Clinton, and we find that part of her claim to be true. But by including Ohio in her claim, where Clinton took less than half of the under-30 vote that Obama won, she has gone way too far, leading us to conclude that her overall claim to doing "very well" among young voters is Half True.

pomt-09180	Charlie Crist "bizarrely vetoed" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida "despite having previously argued the budget request had merit."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/04/marco-rubio/rubio-says-crist-vetoed-his-own-item/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio wants voters to see his independent opponent Gov. Charlie Crist as a repeat flip-flopper who vetoed a project out of political spite. In one of Rubio's most recent claims, posted to his campaign website June 2, 2010, he says that Crist "bizarrely vetoed" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida "despite having previously argued the budget request had merit." Here is what Rubio wrote: "For his latest astounding flip-flop, Charlie Crist on Friday vetoed nearly $9.7 million in state funding for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida despite having included the funding as part of his budget recommendation in January. As part of his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2010-2011, Charlie Crist’s office even wrote a justification for the budget request that can be read HERE. Yet, Crist bizarrely vetoed the funding despite having previously argued that the budget request had merit. Was this political payback for Republican leaders no longer supporting him? Is there anything else that could explain a seemingly inexplicable flip-flop?" There is no dispute that Crist vetoed $9,673,569 for Shands teaching hospital -- line item 185. The veto on May 28 was one of about $371 million in budget vetoes. So the only question is if he had "previously argued the budget request had merit." Some background: Shands at UF is a teaching hospital in Gainesville that serves many uninsured patients and draws patients from throughout the state. In the last fiscal year, Shands UF provided about $49 million in unreimbursed financial assistance. But Crist's veto could cost the hospital at least $12 million in matching federal funds, according to a June 2 article in the Gainesville Sun. Now, some political context leading up to Crist's veto. Crist included $9,673,569 for Shands in his recommended budget that was released in January. When he proposed his budget, Crist -- a Republican at the time -- was in a battle for the Republican Senate primary with former House Speaker Rubio. During the spring legislative session, his relationship with some Republicans soured over disagreements about abortion, teacher tenure and other issues. He found himself lagging behind Rubio in the polls and announced April 29 that he would ditch the GOP and run as an independent. So that means Crist was an independent by veto day. Rubio provides links to Crist's budget request for the hospital funding. It includes the appropriation bill showing the money for Shands hospital. Shands officials were surprised by the veto. "We had no idea this was coming," Shands spokeswoman Kim Rose said in a June 3 interview. "We had not been asked any questions about it. This appropriation was included in his last three budgets and he had recommended it for this one." A May 29 press release from Shands stated: "This line item in the governor’s budget has been in place for three decades and historically has been funded through a recurring general revenue allocation. As one of the state’s largest charity care providers, these state funds were the only source available for Shands at UF to be eligible for additional federal funds since it is not part of a local taxing district." A May 30 article in the Gainesville Sun, one day after Crist's veto, quoted from a memo written by Shands HealthCare CEO Tim Goldfarb. "Goldfarb said in the memo that the veto was unexpected because Crist had recommended the funding as part of the budget and approved it in his previous three proposed budget plans,'' stated the article. "Goldfarb added the total impact could be even greater because the state cut could lead to a reduction in federal money." The Florida Times-Union had a direct link to Goldfarb's memo. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey told Health News Florida and the Gainesville Sun that the governor vetoed the money because it was targeted at a single hospital and no other hospitals received the same type of additional funding. Crist wrote in his May 28 veto message that his budget would protect the most vulnerable -- though he vetoed money for Shands, a hospital that serves many poor patients. "While economic recovery is on the horizon, General Revenue dollars are still scarce and spending has to be carefully prioritized to provide the most critical services to the citizens of our state," Crist wrote. The governor defended his veto, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times June 4 article: “The concern was more with the process of it, to be honest with you. And the lateness of it. I didn’t want things that came late and didn’t have the complete committee vetting opportunity.” Crist denied that his veto was political: “It’s motivated by being an appropriate process (and) the economic reality that we’re living in.” Michelle Todd, a spokesperson for Crist's campaign, replied to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail: "The majority of the budget provides funding for essential state services, protects our most vulnerable, keeps our citizens safe and provides for education of our children. As stipulated in the Governor's budget signing letter on May 28, 2010, he directed staff '...to provide a thorough review of each item in the budget. Through this process we have identified projects in the budget that were inserted late in the process; funded outside of established processes; and earmarked funds benefiting a select group or geographic region.' The Shands Teaching Hospital line item falls into this last category and is the only Teaching Hospital in the state receiving a distinct general revenue recurring line item in the General Appropriations Act. While it is true that this item was contained in previous Governor's Recommended Budgets, the current economy and outlook for the near future dictated a thorough review of all projects." It's clear that Crist vetoed $9.7 million for Shands, though it had previously been in his budget. His campaign argues that Florida's weak economy led to the veto decision. We rate Rubio's claim as True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-06-04T14:27:18	2010-06-02	['Charlie_Crist', 'University_of_Florida']
pomt-12303	Says investigators have found remains of missing women in steel barrels buried on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s property.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/26/freedomcrossroadsus/saga-bodies-found-barrels-clinton-property-fake-ne/	A series of posts that say more than a dozen sets of human remains have been found on Bill and Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, N.Y., property are fake news. "Breaking: Barrels removed from Clinton property contained parts from 3 missing women," read the headline on a June 20, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us. Facebook users flagged that post and others related to it as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. The June 20 article said that investigators had unearthed a 55-gallon steel drum from the Clintons’ yard. The barrel contained the remains of three women who went missing in Arkansas in 1974, the story said. There was no date or context on the post, but it did note that "the barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a ‘crude preservative.’ " The story is fake, as are subsequent stories about the same investigation that followed the June 20 post. There is no corroborating evidence any of this happened. The photo used with the story is from 2012, when a man and a woman were found in a barrel in a South Carolina lake. FreedomCrossroads.us posted more stories about the fake Clinton storyline over subsequent days. One story added to the site on June 21 said 11 more drums were found on the grounds, while "the Clintons sat rocking in their chairs on the front porch sipping coffee or tea while the home they’ve lived in more than 15 years was exposed as a graveyard." By June 23, the website was declaring Bill Clinton even went to high school with two of the victims, but neither Clinton would be facing any charges over the 14 sets of remains, for lack of evidence (and bribing the FBI). These stories have spread online, showing up on other websites, but they still aren’t real. FreedomCrossroads.us said on its page footer that the site fabricates its content. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate," it reads. The site featured a similar page design to TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet. That site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He told us in the past that his aim was to trick conservatives with fake news stories that exposed how gullible they were. A Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair, and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him (although the email address has changed since we first checked the site). The site was registered on Aug. 18, 2016. We have tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site’s owner but didn’t get any response. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

Amid criticism of the funding package for Foxconn Technology Group, the Eau Claire Democrat dropped a brief reference to new businesses activity in the state: "We are last in the nation in startups — 50th," Wachs said in the Jan. 29, 2018, appearance on "The Devil’s Advocates" show in Madison. "You can’t get any worse." Are 49 other states really ranked higher on startups than Wisconsin? Let’s ask the experts. Study supports startup claim Startup research is a niche field that experts say is only addressed in detail by one group — the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Olivia Hwang, a spokeswoman for Wachs’ campaign, said that is the research the candidate was referring to in the radio appearance. The foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations, has put out an annual report for years ranking each state’s "startup activity." It’s a customized metric that combines number of startup firms per capita, percentage of the adult population that become business owners in a given month and percentage of new entrepreneurs starting businesses because they saw market opportunity (i.e. that weren’t previously unemployed). Their latest study, released in May 2017, ranked Wisconsin dead last for the third straight year. Nevada, Oklahoma, Wyoming, California and Texas topped the list, while New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Alabama joined Wisconsin at the bottom. We should note other measures of Wisconsin’s business climate place Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack, as we noted in a 2017 fact check on Gov. Scott Walker’s claim that Wisconsin was a "Top 10" state for business. Wisconsin is 15th among all states in business survivability, with 51% of businesses remaining in operation at least five years. And Kauffman rated Wisconsin second in the nation for Main Street Entrepreneurship, another combined metric that looks at the survival rate and the per capita number of businesses and business owners. Wachs, a member of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board, is one of 16 Democrats vying for a spot on the November general election ballot opposite Walker. Major opponents include state schools Superintendent Tony Evers; Milwaukee businessman Andy Gronik; state firefighter union President Mahlon Mitchell; Sen. Kathleen Vinehout of Alma; former state Democratic Party Chairman Matthew Flynn; Madison Mayor Paul Soglin; former state Rep. Kelda Roys; and political activist Mike McCabe. Our ruling Wachs said Wisconsin is last in the nation in startups. The go-to national research on the subject shows Wisconsin is indeed last — and has been for the last three years. We rate Wachs’ claim True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dana Wachs	None	None	None	2018-03-08T06:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']
pomt-03442	Says TriMet spends "$10.3 million in police contracts" a year for 56 transit police who must respond to non-transit calls	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/22/amalgamated-transit-union/does-trimet-spend-10-million-year-transit-police-r/	The Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 757, took to newspaper outlets this month, berating TriMet for causing its own financial troubles. The union represents bus drivers, mechanics and support staff for the Portland-area’s public transit system. The two sides are in contract negotiations. The union’s large-size ad, which appeared in The Oregonian and other publications, takes aim at TriMet for what union leaders describe as squandered spending. For example, the ad says TriMet spends $10.3 million a year for transit police who are rarely around. "We love our transit police officers. They are competent and caring. But we seldom see them. This is because they must respond to non-transit calls. When we ask what these 56 officers do for $10 million per year, TriMet’s response is that it doesn’t audit performance under the contracts," reads the ad, titled "TriMet Financial Problems: Self-Inflicted?" We haven’t the faintest idea who handles security on MAX and buses, or how duties are allocated. So we were game to check it out. Does TriMet pay $10 million a year for 56 transit officers who respond to non-transit calls and aren’t around much? TriMet’s public affairs department says the assertions are inaccurate. It issued a point-by-point rebukethat you can read on its website. The transit agency says that the Transit Police Division has 62 sworn law enforcement officers on contract, led by a Portland Police commander. In 2011-12, TriMet budgeted $8.64 million -- of which $8.15 million was spent on salaries, benefits, insurance and vehicles. While waiting for Bruce Hansen, union president, to return our calls and emails, we decided to take a look-see into the TriMet budget adopted for 2013-14. Because we’re not really sure why TriMet cites 2011-12 numbers in response to a claim made in June 2013. We scrolled through the budget and found on page SS-5, $10.2 million for police security contracts. A follow-up conversation with TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch illuminated that the security contract costs are even higher -- there’s just over $500,000 for the canine unit -- for a total of $10.7 million. So, the transit union appears to be pretty spot on with the dollar amount. TriMet says the number of officers is 62, not 56, as stated in the ads. Hansen said that they relied on information received from TriMet through public records requests. He’s not sure why TriMet is using 2011-12 figures either. TriMet says that’s what the union requested. We’ll leave that alone. Now, what about the union’s assertion that transit police have to respond to non-transit calls? TriMet has policing contracts with 17 law enforcement agencies in the region. Each agency contributes a set number of officers who make up the Transit Police Division. The number may change based on officer availability, but Portland Police provides the largest number of officers. Transit police is a contracted service, but it’s not unlike other police divisions. Officers apply for a post. They serve multi-year terms. Members are expected to patrol vehicles and stations and enforce TriMet ordinances, such as not smoking at shelters and at MAX platforms. The union suggests that the public is not getting enough value for the amount of money spent on transit police. We have no idea if that’s a fair accusation, although TriMet says transit police spend at least 70 percent of their contracted time on transit related matters. TriMet has been much in the news. The Oregonian has reported on sleepy drivers behind the wheel, sneakily distributed pay raises for executives and managers and historic fare increases and service cutbacks. In other words, we’re sure TriMet has way more problems to worry about than a mere $10 million transit police contract, out of a $485 million operating budget for Fiscal Year 2014, which starts July 1. Let’s go to the ruling. The agency has budgeted $10.2 million for police contracts. The budgeted amount is $10.7 million if you include the canine program. We think those numbers are pretty close to the $10.3 million cited by the union. The number of officers is 62 according to TriMet, which again, we don’t see as being that significantly different from 56. Are transit police seldom seen? That’s not something we can rule on. We suppose that is in the eye of the beholder. Must transit police respond to non-transit related calls? Yes, that’s because they are sworn officers who must respond to whatever calls roll in, just like any law enforcement officer on the job. The statement is accurate but needs clarification as to number of officers and why they’re not dedicated solely to TriMet. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07913	Says the United States does not "trade as much as other developed nations."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/01/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-trade-lags-behind-other-de/	When a former United States trade ambassador wins a seat in the U.S. Senate, it’s a sure bet he’ll advance his pro-trade views when talking with constituents. So Rob Portman, the freshman Republican senator from Ohio, surprised no one when he told the Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 20 that the United States "should be aggressively promoting the reduction of barriers overseas to U.S. products." But Portman, a trade ambassador under President George W. Bush, added this nugget, according to coverage in the Toledo Blade: "We don’t trade as much as other developed countries." That latter statement struck us as curious since the United States appears to export a massive amount of goods and services -- $1.8 trillion worth in 2008, according to Commerce Department data. Measured in absolute terms, few countries can match the United States when it comes to products shipped abroad, according to the World Trade Organization and the CIA World Factbook, both of which put United States exports of merchandise, the broadest category, behind only Germany and China. But Portman’s communications director, Jeffrey Sadosky, told us that when Portman was comparing United States trade with that of other countries, he was measuring the value of exports as they relate to each country’s overall economy. Sadosky pointed us to the World Bank, which tracks the value of exports from all countries and rates them as a measure of gross domestic product, or each country’s output of goods and services. By that measure, the United States is a slacker. World Bank data that we reviewed independently showed the United States to be near rock bottom: This country’s exports represented 13 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, equal to Haiti and barely better than Nepal and Tonga (12 percent) and Ethiopia (11 percent). We chose 2008, as did Portman, because it represented a year before economies were declining rapidly. To make this easier to understand, consider this analogy about crime. A big city is likely to have more crimes than a small one, so in absolute numbers, the big city will seem a lot more crime-ridden. But if you compare the number of crimes against the number of people living in a small city, you get the crime rate, which can more accurately reflect the safety of a community. Comparing trade numbers can yield the same kind of distortion. Looking just at absolute numbers, a large country like the United States can appear to be in the top tier of exporting nations. But if you compare exports to the GDP, you get a much different picture. Here’s how some other nations compare with the U.S. export-to-GDP ratio of 13 percent: Japan, 18 percent Australia, 20 percent. France, 27 percent Russian Federation, 31 percent Canada, 35 percent China, 35 percent Germany, 47 percent Economists say there are logical reasons for this disparity. The United States is rich with resources and largely self-sufficient. It borders only two other countries, whereas cross-border trade in Europe grew out of necessity as well as custom. Germany and China have developed economies that specifically promote and rely on exports. And as the World Trade Organization notes other factors, including the price of fuel and exchange rates, can affect the ratios. Portman argues the United States could expand its economy and develop a lot more jobs if it followed a more aggressive export path. We’re not here to debate trade policy, but we checked with experts in academia and at the World Bank to see if Portman’s way of measuring trade -- as a percentage of GDP -- was valid. Yes, they said. "That way of measuring trade is considered to be appropriate, although, as you recognize, those small relative numbers mask very large absolute numbers," Donald Boudreaux," a professor and authority on the economics of international trade at George Mason University, told us in an e-mail. Yet Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, a manufacturers’ group that focuses on domestic growth, took issue with the way Portman uses this export ratio. Portman left out a big part of the equation, Tonelson suggested.. That’s because if the United States accepts more trade agreements in order to expand exports, it is likely to result in more foreign goods coming into the United States, too. That’s the very problem with existing trade agreements, Tonelson and other critics say: The benefits of jobs supporting exports are outweighed by the jobs lost as companies move operations offshore to use their cheaper labor. "Unfortunately, far too many of these free trade agreements have been structured not to expand net U.S. exports but to boost net U.S. imports," Tonelson said in a telephone interview. "In fact, they have been aimed largely at outsourcing, and we know this because so many of them in the 1990s were signed with very low-income, very export-dependent countries like Mexico and China." We’re not going to settle that debate. Plenty of people, including Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also support going slow or applying the brakes on trade. But we’ll note that Portman has a lot fellow travelers, including President Barack Obama, who wants to double U.S. exports in the next five years. Even the administration of Ohio’s former governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, described exports as a bright spot in the state’s economy. So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter. Portman’s statement was made to bolster of a point of view. But economists say that Portman’s measure -- exports as a percentage of GDP -- is valid and useful. Dispute his goals if you wish, but Portman’s claim about the United States’ export rate is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim True.

pomt-01424	"The Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. It was put together by governors and by states."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/kay-hagan/kay-hagan-says-federal-government-didnt-create-com/	The Common Core education standards have not been popular with many Republicans, who say the guidelines will hamstring state school officials. At the debate for the U.S. Senate candidates from North Carolina on Oct. 7, Republican Thom Tillis described Common Core as regulatory overreach. Although he did not explicitly call it a federal mandate, his comments strongly implied that was the case: "What I oppose," he said, "is a bureaucracy, the Department of Education, that was not even created until 1980, after I graduated from high school, with 5,000 bureaucrats making on average $102,000 a year, stifling what teachers want to do in the classroom. The problem with Common Core is that teachers were being more worried about how they meet up to the standards than what they really want to do pursuing their passion educating the kids. Common Core, No Child Left Behind, Race To the Top all had strings attached to them." That prompted incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat, to say that Common Core was not a federal mandate. "The Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington," she said. "It was put together by governors and by states, setting high expectations for students all across this country so that we could not only compete against one another within our states but we would be more competitive on a global basis." Is Hagan correct that "Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington. It was put together by governors and by states"? Common Core's origins Conservatives around the country have attacked the Common Core State Standards, a set of benchmarks for English and math that were unveiled in 2010. The criticism has stirred debate about the federal government's role and whether the focus on them is strictly political. PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined the question in different ways. A claim by Wisconsin State Sen. Joe Leibham that Common Core is a federal mandate earned a False rating in July. An opposite claim in October 2013 -- that Common Core "is not from the federal government," that they "do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all" -- was rated Mostly True. The reality is that Common Core came out of years of discussion between private, nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal was to better prepare students for college and careers and to ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, that council and the National Governors Association agreed to create Common Core. They developed the standards with the help of teachers, parents and experts. Although Common Core is voluntary, the federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards. States earned a small number of extra points (40 of a possible 500) in the competition for grants from Race to the Top, Obama’s signature program that provided added money for education, if they adopted standards to prepare students for college and work. They didn't have to adopt Common Core, but they were better positioned to secure the federal money if they did. Our ruling In the North Carolina debate, Hagan said, "Common Core was not put together by the Department of Education in Washington," she said. "It was put together by governors and by states." She is right about how the program was assembled, although it’s worth noting that the federal government has given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-12449	U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies "charge five times more for people over 50."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/may/11/save-my-care/gop-health-care-bill-charges-five-times-more-peopl/	A group fighting against the Affordable Care Act repeal says that House Republicans voted for a health care bill that would lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers. Save My Care, a health care advocacy group, launched an ad attacking two dozen GOP House members who voted for the American Health Care Act including U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Miami. "Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions," the ad claims. The same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Florida’s Treasure Coast and members in many other states, including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV. Formed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated with Eric Kessler, a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clinton’s administration. It operates out of the same office as the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas. There were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to "charge five times more for people over 50." One provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market. Some viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero. What the ad doesn’t tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults — three times as much. Age ain’t nothing but a number (but it could make insurance more expensive) For this fact-check, we’re looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market. So this doesn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 "rate banding." The House bill increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adults’ health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the Rand Corporation, which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an interactive map to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. "Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA," Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A Congressional Budget Office analysis of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that person’s premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine essential health benefits for coverage in the individual market. "I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA," Blumberg said. Curbelo’s spokeswoman told us Curbelo has called for improving the bill that he voted for. "The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement," Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact. Our ruling The Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies "charge five times more for people over 50." The ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that it’s five times more than the current situation -- and that’s not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before). Also, the increase in the ratio applies to Americans ages 50-64 -- not seniors who are on Medicare. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01076	"Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/16/floridians-solar-choice/florida-one-five-states-ban-certain-solar-sales-pe/	When it comes to solar, the Sunshine State is, well, in the dark, say advocates. A coalition of folks across the political spectrum ranging from tea party activists to environmentalists have united to launch a campaign to allow the direct sale of solar energy to consumers. Currently, state law only allows utilities to sell power, but a new political action committee, Floridians for Solar Choice, wants to change that. The PAC seeks to get a referendum on the ballot for the 2016 election. They will need 683,149 signatures by Feb. 1, 2016 -- an effort that could cost millions of dollars. The PAC argues that Florida is out of touch with the majority of states on solar. "Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business," according to the group’s website. We decided to shed a little light on how Florida stacks up on solar energy. While solar has been expanding nationally, Florida isn’t a solar leader: it ranks third in solar capacity but 13th in installations, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar represents less than 1 percent of Florida's energy generation, and the state projects only a tiny fraction of percentage growth over the next decade. In November, the Public Service Commission approved allowing utilities to end solar rebates in 2015 and gut energy efficiency goals by 90 percent, because the utilities claimed neither is "cost-effective." The source of the data on the 5-state ban Florida law only allows a few utilities such as Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric to sell power directly to consumers. If a solar power generator wants to get into the state market, it must first sell to one of those utilities. Floridians for Solar Choice want to make it cheaper for residents to buy solar power directly from a provider. The evidence that only five states forbid that kind of direct sale comes from a map from the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE), a project based at North Carolina State University funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy. The map shows the states that allow third-party solar power agreements. Under power purchase agreements (PPAs), an installer/developer builds a solar system on a customer’s property for free and then the developer sells the power to the customer. The map, dated November 2014, shows that at least 24 states allow these third-party solar agreements - though in some states there are certain restrictions, such as only allowing them of a certain size or on a type of property. The five states that don’t allow any such agreements are Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The map shows the status as unclear or unknown in 21 states. The states that are unclear or are unknown are "because the statutory law is silent about the issue and from what we can gather, no solar companies in these states have attempted to sell electricity directly to a customer," said Brian Lips, DSIRE Project Manager. That means those 21 states are in a legal gray area, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association. "It isn’t specifically allowed or disallowed, but given the laws in place, it’s not hard to imagine that a court would uphold the utility’s exclusivity," Johnson said. "Most states don’t go so far to protect monopoly utilities, but Florida is one of them." Another way to compare states on solar We sent the group’s claim to spokespersons for Florida’s Public Service Commission and utilities including Duke Energy to ask if they had any information to refute or support the claim. A spokesman for Duke Energy directed us to Solar Power Rocks, a research and advocacy organization which ranks the states on solar policies. On this ranking, Florida landed in the middle of the pack with a "C" and 24th among the states. But this website doesn’t take into account the third-party PPAs -- it considers other factors such as whether states offer tax exemptions or rebates for solar. A spokeswoman for the Public Service Commission, Cindy Muir, questioned characterizing Florida as one of only five states with such a ban, since 21 states are classified as unknown. Muir also said that Florida law does allow leases for solar. Under that scenario, a developer installs the solar energy system and the customer pays for it over years rather than paying for the power produced. The advantage of the PPA is that the customer doesn’t hold the production risk. Under a lease, the customer can end up paying the same whether the system ends up producing 100 percent of expected electricity or a lesser amount, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Our ruling "Currently, Florida is one of only five states in the nation that prohibit citizens from buying electricity from companies that will put solar panels on your home or business," says Floridians for Solar Choice website. That statistic comes from a respected academic source that published its findings in 2014. However, the statement doesn’t mean that 45 states allow sales. Currently, 24 states specifically allow an entity to build a solar system on a customer’s property and then sell the power to the customer. In 21 states, the status is unclear or unknown, and pro-solar advocates say few if any sales are happening there. Still, the claim is accurate that only five states specifically prohibit these types of sales. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00797	"Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?"	true	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/06/randy-forbes/forbes-says-us-among-few-nations-without-offical-l/	What’s the official language of the United States? If you said English, you haven’t read U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes’ blog lately. "Did you know that the U.S. is one of the very few nations in the world without an official language?" Forbes, R-4th, wrote. We put the congressman’s claim to the test. Forbes’ office referred us to the CIA, which publishes "The World Factbook," a website of data on 240 nations, territories and regions. Among other things, it lists the languages spoken in each of the places and whether its government has sanctioned an official tongue. The CIA says that while 82 percent of people in the U.S. usually speak in English, our nation "has no official language." Forbes wants to change that. He’s among 31 cosponsors of a bill that would declare English the official language of the U.S. and require the federal government to transact just about all of its activities in English. Similar legislation has died in Congress in recent years. The practical effects of the legislation may be slim. We asked a representative of U.S. English, a group lobbying for an official language, how the bill would change the way government now operates. Matthew Shuman, the group’s manager of government relations, was hard pressed to come up with concrete examples. He said the bill would generally ease pressure on agencies to voluntarily help non-English speakers and that, in return, would improve efficiency. Many supporters find high symbolic value in the legislation. Efforts in recent decades to establish official English are tied to concerns about growing levels of immigration into the U.S., according to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service. Forbes, a critic of President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, blogged, "As a nation of immigrants created by a common thread of language, it is important that we protect the unity that the English language affords us." Opponents say the official English movement stigmatizes of people who are legally present in the U.S. but do not speak English in their homes. While the U.S. doesn’t have a sanctioned language, 31 states -- including Virginia -- have laws establishing English their official tongue. Virginia’s law, passed in 1996, says "no state agency or local government shall be required to provide...any documents, information, literature or any other written materials in any language other than English." There’s one piece of work left here. Forbes’ statement also says the U.S. is among few nations with no official language. So we need to spin the globe. There are 196 nations, according to infoplease.com, an online almanac. The CIA lists no official language for 14 of them. Aside from the U.S., they are American Samoa, Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Holy See, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mexico, San Marino and the United Kingdom.

pomt-04729	Clackamas County Commissioners "approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county’s contribution to TriMet’s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/30/clackamas-county-commission/did-clackamas-county-negotiate-199-million-trimet-/	A majority of the Clackamas County Board of Commissioners recently approved a new agreement that reduces the county’s share of paying for TriMet’s new Orange line project, better known as Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail. This prompted many pats on the back from the county. Here’s the first sentence from the county media release sent out to press: "Clackamas County Commissioners on Wednesday approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the county’s contribution to TriMet’s Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million and approved the sale of bonds to pay the obligation." The three commissioners who voted in favor put out statements congratulating their financial savvy. The re-election campaign of commission Chair Charlotte Lehan issued a press release that stated that "the new terms are expected to save Clackamas County taxpayers at least $6.6 million in general fund obligations." Commissioner Jamie Damon, also up for re-election in November, issued a campaign release that stated that the settlement would "save over $5 million -- a reduction of over 20 percent from the original $25 million project." Commissioner Ann Lininger, who is retiring, submitted a guest column to The Oregonian in which she said the county approved a $19.9 million financing plan and settlement terms to fulfill its obligations to TriMet. She also said the agreement enables the county "to avoid a late-payment penalty of as much as $1.25 million." Cool, right? Taxpayers love saving money. And commissioners probably think this is a good way to placate residents who are on the fence about a MAX line between Portland and Milwaukie. The agreement comes before a Sept. 18 election on a county ballot measure, which, if approved, would require voter approval before officials can spend money on light rail. Instead of singling out a commissioner, we will focus on the statement put out by the county since it sums up nicely the numbers on which the three-member majority wants to focus: $19.9 million versus $25 million. The new agreement with TriMet does slice $2.4 million from the $25 million. But that leaves a balance of $22.6 million, not $19.9 million. The county also agrees to other actions that are in-lieu of cash payment: Donate a parcel of land with a real market value of $20,915. Pay for road and signal improvements worth $1,279,740. Waive the county’s engineering fees, valued at $1,365,307. The total value of the listed in-kind contributions comes to $2,665,962 -- resources that could be used for other county services if they weren’t going toward light rail. Subtracting those contributions leaves a cash balance of $19,934,038 the county owes TriMet. In other words, $19.9 million. (The county isset to sell $19.1 million in bonds Sept. 6, toward the balance due.) The Oregonian’s Clackamas County reporter has consistently characterized the cost of the new agreement with TriMet as $22.6 million, even if the new amount that requires financing is lower. We think that’s more accurate, despite politicians’ inclinations to inflate. So does Dan Chandler, strategic policy administrator and the county’s point man on the subject. "The reduction in borrowing is $5 million, but the actual savings are less than that," Chandler said. The original agreement signed in February 2010 called for Clackamas County to pay TriMet $25 million toward the cost of the $1.5 billion project. Section 4.1 of the contract states the county could meet that amount by lump-sum payment or payments or in-kind contributions, or any combination. Let’s return to the statement: Did the commission approve a new deal that lowers the county’s contribution to $19.9 million, down from $25 million? It did not. The county’s financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22.6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations. Those are real dollars. We find the statement to be False.

pomt-00931	Says Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce’s "own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/25/wisconsin-contractor-coalition/contractors-say-business-support-right-work-law-mi/	More than 400 Wisconsin firms in construction contracting oppose the Republican push for a "right-to-work" law, which would block companies and workers from signing agreements requiring employees to pay union dues. Here’s how they explain their stance: They’re fine with the current set up, under which they employ 120,000 trades workers -- most in unions -- and collaborate with the unions on training, wages and workplace safety. This, the Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claims, helps attract new business and jobs, while right to work "compromises each of these, infringes on the rights of private businesses and is a detriment to Wisconsin’s overall economy and tax base." Meanwhile, state manufacturing firms and some other big businesses are rallying on the other side, contending Wisconsin workers deserve the freedom to work and receive the benefit of unions without paying dues. The Contractor Coalition’s website makes this claim about Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby: "WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation." That would be a jaw-droppingly low number. Let’s check the evidence. Surveying WMC members Twice in the last seven months, WMC has publicized some results from surveys of executives whose firms belong to the group. We’ve reported on the limitations of these surveys before: They don’t represent a random sample of the group’s membership or of businesses statewide. A small minority of CEOs typically respond to the questions. And the group does not publicly post the wording of questions. During the summer 2014, the survey sent to 1,200 executives asked for the top thing state government could do to improve the business climate. In all, 261 execs filled out the survey. From a list of eight concerns, the top change sought was "reduce taxes" (35 percent), a WMC news release reported. Second was "become a right to work state" (15 percent), WMC spokesman Jim Pugh told us. Trailing that, in no particular order, were education reform/school choice, affordable health care, reduce regulations, tort reform, reduce spending and economic development. Pugh said 15 percent making it their top priority was a "huge number." But Stephen Lyons, a spokesman for the Contractor Coalition, argues the result showed the lack of urgency among WMC members on right to work. The trouble here for the Contractor Coalition is that the survey did not gauge support for right to work, as it claimed. Rather, it showed the intensity level executives felt about right to work when compared to other priorities. The coalition’s website, where the claim was made, went live in December 2014. At that time, the survey was the most recent by WMC on the topic. Since then, WMC released partial results from a survey that ended in January 2015. That survey directly asked: "Would you support state legislation to allow individual private sector workers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to join a labor union (Right to Work) or do you support current Wisconsin law that mandates union membership (Closed Shop)?" The question is flawed because it misstates current law, three veteran employment and labor attorneys -- Mark Sweet, Michael Aldana and Peter Davis -- told us in separate interviews. Since at least 1947, "closed shops" -- which require that only union members be hired -- have been illegal. Under current law, unions and the company can agree on contracts that require newly hired employees to pay the equivalent of union dues. In these so-called "union shops" workers do not have to join the union but pay a share of the unions costs for collective bargaining and other services. A right to work law would bar employers from entering into these type of agreements. Twenty-four states have such laws on the books. One footnote: As a practical matter, in the construction industry, many collective bargaining agreements require employers to hire through union halls, though non-union workers can also get on hiring hall lists. In addition, the WMC question’s phrasing is tilted toward right to work with the positive "freedom" description while inaccurately describing current law as a mandate. With those major caveats in mind, here’s what the 2015 WMC survey found: 81 percent (250 of 308 respondents) favored a right to work law. The Contractor Coalition calls that number misleading, saying WMC has 3,600 members, so only 7 percent came forward to say the favored right to work. Maybe so. But the survey went out to 1,200 executives, not the full membership. And the coalition’s own claim clearly referred to the favorability rating among "respondents" to the survey. Our rating The Wisconsin Contractor Coalition claimed: "WMC’s own 2014 survey revealed that just 15 percent of business executive respondents were in favor of Right-To-Work legislation." This is a misstatement of the WMC survey results, the first of which showed 15 percent of respondents wanted right to work as their number one priority, but were not asked whether they favored it. The second survey, though flawed as noted, found 81 percent of responding executives favored right to work. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04242	Says New Jersey is "50th in return of our federal tax dollars."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/18/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-jersey-receives-smallest-r/	New Jersey doesn’t just need a lot of federal aid to rebuild a coastline ravaged by Hurricane Sandy, the state also deserves it, according to Gov. Chris Christie. NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams asked Christie recently if it’s fair for people who have no interests in the Jersey Shore to ask, "Why the money? Why the effort, if this is the new normal?" "Well, listen, it's fair to ask it but I have the answer," Christie said during the Oct. 30 interview. "The answer is that for New Jersey, which gives so much to this country -- by the way, 50th in return of our federal tax dollars. So New Jerseyans send more than any other state in America in federal taxes, getting back less. When that's done and you see that our state is a state that needs this to contribute to our economy and also to the soul and the vibrancy of our state, I think we have very good answers and arguments to make. And you count on one thing: you're looking at the guy who is going to make those arguments." With Christie building part of his case for federal assistance around the state’s return on federal tax dollars, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his premise is true. Add "Donor State" to the list of New Jersey’s monikers. Depending on the year -- and whether adjustments are made to federal data -- New Jersey ranks at or near the bottom nationwide in this category. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, tracked how much the federal government collected through taxes and returned through expenditures to states every year from 1981 to 2005. The Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis. In 17 of those 25 years, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government. In 2005 -- the most recent year analyzed by the Tax Foundation -- the federal government gave New Jersey 61 cents for every dollar it took. That was the smallest return of any state. But that was seven years ago. Though the Tax Foundation hasn’t updated its findings, other studies show New Jersey still ranks near the bottom. The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey. New Jersey ranked 48th in the nation. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009, according to the report, which relied on raw, unadjusted data. PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of federal data from 2010 also put New Jersey in 48th place. So even the raw data put New Jersey near the bottom in this category. But Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in an e-mail, that "the news behind this is not all bad." In the report, Cain attributes the low ranking to New Jersey’s "relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid. It does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally." Our ruling Christie said that New Jersey is "50th in return of our federal tax dollars." The Tax Foundation’s analysis of 2005 data, which was adjusted to reflect each state’s overall federal tax burden, ranked New Jersey 50th in the nation in this category. The state received 61 cents for every dollar it sent to Washington, D.C. that year. Though that research is outdated, more recent analysis of raw data shows New Jersey still ranks near the bottom. On the Truth-O-Meter, Christie’s statement registers as Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2012-11-18T07:30:00	2012-10-30	['None']
pomt-14255	Says there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Donald Trump in the state’s 2016 Republican primary virtually all getting tallied for Marco Rubio.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/apr/11/committee-restore-americas-greatness/pants-fire-claim-there-were-over-600-reports-trump/	According to a super PAC supporting New Yorker Donald Trump for president, Texas Republicans just experienced a wagon’s worth of election fraud, all oddly to the good for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (who later dropped out of the race). We read the post on stopthesteal.org on April 6, 2016 while looking into a claim by Republican consultant Frank Luntz who had said in a tweet that Team Trump "has accused Ted Cruz," the Texas senator battling Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, of fraud in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin. That’s Half True, we found. Luntz, by way of offering factual backup for his claim, guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org, the website for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness, a super PAC created in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially Rubio, according to a Reuters news story at the time. The web post aired concerns about fraud in seven states including Texas after stating the Trump Ballot Security Project was formed "when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the" March 2016 "Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case," the post says, "votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio." Cruz handily won the state’s March 1, 2016, primary with 43 percent of the GOP vote. Trump finished second (27 percent) and Rubio third (18 percent); Ohio Gov. John Kasich landed fourth with 4 percent, according to the Texas secretary of state. We asked Stone about the basis of stopthesteal.org’s proclaimed Texas irregularities. By email, he initially noted the ballot security project had shifted to its own website though the provided address didn't lead to any web page just a few days later. Stone further said affidavits collected from voters in multiple states hadn’t been made public and, he said, such issues would be in the jurisdiction of a credentials committee at the July 2016 Republican National Convention. "The form of evidence of voter irregularities the" party’s "credentials committee finds compelling is up to the committee and no requirement that a complaint with the state election board or report to party officials is required to make a claim," Stone wrote, adding that the affidavits would be submitted to the committee if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel "elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected" through "a pattern of voter fraud." Stone said the pro-Trump super PAC has "collected over 2,200 individual SWORN affidavits documenting voter irregularities in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah and Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona. 738 of these are in Texas in at least eight counties. We are NOT finished collecting affidavits in Utah and Wisconsin," Stone said. "Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign," Stone said. Before reaching Stone, we hunted for news reports about stopthesteal.org’s described irregularities and also looked for its declared 600-plus reports of Texas votes for Trump actually going to Rubio. Those searches came up empty save for an Austin radio host’s mention of unsubstantiated complaints. A video dated March 1, 2016 shows an interview of Todd Jeffries, co-host of KLBJ-AM’s morning "Todd and Don Show," by a reporter for the conspiracy-minded InfoWars.com. In the interview, Jeffries said the show had surprisingly fielded about a dozen phone calls from Austin-area voters saying their Trump votes incorrectly showed up as Rubio votes; he didn’t indicate if the concerned voters uniformly fixed such errors before finalizing their ballots. Next, to our inquiries, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas and the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party each said he hadn’t heard or seen any reports of Trump votes being recorded for Rubio--or Cruz. Mike Joyce, the state party spokesman, said by phone said he hadn’t seen even one such news story. "I would have heard about it," if so, Joyce said. "It would have been brought to our attention." Joyce said that when he heard about the calls to KLBJ-AM suggesting ballot problems, he checked with James Dickey, chairman of the Travis County GOP, who reported back that he’d heard no such reports from polling places. Dickey said by phone he heard "limited reports" about Trump votes showing up for Rubio, but nothing was confirmed. To our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer, said she couldn’t comment on formal complaints pending review and investigation. That said, Alicia Phillips Pierce said, the agency didn’t receive 600 written complaints in connection with the 2016 primaries. Pierce said the agency fielded less than a dozen "calls from individuals concerned that votes may have been changed from Trump to Rubio," but no one "indicated they had experienced the supposed phenomena themselves or had any direct knowledge of what allegedly occurred. Instead, they were only responding to second-hand reports they heard on the radio or saw online," she said. Stone dismissed the lack of confirmation from Texas news reports, writing: "Old media. Proves nothing." He also put no stock in the responses we’d drawn from Pierce and on behalf of the state and Travis County Republicans. "Why would they admit it?" Stone wrote. Our ruling A pro-Trump super PAC said there were over 600 reports of Texas votes for Trump virtually all getting tallied for Rubio. If so, those reports are no longer public, which leaves us to speculate about the content of the unreleased affidavits described by Trump backer Stone.

pomt-04420	Says "as Co-Chair of the Joint Ways & Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for" the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/15/mary-nolan/did-mary-nolan-really-secure-funding-new-bridge-pr/	It’s been nearly 40 years since Portlanders have seen a new bridge constructed over the Willamette River. That will change soon with the addition of the Milwaukie light rail bridge, scheduled to be up and running by fall 2015. Once the deck starts going up and the cables are attached, it’ll be one of the most visible public works projects for the city in some time. It’s little wonder, then, that Portland City Council candidate Mary Nolan is touting on her website her role in making it happen. "We’re building the first new bridge across the Willamette in more than 40 years, this one dedicated to transit, pedestrian and bike traffic," she writes on her website. "As Co-Chair of the Joint Ways & Means Committee, I secured the key piece of funding for this important project." We see a lot of claims like these -- where folks who sat on a committee claim some crucial role. Sometimes it’s real, sometimes it’s a stretch. We wondered what the situation was here. We called TriMet to figure out what the deal was with the Legislature’s funding contribution for the project. Spokeswoman Mary Fetsch pointed us to House Bill 5036 from 2007, which authorized $250 million worth of lottery bonds for the project. The funding at the state level was itself instrumental in securing matching federal dollars. Back in 2007, Nolan was, indeed, a co-chair of the budget writing committee, along with now-Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s fair to say that, as co-chairs of the committee, they had final say on how the dollars were spent. We wondered, though, just how big a role Nolan played in this particular get for the city of Portland. We spoke with TriMet lobbyist Olivia Clark. She described the process as a group effort. She ticked off several names -- Rep. Carolyn Tomei, Rep. Dave Hunt, now-U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, now-Secretary of State Kate Brown and Schrader -- as essential in getting the funding secured. As for Nolan, she called the candidate’s involvement "vital." "She was definitely a leader in the effort," Clark said. On Clark’s advice, we also spoke with Schrader, who confirmed Nolan’s role in the effort as essential saying that "Mary was big on this piece." When we spoke with Nolan, she talked about how she had held firm on getting the full amount in 2007 -- even after the governor’s office had pushed to hold off until 2009 or to split the sum between two bienniums. "I said ‘No’ and Schrader backed me up," Nolan said. "It was critical for the metropolitan region." Clark, the lobbyist, recalled a similar negotiation when we spoke with her earlier. Nolan said she "secured the key piece of funding" for the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project bridge. It might be nice if that read "helped secure" instead -- it was certainly a group effort. But based on committee assignments and interviews with two people closest to the negotiations, it does appear that Nolan played a key role. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04057	People committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the Baker Act will get their guns back "automatically and immediately upon discharge....and their commitment is never entered into a background check database."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/25/mike-ryan/do-police-automatically-return-guns-someone-after-/	Following the shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan has become one of the leading advocates in Broward County for changing laws to improve school safety. Ryan, a member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, called for several measures, including the need to address mental health and guns, in the political blog BrowardBeat.com. "Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours AND their commitment is never entered into a background check database," said Ryan, in a guest column on Jan. 14. "As a result, there is also no impediment or second thought given to someone being released and purchasing a gun." Ryan’s claim suggests that it’s a cinch for someone "committed" for up to three days under the Baker Act to reclaim their guns, and that they stay off any list that would ban them from getting a new one. We wanted to check to see if Ryan was correct. What is the Baker Act? Under the Baker Act, law enforcement can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. A person can’t be held involuntarily for longer than 72 hours, but a medical expert needs to examine the person and sign off on his or her release. We should point out that the simple act of being held under the Baker Act doesn’t mean the person is mentally ill or in need of commitment. In 2010, less than 1 percent of about 140,000 involuntary examinations led to involuntary placement in a mental health treatment facility, according to the Florida Department of Children and Families. This number doesn’t account for people who voluntarily remained in facilities. The Baker Act doesn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. So law enforcement can take their guns when they are transported to a facility under the Baker Act. We couldn’t find data regarding how often someone who is Baker Acted has their firearm taken. "Most individuals don’t have weapons at the time of the Baker Act," said Miami-Dade County Judge Steve Leifman, who chairs judicial committees on mental health. But interviews with attorneys, law enforcement officers and experts on the Baker Act revealed, it does happen. We consistently heard from law enforcement that whether they take the gun for safekeeping depends on the specific case. For example, if a wife calls police to report that her husband is despondent and has a gun, and he is Baker Acted at home, police would take the gun, said Hillsborough Sheriff Col. Jim Previtera. But if someone is Baker Acted on the street and didn’t have a gun on him, the sheriff’s office wouldn’t go to his home and seize the gun. Under the Baker Act, people who haven’t committed crimes are not supposed to be treated as criminals and they do retain their constitutional rights -- including the right to own a gun. So do they get their guns back? A 2009 Florida Attorney General opinion specifically states that law-abiding people who are released under the Baker Act should get their guns back. "In the absence of an arrest and criminal charge against the person sent for evaluation under Florida's Baker Act, (law enforcement) may not retain firearms confiscated from such persons and retained by that office," concluded then Attorney General Bill McCollum. The opinion didn’t outline procedures for gun retrieval. That means "there is absolutely no consistency around the state in how this is being practiced," according to former state Baker Act director Martha Lenderman, who now trains law enforcement. How do police deal with firearms and Baker Act? We contacted a few law enforcement agencies and other experts about how the gun retrieval is handled. "You are supposed to get your gun back automatically, but rarely does that happen because they are in the hands of the police department," said Jon Gutmacher, an Orlando defense attorney and former Broward prosecutor who specializes in firearm cases. In Ryan’s city of Sunrise, the police department doesn’t have a written policy on returning guns after a Baker Act. There have been multiple cases where the department required a court order, Deputy Chief Gerald Eddy told PolitiFact Florida. But there have been times when gun owners tell Sunrise police that the law doesn’t require a court order and threaten litigation. In such cases, the department has to decide whether to still require the court order. (Ryan told us that he has directed city officials to write a policy to require a court order in all cases "while we advocate for the law to be changed to relieve us of the obligation to return guns to those Baker Acted.") We found many law enforcement agencies -- including the sheriff’s offices in Broward and Hillsborough and police departments in the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and nearby town of Davie -- do require a court order. Miami-Dade requires a court order if the person used the gun to breach the peace but not if the medically cleared person didn’t use it to breach the peace, Det. Javier Baez said. In Broward, gun owners must fill out paperwork and pay a filing fee that generally ranges between $55 and $300 depending on the cost of their gun. It usually takes 30 to 45 days to get a hearing. If the law enforcement agency doesn’t object, then a mediator signs off and the judge grants the order. Donna Johnson, manager of county civil court, estimated Broward has about six to 10 such hearings a year. In Hillsborough, which doesn’t charge the gun owners a fee, the judge may ask the person to describe what happened that led to the Baker Act evaluation and some other questions, said Jason Gordillo, Hillsborough sheriff’s office legal counsel who has handled such cases for 10 years. The judge looks for any legal grounds that would ban the person from getting their gun back -- for example a convicted felon or someone with a domestic violence injunction. Usually after a brief hearing the judge issues the order to return the gun. "They can pick it up that day if they want," Gordillo said. The same procedures are used in cases that involved other law enforcement agencies within Hillsborough, he said. The Pasco County Sheriff's Office doesn’t have a written policy but handles these matters on a case-by-case basis, spokesman Kevin Doll said. He said the usual requirements for return of a gun include Baker Act hospital discharge records, a letter from a licensed mental health professional stating the person is of sound mind and he is of no harm if the firearm is returned to him, and proof of ownership. "We cannot compel a person to provide their medical records (HIPAA rules), but if they want their weapons back without a court order, they must provide the requested documents," Doll told PolitiFact in an email. Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office handles such matters on a case-by-case basis and does not have a written policy. "We often have told them to get a court order to retrieve the weapon, but again, technically nothing in the law allows us to require a court order," Sgt. David DiSano said. When a Baker Act leads to a commitment Ryan’s claim related to when someone is released after a Baker Act evaluation after 72 hours -- and therefore isn’t committed (even though he used the word committed). But we also wondered if someone can get their gun back if they are committed for longer treatment. Individuals who had been committed may petition the court to restore their gun rights and the court must rule in their favor if it determines the person is not a threat to public safety. (The state attorney can object.) Baker Act and background checks Before ringing up a gun sale, federal firearms licensees must contact the FBI or other designated agency to check National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to see if the person is banned from having a gun. (Read about the gaps in this reporting system here.) Since an evaluation under the Baker Act does not equal commitment, it is not entered into the FBI’s database. Any person who has been "adjudicated as a mental defective" or "committed to a mental institution" is prohibited under federal law from possessing any firearm. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also maintains a similar database based on court records. Some people who have a Baker Act evaluation do have mental illness, but they also can stabilize and remain functional throughout their lives, said Lenderman. She said the state needs more clear public policy on when to take -- and when to give back -- guns taken in Baker Act cases. "Simply having a diagnosis of a medical disorder, which it is, should not deprive you of constitutional rights unless certain criteria have been met," she said. "The law only says if you have a commitment of a court for involuntary placement is that going to take place. ... I hate to see further stigmatization of people with mental illness as though they are all dangerous people -- that is just flat out not true." Blanket policies that attempt to stop people with mental illness from obtaining guns can be both overinclusive and underinclusive, said Ron Honberg, a director at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The key is identifying people who are violent -- not simply those who have a mental illness. Some of the shooters in recent mass shootings were unknown to the mental health system and therefore wouldn’t have been on such a banned list anyway, he said. "I understand the knee-jerk let’s keep guns out of the hands of all people with mental illness (but) it's pretty complicated." We asked Ryan how he thinks Florida law should handle people who have had a Baker Act evaluation and access to guns. "The law should require that someone who has been Baker Acted to prove by some standard they are mentally fit to have their guns returned and in the interim be prohibited from purchasing weapons," he wrote in an email. We asked Ryan to explain why he wrote that the guns are returned "automatically and immediately upon discharge" if many cities actually require a court order. "If the AG opinion is read that such ‘property’ can not be withheld, then the return would be automatic … that is, without restriction. Immediacy would be without the delay of court hearings or evaluation by mental professionals and upon request. There would be no reason for delay. They can walk out of the institution, go to the police department and request return immediately," he wrote. "That is the import of the AG's opinion." Our ruling Ryan made a two-part claim about the Baker Act and guns. First, he said "Now someone committed involuntarily for 72 hours under the ‘Baker Act’ (as a danger to themselves or others) will have their guns returned to them by the police automatically and immediately upon discharge after 72 hours..." Those who are released after a Baker Act evaluation are entitled to get their guns back, the state’s former attorney general wrote in an opinion. Many law enforcement agencies require a court order, a process than can take several weeks. The second part of Ryan’s claim, "and their commitment is never entered into a background check database," is close to correct. It would be more accurate to say that "their evaluation under the Baker Act is never entered into a background check database." An evaluation itself is not commitment, and therefore the law stating that a commitment would preclude someone from having a weapon doesn’t apply. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07668	Says it’s a "statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/10/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-single-moms-very-poor-under-edu/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a possible contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, caused a firestorm when he criticized movie star Natalie Portman. Speaking to conservative radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, "One of the things that is troubling is that people see a Natalie Portman or some other Hollywood starlet who boasts of, 'Hey look, we're having children, we're not married, but we're having these children, and they're doing just fine.’ But there aren't really a lot of single moms out there who are making millions of dollars every year for being in a movie." After the comment hit the wider airwaves, Huckabee posted the following comment on the website of HuckPac, his political action committee. "In a recent media interview about my new book, A Simple Government, I discussed the first chapter, ‘The Most Important Form of Government Is a Father, Mother, and Children,’" he wrote. "I was asked about Oscar-winner Natalie Portman's out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Natalie is an extraordinary actor, very deserving of her recent Oscar, and I am glad she will marry her baby's father. However, contrary to what the Hollywood media reported, I did not ‘slam’ or ‘attack’ Natalie Portman, nor did I criticize the hardworking single mothers in our country. My comments were about the statistical reality that most single moms are very poor, under-educated, can't get a job, and if it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death. That's the story that we're not seeing, and it's unfortunate that society often glorifies and glamorizes the idea of having children out of wedlock." A reader suggested we check into the "statistical reality" of single mothers. So we did. The best statistics we found to analyze this issue come from a Census Bureau data set called "America’s Families and Living Arrangements: 2010." One way of analyzing the question comes from a table of statistics detailing living arrangements for children under 18 years and the marital status of their parents. These statistics, released in November 2010, offer per-child data. Other tables look at the data from the point of view of the households, rather than the children. Either way, the statistics are broadly similar. We’ll take Huckabee’s claims one by one. "Most single moms are very poor." While only a minority of children in single-mother households officially live below the poverty level, the income picture still isn’t rosy. All told, 43 percent of such children are officially in households below the poverty level, and an additional 28 percent are in households that earn less than twice the poverty level. Less than a third -- 30 percent -- live in households that earn more than that. By contrast, only 13 percent children in dual-parent households (whether married or not) live in households that are at or below the poverty level. An additional 19 percent live in households that have less than twice the poverty level. A full 68 percent live in households with incomes double the poverty level or higher. Looked at by household, slightly under 40 percent of single-mother households are officially below the poverty level. There is no accepted definition of "very poor," so the claim is hard to nail down. But children in single-mother households are more than twice as likely as those in dual-parent households to be part of families that earn less than twice the poverty level. So Huckabee has a point on this statistic. Most single moms are "under-educated." Like "very poor," the term "under-educated" is somewhat subjective. But we’ll look at the educational patterns for single moms and dual-parent households. Nineteen percent of children in single-mother households have a mom who failed to earn a high-school diploma, compared to 67 percent who graduated high school and/or attended some college, and 14 percent who have a college degree or higher. The comparable figures for children in dual-parent households is 8 percent with less than a high-school diploma, 47 percent with a high school degree and/or some college, and 45 percent with a college degree or higher. So it’s true that children with single moms are more than twice as likely those of dual-parent households to be the child of a high-school dropout. On the other hand, a full 81 percent of children of single moms have a mom who graduated from high school. That’s lower than the 92 percent rate for dual-parent households, but it still seems a stretch to say that "most" single moms are "under-educated." Most single moms "can't get a job." In single-mother households, 74 percent of moms are considered "in the labor force," compared to 26 percent who are "not in the labor force." Being "in the labor" force means that you are either working or are trying to. So we have to look to a separate statistic from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see whether single moms are actually being employed, rather than merely trying. The data shows that in 2009, about 66 percent of single moms were employed, with an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent. (The employment rate was higher and the unemployment rate was lower the previous year, before the worst of the recession hit.) How does employment compare between single moms and married moms? According to calculations for PolitiFact by Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, the data show that single moms are actually likelier to work than married moms. For mothers with the youngest child under age 6, nearly 68 percent are in the labor force -- that is, either working or looking for work. The comparable number for married moms living with their spouses is 62 percent. For those with the youngest child between 6 and 17 years of age, 79 percent of single moms were in the labor force, compared to 77 percent of married moms. Burtless found that rates of actual employment are also very close between the two groups. "The crucial thing he missed -- and that many Republicans don’t seem to understand -- is that a lot of those mothers do work," said Ron Haskins, who as a Republican congressional staffer helped write the 1996 welfare reform bill. "The government has done a lot to basically force them to work. That was the essence of welfare reform." So, any way you look at it, a large majority of single moms are both part of the workforce and are successful at getting jobs. On this statistic, Huckabee is completely off base. "If it weren't for government assistance, their kids would be starving to death." Among children with single mothers, 41 percent get food stamps and 59 percent don’t. By contrast, 11 percent in dual-parent households get food stamps and 89 percent do not. Meanwhile, 10 percent of children in single-mother households get other kinds of cash assistance while 90 percent do not. For those in dual-parent households, 2 percent get cash assistance and 98 percent do not. (The statistics can vary depending on how you define cash assistance; we’re going by the Census Bureau’s definition.) Looked at by household, 32 percent of single-mother households get food stamps, while 16 percent get cash assistance. So while the rates of food stamp and public assistance use are certainly higher among single-mother households, they still represent a minority of single-mother households. It seems like a stretch for Huckabee to say that "most" kids of single-mother households would starve without public assistance. "Single mothers are a highly disadvantaged group in many ways," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "But they are not quite so badly off as Huckabee says. In fact, a large majority of them are managing to remain gainfully employed even in the depths of this terrible economy." What is meant by 'single mothers'? Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor who was previously a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the numbers we found didn't surprise him much, though he did note that some people use the term "single mother" to mean "mother who had a child while single." To be extra cautious, we checked out this category separately. The best number we could find to approximate that group was the "never married" statistic, which excludes mothers who became single as a result of being widowed, separated, divorced or abandoned by a spouse. We found that the numbers are somewhat more dire for this subgroup than they are for single mothers as a whole, but not dramatically so. On education, 24 percent had less than a high-school diploma, compared to 19 percent for all single moms. Food stamp use was 50 percent, compared to 41 percent for all single moms, and 14 percent got public assistance, compared to 10 percent for all single moms. A full 70 percent of never-married single moms were in the work force, compared to 74 percent for all single moms. The one factor that showed the biggest variation was poverty. More than half -- 51 percent -- of never-married single moms are officially at the poverty line, and an additional 26 percent are between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level. That compares to 43 percent of all single moms officially below the poverty level and an additional 28 percent at less than twice the poverty level. But this was already the statistic where Huckabee was closest to being right. Our conclusion Even if the numbers for never-married moms had been dramatically different, we don't think it would justify Huckabee's comment, since the his wording didn’t distinguish among types of single moms. We should also note that Portman has said she plans to marry the baby’s father, so she would actually fit best into the "living with both parents, not married to each other" category, which we included in our "dual-parent household" category, not the "single-mother" category. So where does this leave us? There’s a pretty strong case that Huckabee is right about poverty in single-mother households. But his claims about educational attainment and government assistance are exaggerated, and the majority of kids living with single moms put food on the table without public assistance. And one claim is flat-out wrong -- that single moms aren’t able to get jobs. Lots of single mothers do -- often in higher rates than married moms. On balance, we rate Huckabee’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00453	"Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/blog-posting/will-being-single-kill-you/	Finding a date can feel like a life or death situation. According to Wonderneed, an clickbait news site, it actually might be. An article has the headline, "Science says that being single will kill you faster than obesity." Facebook users shared the #relatable content over 9,000 times in less than a week. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to find out if being single was a health risk. The danger of loneliness The article focuses on a 2017 press release about the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association. Dr. Julianna Holt-Lunstad, professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, gave a presentation about the public health hazard of loneliness. Her team analyzed 218 studies that examined the connection between social isolation and mortality. In these studies, researchers would track a group of subjects over the course of years. In some studies, participants would report how lonely they felt. In others, their loneliness was measured more objectively, based on the number of social connections an individual had or whether they lived alone. Holt-Lunstad and her team found that lonely people were 50 percent more likely to die during the period of observation than those with good social connections. For comparison, obese individuals have a 45 percent higher risk of death, based on a 2016 Harvard study. So, based on these stats, loneliness is just as much as, if not slightly more, of a health risk than obesity. The Wonderneed article, though, doesn’t say loneliness is more dangerous than obesity; it says being single is. Holt-Lunstad’s study didn’t focus on romance. Romantic relationships were included as social connections, she explained to us, but the result "wasn’t specific to being single." Based solely on her meta-analysis, the article cannot conclude that a lack of romance is the health risk. Phew. The speed of death The headline also mischaracterizes what these stats mean in practice. It claims that being single "will kill you faster" than obesity. The mere act of being single is not killing anyone. It is the loneliness associated with being single that might carry the risk. Second, none of these studies mention the element of time. Researchers measured the number of isolated people who died over the course of the study and compared it to the number of well-connected people who died. Because significantly more isolated people passed away, they concluded that loneliness was a health risk. The same method would be used to measure the risk of obesity: If 15 percent of the obese sample died, and only 3 percent of the non-obese sample did, researchers would know that obesity was a health risk. It is misleading to say that one would kill faster than the other. All the single ladies = all the lonely ladies? While the Wonderneed claim is incorrect, we’re sure you’re wondering: Are single people at a higher risk for death than those who are married? Other research has taken on the question of romance and health more directly. A study from 2011 showed that single people had a 24 percent increased risk for mortality. Especially within younger, healthier age groups, a single person is significantly more likely to die than someone married. Researchers found that, among 30-somethings, being single increased health risks by 128 percent. It’s unclear why this phenomenon exists. It could be because risk-takers are less likely to marry, and more likely to do stupid nonsense (emphasis ours). Or, unmarried people may have less access to health care and resources that married couples have. Perhaps, seriously ill people are getting married less often than healthy people, so it just seems like singles are more likely to die. Regardless of the underlying reason, though, the statistics paint a dark future for the unlucky-in-love. The health risks for being single are lower than those of being lonely or obese, but still significant. Our ruling The article by Wonderneed claimed that "science says being single will kill you faster than obesity." But the article cites an analysis on loneliness, not on romantic relationships. Studies have shown that loneliness can be a significant health concern, increasing a person’s risk of death by 50 percent. This is a higher rate than that of obesity, which increases health risks by 45 percent. But none of the studies actually examine the speed at which someone dies. We rate this statement Mostly False.
