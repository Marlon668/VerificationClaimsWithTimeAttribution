pomt-10035	"We are making the largest investment in education in our nation’s history."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/barack-obama/federal-government-yes-big-school-spending/	As President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus bill, he said it marked a historic investment in education. "Because we know America can't outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today, we're making the largest investment in education in our nation's history," Obama said at a bill signing ceremony at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science on Feb. 17, 2009. That's quite a claim — the largest ever? It's true that a substantial chunk of the stimulus is targeted to education. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in this press release that the bill "provides more than $100 billion in education funding and college grants and tuition tax credits, as well as billions more for school modernization." This chart from the Wall Street Journal indicates $115 billion of the $787 billion goes to education in one way or another. That includes, among other things, $22 billion for school construction and repair, $41 billion for states to balance education budgets, $650 million for computer and science labs, $17 billion for Pell Grants, and $14 million for Education Department spending oversight (which we dare say seems like money well spent in light of what precedes it). That money will be spent over the next two years, a spokesman told us. For Obama to even be in the ballpark of being the largest ever, we have to assume that he was comparing the funding to prior spending by the federal government exclusively. It's important to realize that the vast majority of money spent on education in this country is spent by states and localities. Of the money spent at the elementary and secondary level, over 91 percent comes from nonfederal sources, according to the Education Department. Even $115 billion won't change that balance substantially. So we'll assume that Obama meant the largest single investment by the federal government. As we look back on the history of federal education funding, we find no single effort comes close, even after adjusting for inflation. The New Deal contained little in the way of education spending. After the Soviet Union succeeded in placing the Sputnik 1 satellite in orbit, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to bolster math and science education — but that was a modest program by today's standards. Lyndon B. Johnson dramatically increased federal support for education with the Great Society programs, persuading Congress to pass the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965, the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1965 and Project Head Start. Those efforts marked a turning point in federal support for education, but experts in education budgeting told us they received just a few billion dollars — very little compared to today's education spending, even before the stimulus. For example, the Elementary and Secondary School Act was funded with $1.3 billion initially, according to the book Depression to Cold War , which amounts to around $9 billion in current dollars. Head Start received less than $1 billion. These programs have grown over time, so that the real competition to Obama's stimulus spending, several experts said, comes from the Education Department's annual budget from recent years. As this chart shows, it has risen steadily over the past 30 years, from $13.1 billion in 1980 (in 2007 dollars) to $23.2 billion in 1990 to $34.1 billion in 2000 to $73 billion in 2007. Tom Skelly, director of budget service at the Education Department, said via e-mail that the stimulus money is "in addition to our 2009 regular appropriation that will be over $59 billion. So in the department alone, we will have about $160 billion in discretionary appropriations." That's far higher than the department's budget has ever been. Other departments in the federal government also spend money on education through scholarship programs, school lunches and the like, amounting to total federal spending of about $170 billion a year. But there's no reason to believe those other programs won't continue this year as well, pushing total federal education spending to new heights. "It is the largest federal investment in education," Skelly wrote of the stimulus money, standing behind Obama's claim. It does appear that the stimulus money will push federal spending on education — both within the Education Department and across the federal government as a whole — higher than it has ever been. We find Obama's claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-02-27T14:19:01	2009-02-17	['None']

pomt-10995	"Broward County Sheriff fired for lying about Parkland."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/12/yournewswirecom/no-broward-sheriff-scott-israel-was-not-fired-gov-/	A false story on Facebook says Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired in a cover-up stemming from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. "Broward County Sheriff fired for lying about Parkland," said the July 3 headline on Your News Wire, a frequent purveyor of fake news. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. While the headline and the first paragraph says that Israel has been fired, the story was lifted from another website that said Israel will be fired. Big League Politics, a website with a conservative bent, wrote on July 3 that Israel was set to be removed the following week for unspecified "criminal issues" following an investigation by Gov. Rick Scott. It cited information from an anonymous source at the sheriff’s office. The story was written by Laura Loomer, a conservative activist we have written about before. We emailed Loomer and did not get a reply. We also did not get a reply from Your News Wire. Israel’s personal attorney Stuart Kaplan said on the WFTL-850 morning show disputed Loomer’s report. We didn’t get a response from Israel’s media relations staff at the sheriff’s office. The idea that Scott was going to suspend Israel has not been reported by other credible news outlets. We asked Scott’s office if he plans to suspend Israel, and a spokeswoman said that he will review the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation once it is complete. Scott ordered that investigation into the law enforcement response in February following the Valentine’s Day shooting. Israel has faced scrutiny for his office’s response to the shooting, including the fact that the school resource officer, Scot Peterson, took position outside of the school rather than go in and engage the shooter. The department is months away from finalizing its investigation and then will submit it to the Broward state attorney for review, an FDLE spokeswoman said. The governor has the power to suspend public officials for malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony. Scott has largely suspended public officials who have been accused of crimes. If Scott removes Israel, a Democrat, he could appoint a replacement in the Democratic-majority county. (Scott, a Republican, is running against Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in the Nov. 6 election.)

pomt-07502	The newly proposed House Republican budget "abolishes Medicare within 10 years."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/11/moveon/moveonorg-says-proposed-house-republican-budget-ab/	Denunciation of the federal budget plan proposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was swift and spirited. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the plan, called "The Path to Prosperity," as a "path to poverty." Another House Democrat, Chris Van Hollen, bashed it as a "rigid ideological agenda on steroids." Ryan’s 10-year plan has plenty to get worked up about. It would slash spending and deficits by the trillions, repeal the health care reform law enacted under President Barack Obama, and take aim at two mainstays Ryan and others say are headed for bankruptcy: Medicaid and Medicare. Seeking to mobilize opposition to the proposal, MoveOn.org seized on the plan’s changes to Medicare, the government health insurance for people age 65 and over and for people under 65 with certain disabilities. On April 6, 2011, the day after Ryan’s plan was released, the left-leaning political advocacy group sent an e-mail to its members. The e-mail began with this assertion: "Here's the most important thing you need to know about the Republicans' new budget plan: It abolishes Medicare within 10 years." We wondered: Would Medicare, a 46-year-old program that just seven years ago was expanded under Republican President George W. Bush, really disappear? As backup for its claim, MoveOn.org cited in the email a New York Times article that said the Republican budget plan would eventually privatize Medicare. But the article said nothing about abolishing Medicare, so we asked MoveOn.org if it had any other evidence. The group cited this sentence from the GOP plan: "Starting in 2022, new Medicare beneficiaries will be enrolled in the same kind of health care program that members of Congress enjoy." That sentence speaks of how new Medicare beneficiaries in 2022 will be treated, so it doesn’t support the MoveOn.org claim that Medicare will be abolished. But let’s dig in a little to get an understanding of what the House Republicans propose for Medicare. As it exists now, Medicare helps pay for doctor visits, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Under the GOP plan, people who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. People who turn 65 after 2022, the CBO analysis said, would get a "premium support payment" from Medicare. They would use that money toward the cost of buying private health insurance. One result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients "would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." Bottom line: Medicare would stay the same for people who turn 65 before 2022, but change -- significantly -- after that. We checked with a variety of experts on the question of Medicare being abolished in 10 years. They included two academics -- University of Minnesota health care finance professor Stephen Parente and health care economics professor Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University; two liberal organizations -- the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Families USA, which says it advocates for "high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans"; and two think tanks, the conservative Heritage Foundation and the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. None of the six argued the House Republican plan "abolishes" Medicare. Families USA framed it more cautiously, saying the proposal would "end Medicare as we know it by 2022." What does the Truth-O-Meter say? MoveOn.org claimed that Ryan’s budget plan "abolishes Medicare within 10 years." The group provided no evidence that backs the claim. To be sure, the plan would change Medicare, significantly, starting in 2022. But for those who turn 65 before then, there would be no changes at all, even after 2022. And for the others, Medicare would change -- dramatically -- but it would still exist. MoveOn.org went too far with its claim. We rate it False.

pomt-02184	"A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/27/alicia-menendez/menendez-white-family-likely-have-6-times-much-wea/	ABC’s This Week spent much of their show Sunday discussing race issues, from affirmative action to racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to economic disparity. During a roundtable segment on the difference between the middle class in the United States and Canada, Fusion reporter Alicia Menendez argued that differences in wealth aren’t just generational, they’re racial. "We also know that there is a racial component to this, that a white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession," she said. PunditFact finds her ratio correct. Menendez pointed us to an April 2013 report from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy think-tank. The institute measured mean wealth by race. Using 2010 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Urban Institute looked at assets including cash savings, homes, retirement accounts and subtracted any debt. The Urban Institute concluded that, post-recession, for every $1 an average black or Hispanic person has in wealth, an average white person has $6. That’s up from 1983, the farthest back the study goes, when the ratio was 5-to-1. Thomas Shapiro, a Brandeis University social policy professor who studies the wage gap, said the 6-to-1 ratio is correct, but represents the lower end of the wealth gap range researchers have come up with. At the higher end of the spectrum, Pew Research cited a 20-to-1 ratio in 2011. They took median wealth from the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation 2009 data. So the data varies by survey used, year and measure of average (mean vs median). There’s debate among economists and social scientists about which ratio is the most accurate. Darrick Hamilton, an urban policy professor at The New School, said the Census Bureau surveys more low-income families, while the Survey of Consumer Finances oversamples high-income families where minorities aren’t as well represented. Overall, any ratio from 6-to-1 to 22-to-1 could be considered an accurate measure of the wealth gap, Shapiro told us. Our ruling Menendez said, "A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession." A study from the Urban Institute supports her statistic. Other research shows an even wider gap, further proving her point that race is a factor in U.S. wealth. Menendez's statement is accurate, and might even understate the issue. We rate her claim True.	None	Alicia Menendez	None	None	None	2014-04-27T16:02:20	2014-04-27	['None']

pomt-04171	Says budget savings by reducing pay and benefits for federal employees total $103 billion over 10 years -- more than $50,000 per worker.	true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/17/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-cuts-pay-and-pensions-will-cost-fed/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is concerned that federal employees will be viewed as sacrificial lambs in negotiations to cut deficits and avoid the end-of-the-year fiscal cliff. So he wrote a letter reminding President Barack Obama of a number of steps Congress and the White House already have taken to save money at the expense of U.S. government workers. The Nov. 21 missive was signed by a bipartisan group of nine House members from Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia who represent large numbers of federal employees. Moran wrote, "Since the beginning of 2011, through various legislative and administration actions, the budget savings derived from reduced compensation and benefits for the federal workforce has totaled at least $103 billion (or more than $50,000 per employee), as measured over the 10 year budget window." We wondered his figures on compensation and benefits cuts for federal employees -- at least $103 billion over 10 years, more than $50,000 per worker -- hold up. Anne Hughes, Moran’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a variety of White House and congressional documents that she said back up her boss. Moran’s estimate of $103 billion in compensation and benefits cuts is based on three actions: *Congress canceled 1.4 percent cost-of living raises scheduled for all federal civilian employees in 2011 and 2012. The White House, which proposed the pay freeze, estimated it would save $60 billion over 10 years. *Obama has asked for a 0.5 percent pay raise for federal employees in 2013, but Congress is not expected to put the increase into effect before April, when it needs to approve a new continuing resolution to fund government. Congress, on the other hand, has approved a 1.7 percent raise for the military that would go into effect Jan. 1. Prior to the recession, Congress typically approved equal raises for federal workers and the military. The White House estimates the smaller pay hike for bureaucrats would save $28 billion over 10 years. *Pension contributions made by new federal employees will be increased as a result of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. Starting Jan. 1, new workers will have to contribute 2.3 percent of their pay to retirement while other federal bureaucrats will continue to pay 0.8 percent. The Senate Finance Committee and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate that the increase for new employees will save the government $15.5 billion over 11 years -- not the 10 years mentioned in Moran’s letter. These three actions add up to $103.5 billion -- almost exactly the number Moran cited. But do they break down to "more than $50,000" per federal worker, as the congressman claimed? Not quite. The number of full time, federal civilian employees has held steady at 2.1 million since 2010, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management that Moran used and to White House figures. So the lost wages and benefits comes to about $49,047 per worker. We should note that the White House estimates the U.S. spent $242 billion in salaries and benefits for executive branch employees, not including the military, during fiscal 2012, which ended Sept. 30. That amounts to 6.4 percent of the $3.8 trillion in federal spending during the budget year. Our ruling Moran wrote that Congress and the White House has saved $103 billion over 10 years by cutting pay raises and benefits for non-military federal employees. That breaks down to more than $50,000 per worker, he wrote. Moran is right about the $103 billion total cost. The discrepancies in other numbers he uses are insignificant. We rate his statement True.

pomt-14251	"In Malaysia … many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/12/bernie-sanders/sanders-right-migrant-laborers-malaysia-are-forced/	Bernie Sanders lines up fairly close to Donald Trump when it comes to the topic of trade. To some, that means Sanders has some explaining to do. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Sanders attempted to detail his position. It’s about a fundamental inequity in labor standards, Sanders suggested, enabling human rights abuses at the cost of American jobs. "I do believe in trade. But it has to be based on principles that are fair," Sanders said. "So if you are in Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 65¢ an hour, or you're in Malaysia, where many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions, no, I'm not going to have American workers ‘competing’ against you under those conditions." Sanders has made trade a big topic on the campaign trail — highlighting Hillary Clinton’s comments and votes in favor of trade deals. (PolitiFact has documented a lengthy comparison of the two.) Here, we wanted to fact-check Sanders’ claim that workers in Malaysia — which would be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — are forced into working under "slave-like conditions." In a word, yes. Not only is forced labor widely documented by labor and human rights groups, it’s openly acknowledged by the U.S. government. From cell phones to sneakers to palm oil The Sanders campaign referred us to a 2014 report from Verité, an NGO that monitors labor standard compliance. Verité interviewed 501 workers in Malaysia’s electronics industry (the country’s leading sector), and found that 28 percent of them were coerced under both global standards and Malaysian law. "This work has led us to conclude that forced labour in this industry is systemic and that every company operating in this sector in Malaysia faces a high risk of forced labour in their operations," Dan Viederman, chief executive of Verité, told the Guardian in 2014. The International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, defines forced labor using four dimensions: unfree recruitment, work and life duress, impossibility of leaving an employer and penalty or menace of penalty. The Malaysian electronics industry violated all these guidelines in some capacity. Like the indentured servants who came to America in the 18th century, the vast majority of foreign workers — largely from other parts of Southeast Asia — were charged excessive job-finding fees and had to take on debt to pay them off, effectively tethering them to the job (unfree recruitment). One in five workers were also deceived about their wages or other employment conditions, and one in three lived in and often confined to crowded, unsafe housing provided by their employer or recruitment agency (work and life durres). Verité also found that 94 percent of workers had their passports withheld by the factory or agent (penalty), though the practice is prohibited by local labor laws . Fifty-seven percent said they couldn’t leave their jobs out of fear of getting slapped with high fines, losing their passport, being reported to the authorities or other forms of retribution (impossibility of leaving an employer). But forced labor is by no means limited to one sector. Malaysia has the fourth-largest migrant worker population in the world, and its 3 million to 6 million foreign workers "all are vulnerable to exploitation in a variety of industries," said Abby McGill, the campaigns director for the International Labor Rights Forum. The State Department notes that passport confiscation was "widespread and generally unpunished," and has placed Malaysia in its Tier 3 watch list for human trafficking — the rating reserved for the worst offenders — in 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2014. In addition to electronics, the U.S. Labor Department currently lists the garments and palm oil industries where labor abuses occurs (palm oil is also cited for child labor). Human Rights Watch reported on exploited migrant domestic workers in 2011. Amnesty International chronicled the stories of trafficked, trapped and physically and sexually abused workers in a variety of industries from agriculture to construction in 2010. "They buy and sell us like cattle," a 25-year-old Bangladeshi working for a palm oil producer whose customers includes U.S. agricultural giant Cargill told the Wall Street Journal in 2015. Free trade and chained work The debate over whether free trade stymies, improves or has no bearing at all on working conditions is an ongoing one. International labor standards are actually included in many trade agreements.The United States monitors worker conditions in partner countries, and has spent $275 million to support labor rights since 2001, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office audit. But despite this, the GAO concluded that there’s still a lot of room for improvement. The USTR and Labor Department "lack a strategic approach to systematically assess whether partner countries’ conditions and practices are inconsistent with labor provisions in (free trade agreements)," according to the audit. Academics have also pointed out these provisions are often ambiguous, difficult to enforce or simply ignored. In other words, agreements on paper don’t necessarily translate to improved conditions in real life. Malaysia is actually a prime example of labor rights possibly taking a backseat to free trade. In 2015, it was upgraded to Tier 2 for human trafficking by the State Department over the objections of its own human rights experts. Many perceived the move to be politically motivated, as the improved rating made the country eligible to join the TPP. Because of Malaysia’s poor labor record, it also signed a bilateral agreement with the United States, promising to implement workers rights and protect against forced labor before obtaining trade benefits. Human rights and labor rights groups, however, are skeptical this will lead to actual reform. "The devil is in the details of actual implementation, and Malaysia is a very corrupt place where those with connections and money can get away with not complying with the law – as both Malaysian and migrant workers have found out frequently over the past two decades," said Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Asia at Human Rights Watch. Said McGill of the International Labor Rights Forum: "Given that they get everything they want upfront whether they change anything or not (not an ideal negotiating strategy), the labor enforcement provisions are so weak there isn't a stick to force them to comply. That approach has never worked in the history of free trade agreements. No reason to think it will start now." Nonetheless, many have argued you can have your free trade and be humane, too. A 2010 study, for example, found that labor conditions have improved in Cambodia as a result of labor provisions in a trade agreement signed with the United States. But many argue that improved working conditions are actually a cascading effect of global trade, not regulation itself. "The kinds of adjustments that go with free trade, while painful in the short run, lead to improved labor conditions in the long run," Stanford labor economist Robert Flanagan said in an interview about his book, Globalization and Labor Conditions. Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, acknowledged that some are certainly worse off as a result of global trade. He pointed out that working conditions were terrible in the United States a century ago, but improved when the economy developed and standard of living rose. "Do we really think it would a good idea for the U.S. not to have been able to trade in 1916 or 1886?" Burtless said. "It is very hard to think of anything that has delivered a bigger improvement in the lives of poor workers than expanding their ability to sell to other countries. Period. End of story. To pretend otherwise, that you’re going to protect their workers by keeping their products out of our country, flips on its head policies most conducive to improving their lives." Our ruling Sanders said, "In Malaysia … many of the workers are indentured servants because their passports are taken away when they come into this country and are working in slave-like conditions." Forced migrant labor and passport withholding is widely documented across Malaysia by human rights and labor groups. The United States acknowledged the abuses in several government reports and databases. While there is a debate about whether free trade can help curtail these abuses, there is no debate to the veracity of Sanders’ claim. We rate it True.

pomt-11257	"CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/01/daily-world-update/fake-story-says-cnn-fired-journalist-making-fun-tr/	An online hoax smashed together a 2015 comment by Donald Trump and a comedian’s roast of the Trump administration to make up a story about CNN. "CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face," said an April 29 headline by Daily World Update. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. On April 28, comedian Michelle Wolf hosted the annual White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner in which she made fun of press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Part of Wolf’s remarks were interpreted as a jab at Sanders’ appearance; she indirectly referred to her as a softball coach dividing the press corps into teams, and that Sanders "burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye." Trump, as well as some members of the press association, criticized Wolf’s remarks. The Daily World Update wrote that Marvin Schmidt, a supposed former CNN co-host, was fired after he defended Wolf’s remarks. "Look at that face," Schmidt said in an alleged now-deleted tweet, The Daily World Update wrote. "I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things but really folks, come on! Are we serious?" That quote was actually made by Trump in a Rolling Stone interview in 2015 when speaking about GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina. "Look at that face!" he cries. "Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!" The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. "I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?" CNN has no co-host named Marvin Schmidt, a CNN spokeswoman Barbara Levin told PolitiFact. She said the story was fabricated. The Daily World Update story includes a photo of three people on CNN, including a black man in the middle with a red circle drawn around his face suggesting that he was the alleged Schmidt who was fired. We searched for the photo in Google Images and found that it matched a panel of guests on CNN in February 2016 about the reaction to Beyonce’s album Formation. The black man on the panel was Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and a former South Carolina state representative. Sellers told PolitiFact that he hasn’t spoken on CNN about Wolf’s speech to the White House Correspondents Association. The Daily World Update describes itself as satire. But this story hardly meets that definition. The website is linked to a frequent purveyor of such hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. The post Facebook users see would give little clue to the fact that the story is made up. Our ruling The Daily World Update wrote that "CNN shocks America, fires ‘journalist’ who made fun of Sarah Sanders’ face." The story said that Marvin Schmidt was fired by CNN, but there is no co-host at CNN by that name. The story said Schmidt tweeted an insult about Sanders’ appearance, but the actual quote came from Trump in 2015 about Carly Fiorina. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-02223	Dan Patrick "changed his name from Danny Goeb to hide from" his "debts."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/apr/18/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-lofts-ridiculous-unsupported-claim-/	Dan Patrick of Houston walked away from hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and, according to his opponent in a May 27, 2014, Republican lieutenant governor primary runoff, "changed his name from Danny Goeb to hide from the debts." "If he can’t run his own business honestly," a woman says in the ad launched Aprl 16, 2014, by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, "how can we ever trust him to run the state honestly?" Patrick’s past bankruptcy and name change have drawn news coverage before. We wanted to look into the charge that Patrick, a state senator since 2007, changed his name in connection with his financial difficulties, something we hadn't heard before. That may be because it's not factually supported. We asked for evidence to support the claim from the Dewhurst campaign and received none. To our inquiry, the Dallas Morning News emailed us excerpts from Patrick’s bankruptcy case. The provided 10 pages show Patrick’s bankruptcy filing was initiated Oct. 27, 1986, and was closed Oct. 22, 1992. Also, a document indicates, Patrick (whose legal name was then Goeb) was "released from all dischargeable debts" on May 4, 1987. News stories dating to Patrick’s first Senate campaign, in 2006, indicate he legally changed his name years after his bankruptcy filing and after he’d presented himself as Dan Patrick for decades in his careers as a TV broadcaster, businessman and conservative talk-radio host. An Oct. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story said: "Dan Patrick is the stage name the former Dannie Scott Goeb took when he went into broadcasting, even before he moved to Houston in 1979 to be an anchor with KHOU." A March 1, 2006, Houston Chronicle news story said: "Born Dannie Scott Goeb in Baltimore, he began using the more familiar name," Dan Patrick, "in 1978 as a sportscaster in Scranton, Pa. He legally changed his name in the fall of 2003 while contemplating a political run, so he would be recognizable on the ballot," the story said. So, Patrick used his professional name long before the bankruptcy. He legally changed his name more than 15 years after filing for personal bankruptcy. Patrick describes his name change on a campaign web page, saying his birth name, with Goeb pronounced like globe, "was not a pleasant sounding name or easy to spell if you didn’t see it. I have never used it on air. Beginning with my first radio job at age 18 back in 1968 I used my first and middle name only. I was Dan Scott on the radio and planned on keeping that as my on air name always. "However, Elden Hale, the man who hired me for my first TV anchor job in 1977 told me I needed to change my air name before joining his station in Scranton, Pa. He asked me to pick a new name because there was an anchor with the last name of Scott on a competing station. He didn’t want any confusion. I was so excited to finally get my first anchor job in television whatever he wanted me to do in that regard was fine with me. "My wife and I picked Dan Patrick. Her brother’s middle name was Patrick. I have been known as Dan Patrick for 36 years. My parents even became known as the Patricks. Even though our legal name was Goeb all those years my wife and children were known as the Patricks by most folks." In the post, Patrick went on to say he legally changed his name to Dan Goeb Patrick so he could present himself as Dan Patrick in any possible bid for elected office. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick changed his name to hide from his debts. The lieutenant governor offered no backup for this claim, which shakes out as factually illogical. Patrick’s bankruptcy case ended in 1992; he has said he legally changed his name 11 years later. That gap in time alone leads us to see this claim as both incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05226	"Right now, I’m polling at about 8 percent" against Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-tells-jon-stewart-he-has-8-percent-su/	During the June 5, 2012, edition of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico now running for president as a Libertarian, discussed how much support he needs to secure a spot on the debate stage this fall. "How do you get onto the debate? How can you become like Ross Perot did and get included in the national debate?" Stewart asked, referring to the third-party candidate who was invited to the 1992 presidential debates with President George H.W. Bush and his Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton. Johnson responded, "The notion here is to actually win the race. I mean, that’s the pie-in-the-sky notion. To do that, I have to poll at 15 percent to get on the national debate stage with Obama and Romney. Right now, I’m polling at about 8 percent against the two of them. … The biggest ingredient in my being at 8 percent is the fact that I’m the third name being listed, not so much me." We wondered whether Johnson is really pulling down 8 percent support. (After all, he never broke 1 percent in a Republican primary.) We first turned to the presidential polling archive at RealClearPolitics.com. We found nearly three dozen nationwide presidential polls taken since the beginning of April, but only one of them specifically offered Johnson’s name along with Obama and Romney during its interviews. That poll was taken by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm. PPP uses automated calls, a method that has historically been considered inferior to live interviewers. But polling experts have found its results in recent years to be credible. The PPP poll, taken April 12-15 with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, found support for Johnson at 6 percent. An earlier PPP poll, taken March 15-17 with an equivalent margin of error, found Johnson’s support at 7 percent. These are the only two national polls we found that included Johnson among the candidate options. (We asked the Johnson campaign for any other public polls that offered his name, but we did not hear back.) The other polls in the RealClearPolitics database offered only the names of Obama and Romney. Anyone responding to these polls who said they supported the former New Mexico governor would have seen their response categorized under "other (volunteered)." And "other" typically ended up below 6 percent or 7 percent. Here is the level of "other" support in a few recent polls: • CNN/ORC, May 29-31, 2012: 1 percent • ABC News-Washington Post, May 17 to 20, 2012: 1 percent • Fox News, May 13 to 15, 2012: 3 percent PPP director Tom Jensen said he thought the results in his poll exaggerated Johnson's real standing and predicted he won't sustain that level into the fall. "It’s common for third-party candidates to poll higher months out from the election date," he said. "Eventually folks decide to vote for a candidate with a serious chance of winning." Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. "Polls outside New Mexico and perhaps a few other states are unlikely to be showing Johnson strength," Bowman said. "They are much more likely to be showing dissatisfaction with Obama and Romney." It’s worth noting that Johnson acknowledged this point in the Daily Show interview when he said that "the biggest ingredient in my being at 8 percent is the fact that I’m the third name being listed, not so much me." Bowman is correct that some state polls have shown higher levels of support for Johnson than national polls have. PPP polls have shown Johnson at 15 percent in his home state of New Mexico, 9 percent in Arizona, 8 percent in Montana and 7 percent in New Hampshire. A poll conducted by ORC International for the libertarian magazine Reason found Johnson taking 6 percent in Wisconsin. However, we aren’t factoring single-state polls into our rating, because Stewart and Johnson were discussing the threshold for securing a place in the debates -- something that can only be achieved through national polls. Officially, this requires that the candidate "have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations, using the average of those organizations' most recent publicly-reported results at the time of the determination." Our rating Johnson said that "right now, I’m polling at about 8 percent" against Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Two national PPP polls show Johnson topping out at 7 percent, which is close to 8 percent. Still, Johnson’s claim has plenty of holes. He said "right now," yet the most recent PPP national poll was taken in April, nearly two months ago. Also, viewers probably got the impression Johnson has consistently polled at that level in many polls. But the vast majority have not offered Johnson’s name to respondents; the percentage of respondents volunteering "other," a measurement that may be seen as a rough approximation of Johnson’s core support, has ranged between 1 percent and 3 percent in these polls. Finally, experts say they believe Johnson’s showing in the PPP poll exaggerated his level of support. On balance, we rate Johnson’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-06584	"We have asked public employees to pay 10 percent of the costs of their guaranteed pension and 15 percent of the cost of their health care. ... The leadership of those public employees unions don't want to pay anything."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/27/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-leadership-public-unions-unwi/	In a recent appearance on the morning show "Fox & Friends, Gov. John Kasich’s focus was on finances, a month after Standard & Poor's upgraded Ohio's credit outlook from negative to stable. The governor touted his accomplishments and philosophy to host Steve Doocy. Then Kasich mentioned the referendum battle over Senate Bill 5, the law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio’s public unions. (If Issue 2 passes on the November ballot, the law takes effect. If voters reject the issue, SB 5 is repealed.) "We have asked public employees to pay 10 percent of the costs of their guaranteed pension and 15 percent of the cost of their health care," Kasich said. "Almost everyone in Ohio has sacrificed. The leadership of those public employees unions don't want to pay anything." PolitiFact Ohio knew that SB 5, among its many provisions, requires public employees to pay at least 15 percent of their health-insurance premiums, and that it prohibits local governments from picking up any portion of an employee's share of his pension contributions. But we thought it’d be good to check into the governor's assertion that "the leadership of those public employees unions don't want to pay anything" toward health care or pensions. Not any? Not anything? We called Kasich's office for explanation. Spokesman Rob Nichols quickly provided background on the state's collective bargaining agreements. He also referred us to the continuing budget and labor struggles in Toledo. First, some background. Many public workers contribute 10 percent of their salary toward their pension while the employer contributes 14 percent. Some unions, however, have negotiated deals where the employer pays a portion of the employee contribution, a practice known as a "pension pickup." If an employer agreed to pay 2 percent of the worker share, for example, it would pay 16 percent of the worker’s salary and the worker would pay 8 percent. That practice is prohibited by SB 5. In Toledo, Mayor Mike Bell took office last year facing a $48 million deficit. Deputy Mayor for Operations Steve Herwat told us that the administration tried to balance it through expenditure reductions, revenue increases and contract concessions. Negotiated agreements called for the city to pick up the full 10 percent employee's pension contribution. Five of the city's six unions agreed to concessions, in which employees would pay a portion of their pension share, after Bell asked Toledo City Council to declare "exigent circumstances" that essentially declared a fiscal emergency. One unit, the Toledo Police Command Officers Association, representing about 120 sergeants, lieutenants and captains, rejected the concession and has stood fast -- preferring, as Kasich said, not to pay anything. The dispute has continued. In September, local members of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, which represents about 850 non-uniformed Toledo workers, rejected an independent fact finder's report proposing that they pay the full 10 percent share of their pension contributions. (They said the average union member makes $38,000 a year and would lose about $6,000 in take-home pay.) We looked further and found Toledo was not unique. In Columbus, the Dispatch has reported, city government pays more than 80 percent of the employee pension share, "a benefit unduplicated elsewhere in Ohio on such a large scale," and pays the entire share for almost two-thirds of city workers. But the story is different for workers for Franklin County, of which Columbus is the county seat. Almost 90 percent of Franklin County workers pay their own entire pension share, the Dispatch found. Columbus schools pick up the superintendent's pension contribution, but not those of teachers and staff members. According to figures from the Ohio Legislative Service Commission, about 2,500 local government employers -- less than half of the roughly 5,600 units of government -- pay part or all of their employees' contributions into the retirement system, and organized workers are covered by 3,290 collective bargaining contracts. The Dayton Daily News, citing the state's five public pension systems, reported recently that about 6.6 percent of public employees have union and individual contracts that call for the employer to pick up all or part of the workers’ share. As in the case of the Columbus schools superintendent, those employees are not all union workers. State government pays only what is required and does not provide pension pickup. A report on pension reform last year by the Budget Advisory Task Force of the Ohio Society of CPAs, which recommended phasing out pickups, said the practice "may not be widespread." One of PolitiFact Ohio’s basic tenets is that words matter. If Kasich had qualified his statement, he would have been on firmer ground. It is true that some public workers in Ohio receive a full or partial pension pickup. And it is true that at least two bargaining units have so far rejected concessions that would have employees paying all or part of their pension contribution share. But saying that "the leadership of those public employees unions don't want to pay anything," after an unqualified statement about public employees in general, creates the impression that that union leaders dealing with nearly 3,300 collective bargaining contracts have broadly rejected the idea of paying anything toward the employee's pension contribution. Because the governor's statement does contain some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10486	Democrats' budget resolution would raise America's tax bill by "$500-billion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/14/john-mccain/the-budget-resolution-isnt-that-clear/	With so much time between primaries, political junkies have to take their fun where they can find it. Thankfully, Sen. John McCain's campaign Web site has come up with an interactive widget — it describes it as a poll — that asks online visitors to guess how much "the Democrats' budget resolution (would) raise America's tax bill." Never mind that most Americans have probably never heard of a "budget resolution," the annual document that lawmakers draw up to use as blueprints for future spending. McCain is seeking to fortify his own credentials as a fiscal conservative while also portraying the party of his rivals as reckless spenders. McCain's Web site gives visitors four choices with which to gauge Democratic profligacy: zero, $500-million, $200-billion or $500-billion. Pick any one, click the "submit" bar at the bottom, and a screen appears advising the responder that the correct answer is $500-billion. It also asks visitors to sign an online petition "to support a restoring fiscal sanity" (sic) by giving their names, e-mail addresses and zip codes. McCain might be making himself out to be a voice of fiscal sanity, but even casual budget wonks will find the poll misleading. First, budget resolutions don't have the force of law; the majority party uses them both to make a political statement and to set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law. So, what about the $500-billion figure? This also is misleading, because the fiscal 2009 budget resolutions the House and Senate adopted in March don't have line items on tax proposals. The Democrats who wrote them assume that many of President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire at the end of 2010 — a development that would bring more revenue into the government's coffers and perhaps help the Democrats make good on their pledge to balance the budget by 2012. We asked the McCain campaign where they got the $500-billion figure and they did not respond. But it's the same amount that other Republicans have used, noting that it's the difference between revenue calculations done with the tax cuts expiring and with the tax cuts being extended. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, did five-year revenue projections that assumed all of the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire, and those revenue estimates are close to what the budget resolutions project for the same time frame. This is what Republicans use as evidence that Democrats want to eliminate all of those tax cuts. We see the logic, but other facts need to be taken into account. Those same Democratic lawmakers who wrote the budget resolution also support extending at least some of the tax cuts that have helped lower- and middle-income taxpayers. In fact, during the full Senate debate on the chamber's resolution, lawmakers adopted an amendment by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., that would extend the child tax credit, marriage-penalty relief provisions and other components in the 2001 tax package. Democrats say they haven't yet made final decisions on which tax cuts will stay and which will go, and they maintain those tax cuts that are extended will be offset by tax increases elsewhere or by spending cuts. In other words, the budget resolution doesn't provide enough specifics to know the net effect on taxes, up or down. It's all part of the dodgy nature of budget politics, but the fact remains that budget resolutions do not contain enough specific language for anyone to calculate a particular tax increase. For McCain to claim it's $500-billion is False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-04-14T00:00:00	2008-04-07	['United_States', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-09634	"In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson ... got a $25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients in their state."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/23/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-health-care-bill-has-special-treat-/	The Nelsons are becoming whipping boys for Republicans upset with the Senate health care reform bill. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., is being targeted for a Medicaid provision in the bill that benefits only his state. ( Read our related item here .) And now Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., is being accused of tucking in a special gift for 800,000 Florida seniors. Sen. John McCain calls it the "Florida Flim Flam." Karl Rove prefers the "Sunshine State Sweepstakes." At issue in this case is Medicare Advantage, a program used by nearly 1 million Florida seniors. We'll let Rove, the former adviser to President George W. Bush who was talking on Fox News, explain the rest. "In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson -- no relation to Ben, except in his habits -- got a $25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients in their state," Rove said Tuesday. "Every Medicare Advantage policyholder in America, except those in Florida, will see a huge cut in the federal support for those policies, and as a result, a dramatic decline in their benefits and an increase in their premiums, except if you live in Florida." Rove, McCain and many Republicans are accusing Nelson of sticking a big, fat goody in the health care bill for the folks back home. And only the folks back home. Is that what's happening? First, a short lesson on what we're talking about, Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is an optional program that lets Medicare recipients 65 and older receive their benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the traditional Medicare program. The idea behind the program was to save the government money, but it hasn't worked out that way. Under the program, the government pays Advantage companies a set amount per enrollee, about $10,000, and they make a profit if they keep average costs below that level. The reimbursement amounts to about 14 percent more, on average, than the government spends on a traditional Medicare beneficiary. The extra money allows companies to offer Medicare Advantage members additional services, such as prescription drug, vision and dental coverage at a much lower cost, as well as other perks like gym memberships. About 11 million people are enrolled in the program nationwide. To help pay for changes to the health care system, Democrats are considering deep cuts to Medicare Advantage reimbursements, about $120 billion spread between now and 2019. That proposal has most Republicans, and in this case the Democrat Nelson, nervous. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin picks it up from here. Nelson opposes Medicare Advantage, and voted against it -- believing it costs too much, McLaughlin said. But in the current debate Nelson was hesitant to strip benefits from seniors who already had them. He asked for the 11 million seniors currently enrolled in Medicare Advantage to be grandfathered into the new system under the old rules. At a cost of $35 billion, Nelson was told that was too expensive. Instead, Senate leaders offered Nelson $5 billion to help protect current Medicare Advantage recipients, McLaughlin said. So Nelson added a provision to the bill that protects seniors most affected by the proposed cuts or changes. Specifically, the money targets communities and areas where the cost of service is highest and allows those people to use the old rules. McLaughlin equates it to a cost-of-living adjustment. The language in the health care bill, which begins on Page 894, never mentions Florida or any specific state. Rather it creates a difficult-to-follow formula to determine just who should be protected from the changes. We should note that Nelson's provision wasn't a last-minute addition to secure his support on the larger bill. The Medicare Advantage exemption was included in the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee in October. We'll also note that the Senate Finance Committee widened the pool of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries protected from the new rules. The total additional cost is expected to be around $7.5 billion over 10 years, McLaughlin said. Independent analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation say the protections will cost around $5 billion between 2012 and 2019. So who benefits? Floridians for sure. "Florida will definitely be treated more generously than most other states," said John Rother, executive vice president for policy and strategy for AARP. But not just Floridians. Of the 1 million or so Floridians participating in Medicare Advantage, about 800,000 are expected to be protected from possible cuts. But so are people living in New York and Los Angeles, as well as in Oregon, McLaughlin says. A spokesman for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., confirmed that New Jersey seniors also will benefit from Nelson's protections to Medicare Advantage. And Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said this: "We got a special protection worth billions of dollars to stop Medicare cuts for 800,000 New York seniors." Menendez said a total of five states would receive protections. To be honest, we're not sure how many states or people will be protected since senators and their staff are using different numbers and estimates. We'll update this item when we find out. But what we do know is this: Nelson's provision in the health care bill will protect some seniors in Florida and others in Oregon, New York, New Jersey and California. A chief critic of the provision, McCain, and the independent Kaiser Family Foundation, both say it will cost about $5 billion. McLaughlin, Nelson's aide, puts the total at about $7.5 billion. That flies in the face of Rove's statement on Fox News, "In Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson ... got a $25 billion to $30 billion carve-out for Medicare Advantage patients in their state." ( UPDATE: After our story published, Rove penned a column for the Wall Street Journal that put the dollar figure at a revised $3.5 billion.) Though Florida may see the lion's share of the benefit, Florida isn't specifically carved out of any potential Medicare Advantage cuts. The current Senate legislation includes a complicated formula designed to protect seniors most at risk of big cutbacks. We rate Rove's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13126	"In two terms in the Missouri General Assembly, Jason Kander passed ZERO bills that were signed into law."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/03/one-nation-pac/pac-oversimplifies-kanders-time-general-assembly/	In a recent mailer sent to Missouri voters, One Nation, a conservative political action committee, criticized Democrat Jason Kander for not passing any legislation during his two terms as a representative in the Missouri General Assembly. Kander, the current Missouri Secretary of State, is challenging incumbent U.S. Senator Roy Blunt for a seat on Capitol Hill. The front of the mailer is blank, except for the words, "This page is dedicated to all the laws Jason Kander passed in the Missouri General Assembly." The back, featuring a photograph of Kander with his hands up, has "ZERO" printed in all capital letters. For such a dramatic advertisement, we figured it was a claim worth checking. Our only method of contacting One Nation was via Twitter. The group’s website lists no phone number or email address. We received no response. But, as the mailer states, Kander’s legislation record can easily be found in the Missouri House of Representatives archives. Kander’s time in the House The mailer goes on to make the case that Kander "has run for three different offices in just eight years, instead of concentrating on the job he was elected to do." Kander has in fact run for three different offices in the past eight years. He served two terms in the House, but could not run again because of term limits. After his time in the House, Kander was elected secretary of state in 2012, and announced his bid for U.S. Senate in February 2015. But what did Kander do during his time in the General Assembly? Kander served as a state representative from 2009 to 2012, and was a member of six different committees, including the budget committee. During both of his terms, the House was controlled by Republicans, making it difficult for Democrat-backed bills to make it out of committees and onto the floor. In fact, of the 28 bills Kander sponsored as a representative, only two passed in the House — House Bill 504 in 2009 and House Bill 238 in 2011. Neither were signed into law. Kander co-sponsored seven bills that were eventually signed by the governor. "As a member of the minority in the State House, the most effective way to have an impact on legislation is through partnering with Republicans and working hard at the committee level," said Anne Feldman, press secretary for Kander’s campaign. Kander focused much of his time in the House pushing for ethics reform. In 2010, he and Rep. Tim Flook, R-Liberty, passed a major ethics reform bill through the House — the first passed in Missouri since 1991. The bill made it through the Senate and was signed by Gov. Jay Nixon. However, in 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court struck down the bill, saying it was unconstitutional because the ethics provisions were tacked onto a bill dealing with purchasing provisions, two unrelated matters. Sponsorship versus co-sponsor The difference between sponsorship and co-sponsorship really depends on the bill. A bill’s sponsor is the representative who actually brings the bill to the floor. "Usually, though not always, sponsors put a lot more effort into researching, drafting, and pushing through a bill," MU political science professor Marvin Overby said. Bills are either crafted by a sponsor and that legislator’s staff, or brought to sponsors by lobbyists or special interest groups. Bills can only have one sponsor, but can have an unlimited number of co-sponsors. A co-sponsor’s involvement in the lawmaking process can vary. For example, in passing the ethics reform bill, Kander partnered directly with Flook to craft the bill, showing as much involvement as a sponsor. On the other hand, lawmakers can co-sponsor bills "as a cheap way of position-taking," Overby said. This is more common with non-original co-sponsors, when lawmakers sign onto a bill after it’s already been brought to the floor. Not an effective measure Measuring a lawmaker’s success by the number of sponsored bills they passed is pretty inaccurate in the long run. The percentage of bills passed is more telling than number, Overby said. "More effective legislators usually concentrate more, putting effort into passing a few bills, rather than introducing a lot that have little chance of passage," he said. Being a Democrat in a Republican-controlled General Assembly didn’t make passing bills any easier for Kander. "In majoritarian institutions, especially those with super-majorities like the Missouri legislature, it is very difficult to get minority-sponsored bills passed," Overby said. "Bill passage rates is much more relevant for members of the majority." Our ruling One Nation's mailer is misleading and cherry-picks Kander’s record. While none of his directly sponsored bills made it past the House floor, he was an active co-sponsor for ethics reform, and managed to get his bill through the Senate and to the governor’s office. While Kander co-sponsored seven bills that became law, no bill he directly sponsored was signed by the governor. But the statement ignores key facts to paint an incomplete picture.

pomt-12000	"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/24/donald-trump/trumps-mostly-false-claim-nfl-ratings-are-way-down/	President Donald Trump blamed low National Football League ratings and attendance on unpatriotic players. "NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.," Trump tweeted on Sept. 24, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com His Sunday morning tweet referred to NFL players -- most notably former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- who kneel during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality. Trump had made a similar claim during a campaign rally on the Friday before for Sen. Luther Strange in Huntsville, Ala. Trump also urged the NFL fire or suspend those players. "If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!" Trump tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We wanted to know if ratings or attendance of NFL games were indeed "way down." We previously rated a similar claim Trump made about CNN’s ratings Pants on Fire. Once again, Trump seems to be overstating rating declines, and we found little evidence of their political motivation. By the numbers We’ll begin by saying that the numbers for 2017 so far are inconclusive. Advertising Age media reporter Anthony Crupi told us he estimated a decline of around 9 percent in ratings since last year, although the only window to face a significant decline was the 1 p.m. regional games. But we only have full data for the first two weeks of the season — the first of which was likely impacted by Hurricane Irma — making the data set too small to draw any conclusions according to Paulsen, editor in chief of Sports Media Watch. (Paulsen’s professional name is simply Paulsen.) Average attendance for 2017 thus far is also down — by 5 percent, while gross attendance is off 8 percent from 2016. Trump might be referring to 2016, a year when the NFL saw a significant drop in viewership, although average game attendance increased by 3 percent from 2015 to 2016. According to ESPN, NFL game broadcasters saw an average year-on-year drop in television viewership last season of 8 percent. Fox saw the lowest ratings since 2008 and ESPN since 2005. But that excluded Thursday Night Football games, which Paulsen said likely would lower the percentage, and alternate viewing platforms. "A variety of factors made the comparison versus last year skewed, including streaming on Twitter and a new partner, NBC," ESPN reported. A new Nielsen study measuring audiences in bars, restaurants, gyms and other out-of-home venues showed that NFL viewership nearly matched 2015’s numbers. However, they didn’t compute out-of-home numbers for 2015, suggesting there might still be some discrepancy. It’s still a modest decline, according to Paulsen, because the NFL’s ratings are usually so strong — the NFL is the most popular televised sports event in the United States. He also pointed out that isolating the NFL made little sense. "I think it’s really important to note the NFL is not declining while other leagues are increasing," Paulsen said. "NASCAR ratings are in the cellar right now. The NBA had some of its lowest rated games ever on network television last year … It’s an industry-wide phenomenon and the NFL isn’t immune to it anymore." Why the drop? Trump spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to a Seton Hall Sports Poll that found that 56 percent of 841 respondents cited players not standing for the national anthem as a reason for last year’s ratings drop. But as CNBC pointed out, the poll asked why other people — rather than respondents — aren't watching football. About half the people polled said they either follow sports "not closely" or "not at all," but coverage of Kaepernick’s kneeling was widely covered by the media. A similar J.D. Power survey Cheung cited also reported national anthem protests as the main reason NFL fans watched less games last season. "Among the 12 percent who watch less (sports), 26 percent of them say national anthem protests are to blame, however those respondents reflect only 3 percent of the full, nationwide sample," the researchers wrote. Various pundits criticized the survey results as negligible, pointing out that for every one person turned off by protests, 10 NFL fans tuned in. "If a larger share of respondents claimed they watched more NFL, the fact that NFL ratings were actually down last year is good enough reason to discard this survey as meaningless," Patrick Redford wrote in Deadspin. Like the Seton Hall survey, the reasons for tuning out were offered as a list for respondents to choose from, so people weren’t necessarily offering the anthem protests on their own, and respondents could provide multiple answers. Paulsen said that NFL rating drops aren’t unprecedented, with similar declines in the ‘80s, ‘90s and the first half of the 2000s. "It’s only now that people are deciding it’s a political issue, that people are really focusing on it. There’s any number of reasons to believe that what’s happening right now is not necessarily political," Paulsen said, including a loss of interest among younger viewers. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said "NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country." Ratings were down 8 percent in 2016, but experts said the drop was modest and in line with general ratings for the sports industry. The NFL remains the most watched televised sports event in the United States. Ratings in 2017 so far suggest a similar year-on-year drop, but experts say it’s too early to tell, and external factors like Hurricane Irma, which coincided with the season’s first week, may help explain the drop. NFL game attendance dropped slightly from 2016 to 2017, and rose from 2015 to 2016. As for political motivation, there’s little evidence to suggest people are boycotting the NFL. Most of the professional sports franchises are dealing with declines in popularity. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14870	Says Marco Rubio is proposing a new $1 trillion "welfare program" in tax credits and "$1 trillion in new military spending."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/12/rand-paul/marco-rubio-not-conservative-proposes-1-trillion-b/	The word conservative was uttered 18 times during the Fox Business News Republican presidential debate on Nov. 10, 2015. The first 17 references made in the Milwaukee Theatre were done with particular emphasis by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich used the word once.) Paul called himself the only fiscal conservative among the eight candidates on stage -- and made a point to contrast himself with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, in one of the more contentious exchanges of the night. Rubio had just defended his proposal to increase a child tax credit when Paul interjected. "We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment," Paul said of Rubio’s tax credit plan. "So, here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments -- a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative." Defending the tax credit and his defense spending proposals, Rubio said "the family is the most important institution in society and "the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world." But is Rubio proposing a new $1 trillion "welfare program" and "$1 trillion in new military spending"? And $1 trillion over what period of time? Tax credit Rubio’s tax plan includes creating a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child. It is meant to offset income and payroll taxes and is considerably larger than the $1,000 credit that is currently available. Refundable tax credits help people at the lower end of the income scale, in that people who are too poor to pay any income tax can get money back from the government. Paul’s campaign referred us to a March 2015 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation of a tax plan proposed in the Senate by Rubio and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. That analysis estimated the credit would result in a loss of tax revenue of about $170 billion per year. That’s the equivalent of $1.7 trillion over 10 years -- 10 years being a common time frame for federal budget planning. But it’s worth noting that Paul didn’t say 10 years in making his claim. We’ll note that, unlike the original Rubio-Lee plan, Rubio as a candidate is proposing that the credit would be phased out at higher income levels -- beginning at $150,000 for an individual and $300,000 for a family. That would mean the lost revenue would be something less than $1.7 trillion over 10 years, but still well above $1 trillion, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank. That’s because relatively few people at the higher incomes have children and would be eligible for the tax credits, he told us. In other words, the tax credit is expensive, Pomerlau said, because "it’s large and nearly universal for families." The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, also did an estimate of the original tax credit proposal and came up with a figure similar to that of the Tax Foundation -- an estimated loss of nearly $1.58 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us the center hasn't analyzed Rubio's current proposal. But he said a loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years is a fair estimate. Paul’s characterization of Rubio’s tax credit as welfare is a stretch, however. Eleanor May, Paul’s campaign spokeswoman, said "giving people a refundable credit -- meaning, giving them more than they paid" is a "welfare transfer payment from one group of people to another." But as our colleagues at PunditFact noted, even the most expansive definition of welfare -- including the cash program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (formerly known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children), traditional food stamps, Medicaid and the food program called Women, Infants and Children -- doesn’t include tax credits. Rubio, whose campaign did not respond to our requests for this article, noted in the debate that everyone who works pays the payroll tax. Defense spending Rubio has backed more defense spending since at least March 2015, when he and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced a budget amendment to increase the Pentagon’s budget. At the time, Rubio argued that adjusted for inflation, defense spending had declined by 21 percent since 2010 -- a claim PolitiFact National rated Mostly True. Rubio’s amendment proposed restoring defense spending levels to what had been proposed in the spring of 2011, for fiscal 2012 going forward, by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Gates’ proposal was prior to spending limits that were imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became law in the summer of 2011. Returning to the so-called 2012 proposed spending levels would add $1 trillion in defense spending over 10 years, Benjamin Friedman, a defense research fellow at the liberatrian Cato Institute, told us. That is also the estimate made in a July 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The morning after the Milwaukee debate, Rubio was asked in a Fox News interview: "So, where are you going to get the trillion dollars from that Rand Paul says we shouldn’t be spending?" Rubio didn’t address the figure, saying: "First of all, before we fund anything, the federal government should be fully funding national security." But he has made references to the $1 trillion cost in the past. In a September 2014 speech, Rubio said he agreed with a recommendation by the bipartisan National Defense Panel to return to the 2012-level spending, "which we are on track to be around $1 trillion short of through fiscal year 2022." And on his campaign website, Rubio says he would restore defense spending to the 2012 level, "and begin to undo the damage caused by $1 trillion in indiscriminate defense cuts." Our rating Paul said Rubio is proposing a new $1 trillion "welfare program" and "$1 trillion in new military spending." It’s estimated that over 10 years, a common time frame for federal budget planning, Rubio’s child tax credit would result in the loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue; and his plan to reverse declines in Pentagon spending would cost $1 trillion. But it’s a stretch to call the tax credit welfare and in making his claim, Paul didn’t state that the $1 trillion costs would be over 10 years. We rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03449	On immigration reform, Marco Rubio "all along has been saying, 'We have to have border security first' " and then "he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/20/dana-rohrabacher/rep-dana-rohrabacher-says-sen-marco-rubios-claims-/	Has Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., promised one kind of immigration reform in English — and something else in Spanish? A Republican congressman from Orange County, Calif., recently accused Rubio of contradicting his pledge to put border security before legalization for undocumented immigrants. Rubio "all along has been saying, 'We have to have border security first,’ " Rep. Dana Rohrabacher told conservative WND Radio on June 16, 2013. "And then, he, you know, when he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way' or, 'Legalization status isn't contingent on border control.' Well, this is outrageous, and no one should believe him." At the heart of the claim, according to Rohrabacher’s office, is Rubio’s June 9 Spanish-language interview on Univision’s Al Punto. The eight-minute back-and-forth between Rubio and host Maria Elena Salinas made headlines across conservative media. "Marco Rubio: In immigration reform, legalization comes first — ‘It is not conditional,’ " said one headline from the Washington Examiner. "Rubio: Legalization first, border security whenever," said another from Human Events. Other conservative media offered a different take, such as a piece in the Daily Caller: "No, Rubio isn’t telling Spanish and English audiences different things." Rubio’s own website says, "The most important thing that happens on day one is that the toughest border security and enforcement plan in American history will be the law of the land." Has Rubio told two different stories about the Senate’s immigration bill? Steps to legality What’s going on here? We watched Rubio’s Univision interview, read transcripts in English and Spanish, and scouted his past comments to English-language audiences, such as interviews on Fox News and the Rush Limbaugh Show. In each, he described the bill’s multistep process. The government must submit to Congress a plan to secure the border. No earlier than that, it may begin processing applications from immigrants in the country illegally to get provisional status, a process that includes fines and a background check. Only when that border security plan has been substantially implemented may immigrants with provisional status apply for green cards. But while Rubio explained the same plan to each interviewer, he also tailored his language to address their concerns. In interviews with Limbaugh and Fox News host Sean Hannity, he focused on steps that must be achieved before immigrants are eligible to apply for green cards, which grant permanent legal status. On Univision, he focused on the provisional status process that begins at the same time that a plan to secure the border is submitted. For example, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity in January that enforcement would need to be in place, not just at the border but also for the visa system and in the workplace, "before there’s a path to a green card." Hannity noted that lawmakers’ framework for the immigration bill "said simultaneously." Rubio explained: "Here is what happens, when you're undocumented, you have to come forward and identify yourself and you're going to be fingerprinted and have a background check done. You're going to have to pay taxes and fines and what you get is a nonimmigrant visa, a nonimmigrant visa, a work permit to stay in the country and you don't qualify for any federal benefits under that. "You don't get federal benefits. During the same time, they're going to have to stay in this process for a significant period of time. While they're in that process is when all of this security stuff needs to happen. After a number of years have gone by and the security enforcement stuff is in place, then the second phase begins. "Which would give the people an opportunity to apply for a green card, the same way that everybody else does, not the special way, which means you have to stand in line with everyone in line, and apply, and in essence we're giving people the opportunity to earn the chance to do this the way they should have done it to begin with. "That's why they say simultaneous, and when you're in the probationary period that's when this is happening." Rubio had a similar exchange with Limbaugh in April, in which he walked the radio host through the different steps of implementation. He also offered such explanations to Bill O’Reilly, Lou Dobbs, and repeatedly to Hannity. That sets up this month’s Spanish-language interview. On Univision’s Al Punto, Salinas pressed Rubio on how he would attract 60 votes. He answered that he would earn his colleagues’ trust by making sure "that the border is secure and that another wave of illegal migration doesn’t take place in the future." (The English-language quotes are from Univision’s official English transcript, which we confirmed by watching the interview in Spanish.) Salinas asked him if he would abandon the legislation if lawmakers didn’t agree to strengthen border security even more. Rubio answered that he was committed to reform, but that the key to votes would be "a reasonable measure … to secure the border and prevent any sort of wave of illegal immigration in the future." Then came the exchange that set up the "legalization" quote that lit up the Internet: Salinas: At this time, the border is more secure than ever. There are 21,000 border agents, a 651-mile wall, more than 300 watchtowers. And the bill that you helped to write has even more funds for border security. So, what are the measures that you consider key for the Senate to approve the reform? What else do the Republicans want? Rubio: Well, the problem — not just Republicans. There are four, five Democrats who are also asking for it in the Senate. And the point is the following: What they want are details on exactly where those resources are going to be used because, yes, there are sectors of the border that are much more secure, but there are others that aren’t. For example, the area of Tucson, Arizona. So what they’re asking is that it not be left to the discretion of the administration or agencies, but that the law specifically says where and how those resources will be used so that there is no waste and that the errors of the past are not repeated. Salinas: And that can be done. Can you look for some type of … Rubio: Yes. Salinas: … phrase that can describe it in that way? Because we have to come up with something. At this point it’s the … Rubio: Yes, of course. Yes— Salinas: … Obama Administration, but in 12, 13 years when they’re eligible for legalization, many of those immigrants, we don’t know who will be in the White House. Rubio: Well, we’ll be clear. Nobody is talking here about preventing legalization. Legalization will take place. That is, the following things will come next. First comes legalization, then comes this border security measure and then comes the permanent residency process. What we are talking about here is the permanent residency system. Regarding legalization, a vast majority of my colleagues have already accepted that: that it must take place and that it must start at the same time we start with what has to do with security. That is not conditional. Legalization is not conditional. Now, and I repeat, we can do it, and that is the point, we must specifically spell out where will the additional towers go, where will the additional wall go, where will the additional fence go, where will the additional sensors be; to provide specifics about where and how the available funds will be used. So Salinas had asked about what might happen under the next administration. Rubio clarified that "legalization" would already be in place, distinguishing that temporary status from a later "permanent residency system." With Hannity and Limbaugh, he called that early phase "provisional status" or a "probationary period," and emphasized instead the border security that would have to be achieved under the law before immigrants were eligible to apply for green cards. Rohrabacher, in his interview June 16 with WND Radio, attacked those distinctions, saying, "This is just a lot of weasel words that Rubio and these people are throwing in. They’re going to legalize the status of people here illegally. Once they do that, that is an amnesty. And once they do that, there will be no border security improvements. It’ll all be a facade." But Rubio emphasized his commitment to a bill that required border security. Our ruling Rohrabacher claimed on WND Radio that Rubio "all along has been saying, 'We have to have border security first. And then, he, you know, when he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way' or, 'Legalization status isn't contingent on border control.’" We found, instead, that Rubio has explained the Senate bill’s multistep process, starting with a border security plan, in his English-language interviews with conservative hosts. He clarified that immigrants would be eligible to apply for provisional status at the same time. In Spanish, he also emphasized border security, but explained that immigrants would be eligible for provisional status — "legalization" — before the Obama administration left office. Rubio emphasized different parts of the bill’s process depending on his audience — particularly what he described as happening "first." But his explanations described the bill’s provisions the same way, in both English and in Spanish. We rate Rohrabacher’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05270	"Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/28/bob-gibbs/rep-bob-gibbs-touts-water-transportation-efficienc/	Rep. Bob Gibbs is a big proponent of water transportation. As chair of the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment (part of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure) he recently held a hearing on the soundness of the country’s inland waterway system, which includes the Ohio River. Gibbs, a Republican from Holmes County, finds the system lacking. Deferred maintenance resulting from budget constraints on the U.S. Corps of Engineers increases the likelihood of a calamity befalling the system, he said at the April 18 hearing. If improvements aren’t made, it could doom the country’s inland water system, he said, and that would be a costly bit of negligence because water transportation is a vital cog in our economy. "Water transportation is the most fuel efficient, least polluting, safest, and least expensive means of moving cargo," he said. That’s a pretty definitive statement. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. First of all, Gibbs was referring to inland waterways and their barge traffic that runs north and south along major navigable rivers, such as the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio. River barges usually carry large volumes of low-value commodities, such as grain and coal. They compete to varying degrees with railroads and trucks, but more often than not they work in tandem. Ninety percent of all barge traffic depends on a connection with either rail or truck, said Chris Dager, research economist at the University of Tennessee. Trillions of dollars of freight moves each year over the country’s transportation network, which includes 4 million miles of highways and roads, 140,000 miles of rail and 25,000 of commercially navigable waterways. The problem with a blanket statement that any form of transportation is the cheapest or safest is that it can vary depending on the circumstances. A commodities broker shipping corn from Iowa to New Orleans, for example, would send it by barge down the Mississippi, not by rail or truck. It will take longer to ship — the down river speed is about 9 mph — but cost far less. But if time is of the essence, or if a river with loading terminals isn’t handy, rail or truck may be the only feasible options. Over-the-road delivery has a cost advantage at times because a trucker can drop off a load hundreds of miles away and usually find something to haul back on his return trip. That’s known as back-hauling and while it occurs usually 90 percent of the time with long-haul trucks, the rate is only 45 to 50 percent for barges, said Larry Bray, a research economist at University of Tennessee. Railroads, on the other hand, usually return with empty cars, except for containers and boxcars. And some areas of a river are more efficient than others. On the lower Mississippi River, barges move along unimpeded, but on the upper reaches they move more slowly because of multiple dams and locks. And when it comes to delays, some rail and highway locations are legendary for their congestion. With all that in mind, let’s consider some numbers. As of 2010, a river barge could transport an average of 640 tons of cargo per mile on a gallon of diesel, Dager said, thanks to recent improvements that include barges with deeper drafts and computer systems that provide up-to-the-minute profiles of a river bottom. Railroads have made their own improvements, including larger railcars, better engines, and improved business modeling. They can now carry an average of 490 ton-miles of cargo per gallon of diesel, according to Dager. Trucks are the least fuel efficient, with an average of 75-to-150 ton-miles per gallon of diesel, depending on how far they travel. In addition, some social costs aren’t passed along to the consumer that need to be acknowledged. These include government subsidies for infrastructure (something trucks benefit from greatly, waterborne vessels to a much less extent, and railroads the least), congestion, and the effects on health and safety. Those costs in the aggregate are highest for trucks, followed by rail and then water transportation, according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office called "Surface Freight Transportation: A Comparison of the costs of Road, Rail, and Waterways Freight Shipments That Are Not Passed on to Consumers." And then there’s this statement from Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service: "Water transportation is one of the most economical ways to move cargo, especially bulk cargo." While there are comparative advantages to each mode of transportation, Moss said, on average water is the least expensive and most fuel efficient. So, it appears that Gibbs was correct when he said water transportation is the most fuel efficient way to move cargo, as well as the least expensive. He also said water transportation was the cleanest and safest way to move cargo. Those specific factors also are addressed in the GAO report. The report states that trucks generate 238 pounds of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less per million ton-miles of freight delivered. That compares to 36 pounds for rail locomotives and 23 pounds for waterborne vessels. Trucks also generate more than 6,000 pounds tons of nitrogen oxide per million ton-miles, compared with nearly 1,350 pounds for locomotives and about 938 pounds for waterborne vessels. And when it comes to greenhouse gases, barges spew forth the least amount. Finally, water transportation accounts for fewer accidents and injuries per ton-mile of delivered freight than trucks and rail, according to the GAO. Gibbs said that water transportation is the cheapest, safest, cleanest and most fuel efficient way to move cargo. Clearly, it’s the most fuel efficient on average. It’s also safer and cleaner. As for the expense, because barge traffic is so dependent on rail and trucking, those two modes of transportation could have an impact. But that said, the experts we talked to were persuasive that on average, water transportation is least expensive. On the Truth-O-Meter, Gibbs’ statement rates True.

pomt-08233	President Obama, Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi passed a "$1.2 trillion stimulus bill."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/16/george-allen/george-allen-says-obama-pelosi-reid-passed-12-tril/	In the wake of midterm elections, former U.S. Sen. George Allen is urging the new Congress to stop funding the stimulus bill. Under a set of legislative priorities posted on his website, Allen says: "The new Congress must repeal and cutoff any additional money borrowed and set aside for Obama, Reid and Pelosi's $1.2 trillion stimulus spending bill." The $1.2 trillion price tag was a new to us, so we checked it out. Allen’s executive assistant Tim Nussbaum said the source is CNN Money.com’s Bailout Tracker, which focuses on government programs designed to jump start the economy. Among the various categories in the Bailout Tracker is one called "Federal Stimulus Programs." Within that category are six programs which collectively represent $1.2 trillion in spending. Those programs include the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, unemployment benefit extension, student loan guarantees, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an advanced technology vehicles manufacturing program and the Cash for Clunkers program. And that takes us to the heart of the first major problem with Allen’s claim. He refers to one stimulus spending bill and then attempts to validate the $1.2 trillion number by pointing to the combined funding for six separate programs. Here’s the second big problem: the six programs that collectively represent the $1.2 trillion weren’t all approved under the Obama administration. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, for example, which represents $168 billion of the $1.2 trillion total was passed under President George W. Bush. So was the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. Now, if we are to assume that Allen is referring in his claim to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also called the Stimulus, the total provided was $787.2 billion including tax relief and stimulus funds. That’s a long way from $1.2 trillion. Recent estimates put the 2009 Stimulus total a bit higher. The Congressional Budget Office in August put the total cost for the stimulus -- from February 2009 through 2019 -- at $814 billion. Still not close. So, looking back, this is an open and shut case. Allen is clearly distorting the facts by using the $1.2 trillion total for six individual programs, not all of which were approved under the Obama administration, and applying it to a single bill. In reality, the 2009 Stimulus bill Allen alludes to represents a total cost of about $814 billion. That’s almost $400 billion shy of the $1.2 trillion figure he cites. And just to put that number in perspective, $400 billion is what shoppers spent at Wal-Mart in 2009. It roughly equals the total 13-year expenses of Virginia’s state government between 1999 and 2012. Allen is not only exaggerating the spending total by President Obama and the Democratic leaders of Congress, he is doing it by including billions of dollars passed under a Republican president. That’s just not false, it’s ridiculous. So we have to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.

pomt-01183	At the 50 Milwaukee schools serving "at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low income" students, the reading proficiency is 8%.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/05/alberta-darling/alberta-darling-says-reading-proficiency-8-50-low-/	Studies have long documented the lagging reading performance of Milwaukee students compared with pupils statewide. Now, some officials are spotlighting poor results at a subset of Milwaukee schools -- those serving very high concentrations of African-Americans from lower-income households. "We can’t turn our backs on these children anymore," state Sen. Alberta Darling told radio talker Brian Schimming on Dec. 2, 2014. "There’s a report out about the crisis in Milwaukee, the lack of access to high quality education." Darling, a Republican from River Hills in Milwaukee’s northern suburbs, focused on schools in which at least 80 percent of students are low-income and 80 percent are black. "There are 50 of these schools in Milwaukee, and their reading proficiency on the statewide test is 8 percent. Eight percent! It’s shockingly low." Darling’s remarks on WISN-AM (1130) radio came as she again endorsed legislation forcing Milwaukee Public Schools to sell more vacant schools at a time when such facilities are sought by competing private schools that participate in the taxpayer-funded Milwaukee school voucher program. But, it is important to note, her comments did not single out public schools. Is Darling right? Examining the claim Darling’s office told us she got the numbers from an education newsletter published in 2014 by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. That newsletter says the reading proficiency was "below 8%" at the selected schools. The MMAC, it turns out, drew the number from research done by Henry Tyson, superintendent of St. Marcus Lutheran School, a major participant in the Milwaukee voucher program. The school has tried unsuccessfully to buy school buildings from MPS to expand. Tyson’s research focused on about 50 schools that, like St. Marcus, offer kindergarten through eighth grade. Darling’s comments didn’t specify a certain type of school. So we did our own look at reading scores at all Milwaukee schools fitting the 80/80 description, including high schools and separate elementary and middle schools that include smaller groupings of grades. Our main data source: the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. Why are officials focusing on these schools at all? High-poverty schools tend to have lower achievement than low-poverty schools. Milwaukee's highest-poverty schools serve racial minorities. Milwaukee's black students post some of the lowest achievement scores nationally among black students nationwide in certain grades and subjects. To the numbers Under Tyson’s approach, the K-8 schools, we found 57 that met the criteria. Their average schoolwide reading proficiency score: 7.9 percent. In the broader pool of schools, which tallied 95 schools, the average was 7.3 percent. So the 8 percent claim is on target. Of course, this is the reading average based on the collective reading proficiency at each school. It doesn’t mean every school came in at the overall school average of 7.3 percent. Five schools, for example, had not a single pupil score proficient in reading on the state tests, which are administered to students in third through eighth grades, and once in high school, in 10th grade. The state assigned those schools a 0 percent score. On the other end of the scale, the best reading proficiency score at an 80/80 school was 21 percent at Hartford Avenue University School in MPS. Second (20 percent) was Franklin School, also in MPS. St. Marcus Lutheran was third (19 percent). Let’s put the overall 7 percent reading proficiency into a broader context. Across MPS, for all students and all schools, about 15 percent of students scored proficient in reading on the fall 2013 state assessments, about twice as high as the score at the schools Darling mentioned. Across Wisconsin, 36.6 percent of students scored proficient or better in reading that year, though just 21 percent of economically disadvantaged students met that bar. Among the state's black students, 14 percent scored at least proficient in reading. Interactive table: A look at the schools and how they fare It is important to note that the scores are so low, in part, due to the state raising the bar for what's considered a proficient score on the state test. Another data note: reading results for private schools are based on their publicly funded students, not their private payers or scholarship students. Results by school type We broke out reading results for public schools in MPS, private schools in the choice program, and independent charter schools. The small number of charter schools scored somewhat better that the rest as a group, with a 10.3 percent average proficiency. Next was MPS (7.8 percent) followed by the choice schools (6.2 percent). The bottom-10 schools included seven choice schools and three from MPS. The 10 at the top included five from MPS, four voucher schools (all Lutheran) and one independent charter. Our rating Darling said that at the 50 Milwaukee schools serving "at least 80% African-American and at least 80% low income" students," the reading proficiency is 8%. That’s accurate to within a few tenths of a percentage point, under the state’s tougher new grading scale. We rate her claim True.

pomt-07194	Says the federal government threatened to impose a no-fly zone in Texas if state legislators bar airport security officials from performing pat-downs.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/08/waco-tea-party/waco-tea-party-says-federal-government-threatened-/	Supporting legislation to bar federal officers from "groping" passengers during airport security screenings, the Waco Tea Party said in a May 25 email blast: "The federal government has threatened Texas lawmakers with a no-fly zone if they pass" the proposal. House Bill 1937, which stalled in the Senate before the end of the regular session May 30, would make it a misdemeanor offense for public servants, such as Transportation Security Administration officials, to intentionally, knowingly or recklessly touch the private parts of passengers seeking access to public buildings and transportation. We wondered if the feds really threatened to stop airplanes from flying over Texas if the ban passed. To our request for backup, Toby Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, pointed us to a May 24 letter from the U.S. Department of Justice posted online by the Lone Star Report, a weekly newsletter published by the conservative-leaning Lone Star Foundation. Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in the western district of Texas, sent us a copy of the letter, which was addressed to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus, Robert Haney, chief clerk of the Texas House, and Texas Senate Secretary Patsy Spaw. In it, U.S. Attorney John Murphy of San Antonio writes: "This office, as well as the Southern, Northern and Eastern District of Texas United States Attorneys, would like to advise you of the significant legal and practical problems that will be created if this bill becomes law." The letter says it appears the intent of the bill is to prevent TSA officials from barring passengers "who otherwise would have been subjected to a pat down" from entering the secure area of the airport. It urges lawmakers to "consider the ramifications of this bill before casting your vote." If enacted, the bill would "directly interfere with the Transportation Security Administration’s responsibility for civil aviation security," the letter says. "The federal government would likely seek an emergency stay of the statute. Unless such a stay were granted, TSA would likely be required to cancel any flight or series of flights for which it could not ensure the safety of passengers and crew." Would that make Texas a no-fly zone? Generally, a no-fly zone prohibits aircraft from flying in airspace without special permission. Recently, for example, the United Nations signed off on a no-fly zone over Libya to protect Libyans against the government forces of leader Moammar Gadhafi, according to March 18 CNN news article. A March 17 UN press release says the no-fly zone bans all flights except those for humanitarian aid, the evacuation of foreign nationals, or those "deemed necessary for the benefit of the Libyan people." We also found examples of more localized no-fly zones. In February 2010, Connecticut secured a temporary no-fly zone over the site of a power plant explosion due to the instability of the damaged building, according to a Feb. 7, 2010 press release. When a Wyoming municipal airport opened in 2003, according to the National Park Service, a permanent no-fly zone was created to steer planes clear of Devils Tower National Monument, a sacred site to more than 20 American Indian tribes located near the airport. And according to a Oct. 15, 2009, news post by a California ABC affiliate, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a temporary no-fly zone for aircraft within the 10-mile radius where President Barack Obama was staying in Oakland for the duration of a fundraising trip. Fields, with the U.S. attorney’s office, declined to comment. "The letter speaks for itself," he said. According to a May 24 Texas Tribune news article, state Sen. Dan Patrick said two TSA officials, not identified in the story, visited him and said it "could close down all the airports in Texas." Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz said the lieutenant governor "certainly felt the Department of Justice’s position was threatening." John Pike, director of the private Virginia-based company Global Security, which specializes in defense and military background information, speculated that the legislation would effectively grind flights to a halt depending on how many passengers need to be patted down each day — and how many flights would be affected if TSA agents were prohibited from doing so. Responding to our query, TSA spokesman Luis Casanova told us that approximately 3 percent of airline passengers receive an "enhanced pat-down." To put that in context, at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the state’s largest, TSA screens approximately 50,000 people a day, Casanova said. So some 1,500 receive a pat-down. We asked if not patting down those people could cause the airport to cancel all flights. Casanova said he couldn’t speculate, but said that TSA shut down one DFW terminal after a person passed security checkpoints without the proper screening. What earns some passengers extra scrutiny? Casanova said TSA agents must administer a pat-down to any passenger who declines to pass through a metal detector or body scanner, or if the metal-detector alarm continues to sound after the passenger has gone through and agents can’t tell why. According to a TSA blog post updated May 27, TSA officers must resolve each alarm before allowing the related passenger and their baggage on an airplane. Also, Casanova said, some passengers are randomly subjected to pat-downs — a move designed to deter terrorist activity. Truth-O-Meter says? The feds raised the specter of canceled flights if the Texas bill passes and if a court doesn’t keep it from taking effect. Exactly how those cancelations would play out, the feds declined to say. In any case, that eventuality is not quite the same as threatening to impose a no-fly zone. We rate the statement as Half True.

pomt-05107	Obama "said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-barack-obama-once-said-individual/	Moments after the Supreme Court ruled that it was largely upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, Republicans zeroed in on the court's decision to allow the individual mandate because it is enforced through a tax. One of the Republicans to speak out was former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice presidential nominee. After the court's decision was announced on June 28, 2012, Palin tweeted, "Obama lied to the American people. Again. He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom dies." We aren’t able to fact-check whether "freedom" is dying, which is solidly in the realm of opinion. However, we can check her claim that Obama said the individual mandate, a requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty, "wasn't a tax." That was the basis for the court's decision to uphold the law. Did Obama say the individual mandate wasn’t a tax? Given how unpopular taxes are, it’s understandable why Obama would not trumpet the notion that the mandate was a tax. But has he said it was not a tax? We could find only one example after Obama was president in which he or a top aide explicitly stated that the mandate wasn’t a tax. (When we asked, the Republican National Committee couldn’t come up with any other examples, either.) The one instance came on Sept. 20, 2009, in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Here’s an excerpt: Stephanopoulos: Under this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don’t. How is that not a tax? Obama: Well, hold on a second, George. Here — here’s what’s happening. You and I are both paying $900, on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now what I’ve said is that if you can’t afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s just piling on. If, on the other hand, we’re giving tax credits, we’ve set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool, we’ve driven down the costs, we’ve done everything we can and you actually can afford health insurance, but you’ve just decided, you know what, I want to take my chances. And then you get hit by a bus and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care, that’s… Stephanopoulos: That may be, but it’s still a tax increase. Obama: No. That’s not true, George. The — for us to say that you’ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it’s saying is, is that we’re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase. People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I’m not covering all the costs. Stephanopoulos: But it may be fair, it may be good public policy… Obama: No, but — but, George, you — you can’t just make up that language and decide that that’s called a tax increase. … What if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 or 8 or 10 percent next year and you say well, that’s not a tax increase; but, on the other hand, if I say that I don’t want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable, then… Stephanopoulos: I don’t think I’m making it up. Merriam Webster’s Dictionary: Tax — "a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes." Obama: George, the fact that you looked up Merriam’s Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you’re stretching a little bit right now. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition. I mean what… Stephanopoulos: I wanted to check for myself. But your critics say it is a tax increase. Obama: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I’m taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we’re going to have an individual mandate or not, but… Stephanopoulos: But you reject that it’s a tax increase? Obama: I absolutely reject that notion. Sliced up into brief sound bites, the back-and-forth between Stephanopoulos offers some clear evidence of Obama arguing that the mandate is not a tax, most obviously when he says that the mandate "is absolutely not a tax increase." Still, it’s worth noting that Obama made the case that the alternative was worse -- that not having an individual mandate would be unfair and inefficient. The absence of an individual mandate, Obama argued, means passing on the costs of treating Americans uninsured to people who are insured, which amounts to a "tax" on those with coverage, even though it may not be literally fit the dictionary definition of a tax. In essence, Obama was brushing off complaints that he was imposing a tax by contending that a "tax" was already in place under the status quo. Our ruling Palin is correct that Obama "said (the individual mandate) wasn't a tax." It’s right there in the video. We rate the statement True. UPDATE: BuzzFeed has collected videos of Obama administration officials being asked about whether the individual mandate was a tax.

pomt-08035	"More than 125 jobs have been created" at the Milwaukee Job Corps Center.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/05/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-says-125-jobs-have-bee/	The Milwaukee Job Corps Center didn’t open for business until Jan. 3, 2011. But six weeks earlier, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett suggested the education and job-training facility had already become a major job creator. "The Job Corps is both preparing the next generation of workers and providing jobs for current workers," Barrett said in a newsletter published Nov. 19, 2010. "The first students will arrive in January. The center is expected to be at capacity with 300 students by the end of June. To date, more than 125 jobs have been created." That sounds impressive. But jobs already created through a center that wasn’t yet open -- and is aimed at job training, not job creation? We decided to get to the bottom of it all. Job Corps is a 46-year-old federal program funded by Congress and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. The program provides free education and training to more than 100,000 low-income people ages 16 to 24 at 124 locations around the country. Students can earn a high school diploma or GED, get specific vocational training and get help in finding jobs. Jobs Corps cost $1.68 billion in 2009. How well does it work? The Labor Department’s most recent assessment, which examined performance in 2008, found mixed results on two major goals: 66 percent of students either got jobs, or entered post-high school education or advanced training, within three months of finishing Job Corps. That was a decline from 84 percent in 2004 and below the program’s 2008 target of 74 percent. 55 percent attained a high school diploma or GED within nine months of completing Job Corps. That was down from 64 percent in 2004, but it exceeded the 2008 target of 54 percent. Milwaukee applied for a Job Corps Center in 1993 but didn’t win the federal funding until 2003. The city’s $28 million facility, built on 25 acres on the former Bacher Farm on the city’s northwest side, opened for 14 students the first week of January 2011, said James Roberts, the center director. Most will live in dormitories on the campus, where they will get free room and board, and some clothing. For most students, the education and training run for at least 8 1/2 months, but can run for as long as three years. That means it will be about September before any will be ready for jobs. So what about the 125 jobs Barrett said have been created? According to Roberts, they are all federally funded staff positions at the Job Corps facility itself, everything from instructors and career counselors to cooks and custodians. Nearly all the positions are full-time and most have been filled. When politicians announce job creations, the public typically thinks of new jobs in the private sector, but that’s not the case here. In this case, there are 125 taxpayer-funded jobs that have been added to run the Job Corps Center. But the center itself doesn’t create jobs; it trains people for jobs. And it likely will not have trained anyone to be ready for work until late 2011. For our work on this item, it’s time to call it a day. Even before the Milwaukee Job Corps Center opened, Mayor Tom Barrett touted the fact "more than 125 jobs have been created." There are about 125 new jobs as a result of the new facility -- those needed to run the center. However, the facility itself is not aimed at job creation, but job training -- and it isn’t expected to have trained any students to be ready for jobs until at least September.

pomt-05850	Says Barack Obama "endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/13/wayne-lapierre/nra-leader-says-barack-obama-endorsed-total-ban-ha/	Wayne LaPierre, a longtime leader of the National Rifle Association, says President Barack Obama is biding his time to destroy the Second Amendment. The group’s executive vice president spoke for the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Feb. 10, 2012, arguing the president’s strategy has been to "hide, shroud and cloak" his anti-gun plans. One piece of evidence for that hidden agenda against the right to bear arms, LaPierre said: "(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns." A @PolitiFact Twitter follower wanted to know: Really? Flashback Turns out, we’ve seen a similar claim before. Back in 2008, the NRA said that then-Sen. Barack Obama had a 10-point plan to "change" the Second Amendment, including a ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns. We found it False, saying a "fuzzy stand in ‘96 does not amount to a plan." This time, LaPierre said that Obama "endorsed a total ban." Does his wording make a difference? Here’s the shred of truth behind LaPierre’s rhetoric: In 1996, Obama’s campaign for Illinois Senate filled out a questionnaire for a state voter group. (Maybe Obama did it; maybe his campaign manager did. A spokesman for his 2008 presidential campaign later said that staff "unintentionally mischaracterized his position," and that he never saw the survey.) The questionnaire asked about Obama’s stance on various issues, including, "Do you support state legislation to … ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?" The typed answer: Yes. (You can see the questionnaire here and here, and read stories about it by the Associated Press and POLITICO.) Obama never endorsed a "total ban." But his campaign for state Senate almost 16 years ago did say yes to supporting such a ban on a state level in a questionnaire. What came of the campaign endorsement of such a policy? The Associated Press noted that Obama's legislative record in Illinois "shows strong support for gun restrictions, such as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, but no attempts to ban them." On a different questionnaire eight years later, Obama’s position was that "a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable" but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed, AP reported. The president’s policies Has Obama’s presidential administration shown sympathy for banning handguns? In 2009, FactCheck.org said, "We’ve seen little or no evidence that the Obama administration is doing much to regulate guns or gun ownership." In 2010, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave the president a report card of seven F’s for his first year in office, including on "standing up the to the gun lobby." We talked with Caroline Brewer, director of communications for the Brady Center’s sister organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "We certainly don't have a record of him calling for a ban of any kind on handguns in the United States," she said. "... There's no logical reason to believe the president would ever advocate the banning of all handguns, and we as organization don't advocate for that, either." She noted that after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings that injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the president called for better background checks, not banning guns. Here’s a quote from that Obama op-ed, as published in the Arizona Daily Star on March 13, 2011: "Now, like the majority of Americans, I believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. And the courts have settled that as the law of the land. In this country, we have a strong tradition of gun ownership that's handed from generation to generation. Hunting and shooting are part of our national heritage. And, in fact, my administration has not curtailed the rights of gun owners — it has expanded them, including allowing people to carry their guns in national parks and wildlife refuges. … "I'm willing to bet that responsible, law-abiding gun owners agree that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few — dangerous criminals and fugitives, for example — from getting their hands on a gun in the first place. "I'm willing to bet they don't think that using a gun and using common sense are incompatible ideas — that we should check someone's criminal record before he can check out at a gun seller; that an unbalanced man shouldn't be able to buy a gun so easily; that there's room for us to have reasonable laws that uphold liberty, ensure citizen safety and are fully compatible with a robust Second Amendment." (It’s true, by the way, that Obama repealed Reagan-era rules to keep loaded guns out of national parks, something else that didn’t sit well with the Brady Campaign.) LaPierre argues Obama’s rhetoric is a sign that he’s biding his time until a second term, when he’ll unfurl his full anti-gun agenda — an uncheckable prediction. (See: "Obama’s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016.") However, none of Obama’s previous years in office hint at the kind of extreme policy push the NRA claims he’s yearning to unleash. Our ruling LaPierre said "(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns." Obama’s 1996 campaign for state Senate did endorse a state-level ban, on a questionnaire from which he has since distanced himself. He never suggested such a law in office, and later questionnaires showed a more nuanced approach, as have his more recent statements on gun control, including those during his time in the U.S. Senate and as president. In fact, his gun-control agenda has earned him failing grades from a prominent gun-control advocacy group. We can’t rule on a shadowy conspiracy to destroy the Constitution in Obama’s second term. But we can say that LaPierre’s claim that Obama endorsed a total ban on handguns contains a small element of truth (a typewritten "yes" on a long-ago questionnaire about a state ban) but ignores critical facts — that is, Obama's statements and record — that would give a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2012-02-13T15:10:11	2012-02-10	['None']
pomt-13796	Says Hillary Clinton "lied about why her parents named her Hillary."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/mitch-mcconnell/did-hillary-clinton-lie-about-being-named-after-si/	Republicans hope to label Hillary Clinton as a dishonest person unworthy of the White House. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reached back about as far as one can go in Clinton’s biography for an example. McConnell said that Clinton "lied about her emails, she lied about her server, she lied about Benghazi, she lied about sniper fire — why she even lied about why her parents named her Hillary." Here, we’ll look at the last one: Would Hillary Clinton lie about the origins of her name? The public discussion of the anecdote about Clinton’s naming dates back to her time as first lady. In April 1995, she was on a goodwill tour of Asia and stopped in Nepal, the country that’s home of Mount Everest, which was first climbed in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal. "At an airstrip in Katmandu, Nepal — just after an overnight tiger safari and just before her departure for this poverty-ridden pocket of South Asia — Mrs. Clinton shook hands with" the famous climber, then 75, the New York Times reported. During the brief meeting, Clinton "confessed that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had read an article about the intrepid Edmund Hillary, a one-time beekeeper who had taken to mountain climbing, when she was pregnant with her daughter in 1947 and liked the name," the Times wrote. " ‘It had two l's, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,’ Mrs. Clinton told reporters after the brief meeting on the tarmac, minutes before her Air Force jet flew past the peak of Everest itself. ‘So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it's because of Sir Edmund Hillary.’ " For years, this story wasn’t widely discussed — it wasn’t mentioned in Hillary Clinton’s 2003 autobiography, Living History, for instance — but it did make its way into the autobiography of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which was published in 2004. Within a few years, though, the story attracted some attention on the Internet when someone realized a key discrepancy -- the mountain climber achieved worldwide fame six years after Clinton was born. Eventually, in October 2006, a Clinton spokeswoman walked the story back. "It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Hanley, according to the New York Times. When the urban-legends checking site Snopes.com looked at the controversy, it noted that it actually wasn’t impossible that Clinton’s mother could have heard about Hillary by the time her daughter was born. It noted that he was already gaining some renown as a mountain climber prior to 1953, and even as early as the pre-World War II period. Still, when Snopes scrutinized several major American newspapers, including the Rodhams’ hometown Chicago Tribune, prior to 1953, it couldn’t find any evidence that the mountain climber had been profiled. This suggests that he was still too obscure a figure to have attracted Dorothy Rodham’s attention. It was "almost certainly a bit of fiction invented for political expediency," Snopes concluded. We reached out to the Clinton campaign for this article but did not hear back. Our ruling McConnell said that Clinton "even lied about why her parents named her Hillary." Clinton certainly said in 1995 that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, but Clinton was born a few years before the mountain climber became famous. However, McConnell fails to note that a spokeswoman eventually said the story was told to her by Clinton’s mother to inspire her. McConnell’s claim is partially accurate but lacks important context.

pomt-14326	"Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/mar/29/tim-finchem/pga-tour-commissioner-says-austin-fastest-growing-/	The PGA Tour's chief, otherwise just another Austin visitor impressed by the capital’s vim and vig, ventured a claim about local growth that made us wonder. On March 27, 2016, the tour's commissioner, Tim Finchem, told reporters including the Austin American-Statesman’s Kirk Bohls that the 2016 World Golf Championship-Dell Match Play Championship wrapping up that day at the Austin Country Club had been a "home run." "Austin is such a cool town," Finchem said, expressing hope the event would occur there again. And, he said, "Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years." Good grief. Really? We’ve gauged before how much Austin grows--even by the day. But has it outpaced the growth of every U.S. city over the past five years? News story Finchem's likely source We failed to hear back from Finchem or the PGA Tour. But we suspect an American-Statesman news story published three days before he spoke fueled his claim. That story said: "From July 2014 to July 2015, the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area — which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties — grew from 1,943,465 to 2,000,860, making it the fastest-growing metropolitan area with a population over 1 million for the fifth year in a row." Ryan Robinson, Austin’s city demographer, commented: "That of course won’t be news to anyone who lives here. We’ve become so accustomed to that very high level of population growth being part of our daily existence." Robinson further said Austin has the most diversified economy in the state. The fastest-growth distinction described in the news story drew on just-updated U.S. Census Bureau data indicating that from July 2014 through June 2015, the Austin area’s 2.95 percent population growth outpaced the 2.6 percent growth in the Orlando, Florida, area, which landed No. 2 nationally among the largest metropolitan areas, as this compilation shows (check out the Statesman’s population interactive here): Houston area led nation in raw growth But by raw population gains, the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metro area gained the most residents nationally in 2014-15 and also over five years during which the region drew nearly 750,000 additional residents, according to bureau figures. Dallas-Fort Worth landed second over those years, notching 676,582 added residents. In contrast, the Austin area’s five-year gain of 284,571 residents placed it 11th nationally in raw growth, according to the bureau. A March 2016 Houston Chronicle news story noted: "As a whole, the so-called Texas Triangle of Houston, Austin/San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth added more people last year than any other state in the country, growing by more than 400,000 residents, or roughly the population of Minneapolis." Authorities confirm Austin region’s leading-edge growth But rates of population growth are arguably the best way to fairly compare changes in different regions and cities. So we asked federal and Austin experts if the capital indeed led the nation in its rate of population growth. Basically yes, we heard, with caveats. By email, a Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, provided a chart indicating that among cities of 50,000 residents or more, Austin by itself -- not considering nearby cities and counties -- ranked 23rd for its 12.5 percent growth from April 2010 through June 2014. The fastest-growing municipality was South Jordan City, Utah, which is part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. According to the bureau, Texas cities that grew faster than Austin in that period include a Dallas suburb, Frisco (23.9 percent); Cedar Park, northwest of Austin; McKinney; Conroe; Midland; Pearland; New Braunfels; Odessa; League City and Round Rock (which placed No. 22 nationally with 12.8 percent growth). But Austin by itself sticks out on the chart as the most populous city also ranking among the nation’s highest rate of growth. That is, Austin’s estimated July 2014 population of 912,791 outpaced the population of the next-most-populous city with faster growth -- Irvine, California, home to 248,531 residents -- by 267 percent. Bernstein told us that if you limit your focus to cities of 250,000 residents or more, Austin ranked No. 1 in its percentage growth over the 2010-2014 period. He said city population changes from July 2014 through June 2015 would be released in May 2016. Separately by email, Beverly Kerr of the Austin Chamber of Commerce said that if you consider all metropolitan areas, the Austin region didn’t rank No. 1 in percentage growth from April 2010 through June 2015. Among "all metros," Kerr said, the Midland area and The Villages region in Florida outgrew the greater Austin area, per this chart she downloaded. Bernstein, following up, told us the greater Austin area ranked No. 1 in growth rate among metro areas with 200,000 residents or more. Our ruling Finchem said: "Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years." Census data support his claim, though a few clarifications are in order. Over five years, the greater Austin area, sweeping in several counties, had the fastest growth rate of any metro area that was also home to 200,000 residents or more. And from April 2010 through June 2014, Austin by itself ranked first by growth rate among cities with 250,000 residents or more; less populous cities grew faster.

pomt-01935	"When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary," Wisconsin saw "billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burke-tied-billions-tax-hik/	Gov. Scott Walker’s latest TV ad seeks to link his leading rival for governor to "billions" in tax increases approved under Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The new TV spot, which uses a gambling motif complete with playing cards that depict Doyle as a joker and Burke as a queen, says: "When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary, they gambled taxpayer money on dreadful policies, like billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage." The ad then blames the duo for "state budgets that created billions in deficits, and unemployment rates above the national average for the only time in 25 years." "Wisconsin can’t afford to be dealt another bad hand by Mary Burke," it concludes. The unemployment rate claim is a familiar one. We gave the state Republican Party a Mostly True when it said "The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary." But what about the tax-hike claim in the ad? When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marré for back up, she pointed in part to fiscal estimates for specific tax and fee increases in the proposed 2007-’09 state budget, as calculated by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is considered the gold standard for budget scorekeeping. The estimates show that when Burke was commerce secretary (Feb. 2005 - Nov. 2007), Doyle’s proposed 2007-’09 budget sought a higher tax on nursing home beds and proposed a new tax on oil company revenues based on vehicle fuel sales. What about taxes on "garbage" and "phones"? They are not listed as tax increases, but the same Fiscal Bureau report tallies fee increases. Doyle sought increases in "tipping fees" for disposing of recyclables and industrial waste. And he sought fees on telecommunications companies to help fund various library services. The gas and nursing home taxes came to $305 million in Doyle’s two-year budget proposal. The fees would have added another $61 million. Grand total: $366 million. That’s far short of the "billions" mentioned in the TV ad. The gap grows when you look at the final version of that 2007 budget as signed by Doyle. The Legislature, which was under split control of Democrats and Republicans, changed the budget and the final budget included $19 million in increases for the items mentioned in the TV ad. In the list she sent us, Marré added a big item not mentioned in the TV ad: a $414 million tax increase on hospital’s revenue, to support state health programs. It didn’t make it into the adopted budget, but even if you count that proposal, the tally is $780 million, not "billions." When asked about the ad’s "billions" claim, Marré contended other Doyle budgets -- not just 2007-09 -- are fair game. The TV ad, she said, is meant to refer to tax increases at any point in Doyle’s time (2003-2011) -- or increases during Burke’s state time. But the ad isn’t clear on that. The ad’s language -- "When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary" -- refers to their time together. And Burke was around for development of just one budget. Later budget Nevertheless, we took a look at the 2009-11 budget, which Marré argued should be included when evaluating the ad. By our calculation, that second budget proposal contained $520 million to $1.35 billion in new taxes and fees on the four items cited in the ad. (It depends on whether you count $830 million in fees on telecommunications companies as a levy on "phones"; the bill barred companies from passing it directly along on consumers’ bills). So if you add the two budgets together, there were as much as $1.7 billion in new taxes on those four items. But there’s a major problem with tying Burke to that budget. She left more than a year before it was proposed. Marré brought up one last point, a quote from Burke that is also in the TV ad, which says, "Mary Burke came out saying, ‘I support Gov. Doyle’s positions entirely.’" Burke did say that, in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal: Q: Are you politically active? Burke: No, and I can't say why or why not...I've always been an independent. I've always voted for who I thought was the best person for the position. I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely. I'm very impressed, and I'm starting to feel very Democratic at this point because I feel he is just doing so much that's right for Wisconsin that creates a better place to live for everyone." The comment is sweeping, so it’s fair game. But it’s from April 2005. That gives it limited value at best as evidence of how Burke felt about a Doyle budget proposed after she left state government. Our rating In a campaign ad, Walker says that "when Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary," Wisconsin saw "billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage." As a cabinet secretary, Burke would have had some impact on one of Doyle’s budgets. And it did contain increases on those four items. But the ad misfires badly on the math and the blame game. Proposed new taxes and fees in that one budget totalled $366 million on nursing homes, gas, garbage and phones, not "billions." And the tally was far less in the final version of the budget Doyle signed. Beyond that, Burke was gone when Doyle’s subsequent budget sought up to $1.35 billion more for those items in 2009. We rate Walker’s claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-06-26T05:00:00	2014-06-20	['Wisconsin', 'Jim_Doyle']
pomt-09851	Health care reform will not affect veterans' benefits.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/david-axelrod/axelrod-gets-it-right-vet-benefits/	The White House is fighting chain e-mails with chain e-mails. After spending days responding to inaccurate e-mails about the health care reform plan, the White House responded with its own e-mail from David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. The subject line was "Something worth forwarding." "This is probably one of the longest e-mails I’ve ever sent, but it could be the most important," Axelrod wrote. "Across the country we are seeing vigorous debate about health insurance reform. Unfortunately, some of the old tactics we know so well are back — even the viral e-mails that fly unchecked and under the radar, spreading all sorts of lies and distortions.” One such distortion, Axelrod said, is the suggestion that veterans' access to health care will be blocked by the bill. "It’s a myth that health insurance reform will affect veterans' access to the care they get now," Axelrod wrote. "To the contrary, the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded. The VA health care system will continue to be available for all eligible veterans." The White House has also posted a video about the issue on its Web site. The rumor may have started when a coalition of six veterans groups wrote a letter on July 30, 2009, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing concern that the bill might penalize vets who get health coverage through the VA but don't have private health insurance. The House version of the bill mandates coverage by requiring individuals to have a health insurance plan or pay a penalty based on their income. And businesses would have to contribute 65 percent of workers' family insurance premiums or pay an 8 percent penalty. "We wanted to make sure that, if someone is enrolled with the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], they didn't fall into this category" of having to pay a fine because they didn't have private coverage, said David Autry, a spokesman for the Disabled American Veterans. "Businesses might have been less willing to hire vets who may be enrolled in the VA health care plan," said Tom Zampieri, director of government relations for the Blinded Veterans Association. Those concerns have since been addressed through a series of amendments to the House bill, according to Zampieri and Autry. Nothing in the House bill would affect veterans' current coverage, they both said. Vets will continue to get those services from the VA. "What the White House is saying is true," said Bernard Edelman, deputy director for policy and government affairs for the Vietnam Veterans of America. Edelman said that another part of the White House claim – that “the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded” – also adds up. Obama’s first budget plan opened the VA’s doors to about that many vets previously excluded from care. So, by all accounts, the administration is correct that health care reform will not keep veterans from getting the care they currently receive. So for this one, Axelrod earns a True.

pomt-01790	Governing magazine has "estimated that in the states that don’t expand Medicaid, a minimum, they said of 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in those states..."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/25/richard-saslaw/saslaw-says-40-percent-rural-hospitals-will-close-/	State Sen. Richard Saslaw says rural hospitals are imperiled in Virginia and other states that don’t expand their Medicaid programs. "We all get that magazine, `Governing,’ and they’ve estimated that in the states that don’t expand Medicaid, a minimum, they said of 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in those states..." Saslaw, D-Fairfax, said during a recent radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. We hadn’t heard of such a dire estimate and we wondered whether Saslaw was correct. Let’s start with some background. Saslaw, the Senate minority leader, strongly backs expanding eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to as many as 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. Under the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the cost. General Assembly Republicans have blocked the expansion, however, saying Washington can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. Obamacare, when it was approved in 2010, required all states to extend Medicaid eligibility to households earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line. The idea was to make sure that people who couldn’t afford health insurance could gain coverage either through broadened Medicaid programs or subsidized policies bought on by newly-created health exchanges. Because more people would have coverage, the ACA called for the gradual reduction of federal payments -- Disproportionate Share Hospital , or DSH -- to hospitals that treat large numbers uninsured patients. But the trade-off was upset by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2012 ruling that allowed each state to decide whether to expand Medicaid. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have opted in. Twenty-four states, including Virginia, have declined to broaden their programs. The DSH payments, however, are still scheduled to be deeply cut. That means states like Virginia that refuse to accept federal money to expand Medicaid also will be losing federal dollars to help compensate hospitals for treating patients who can’t afford health insurance. The hospitals, in other words, will lose revenue. Saslaw told us his comments were based on an article this April in Governing, a national magazine directed towards elected officials and bureaucrats. But contrary to Saslaw’s assertion, the story didn’t estimate that 40 percent of the rural hospitals would shut down in states that don’t expand Medicaid. What it said is that more than 40 percent of the rural hospitals nationwide are "operating in the red," according to the National Rural Health Association, and those located in states that don’t broaden Medicaid may see their financial problems worsen. We asked the association if it’s made any predictions on the percentage of rural hospitals that will close in states that don’t expand Medicaid. "We don’t have an estimate or a guess on that," said Lindsey Corey, the group’s communications and marketing director. During a subsequent second conversation we had with Saslaw, he acknowledged he "misread" the article. Our ruling Saslaw says Governing magazine has estimated that 40 percent of rural hospitals will close in states that don’t expand their Medicaid rolls. The magazine article didn’t make that dire prediction and neither did the health organization that’s quoted in the story. What they said was that 40 percent of rural hospitals are running in the red and those located in states that don’t broaden Medicaid eligibility may see their problems exacerbated. No doubt, many rural hospitals face significant challenges. But Salsaw, who admits he erred, misstated the peril to his advantage in arguing for Medicaid expansion. We rate his statement False.

pomt-02006	In February, John McCain "suggested" the Bergdahl-Taliban swap that he now calls "outrageous and dangerous."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/10/rachel-maddow/maddow-mccain-was-bergdahl-swap-he-was-against-it/	For the moment, the Obama administration is losing in the court of public opinion for its decision to release five Taliban prisoners in exchange for American serviceman Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The Pew Research Center and USA Today report that 43 percent of Americans say it was the wrong thing to do while 34 percent say it was the right move. There’s no question where Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stands. Right after the deal was announced, McCain called it ill-founded. "It is a mistake and it is putting the lives of American servicemen and women at risk and that to me is unacceptable," McCain said at a Republican news conference June 3. On CNN’s State of the Union on June 8, McCain affirmed he would never have released the five Taliban officials. "What we're doing here is reconstituting the Taliban government, the same guys that are mass murderers," McCain said. But MSNBC host Rachel Maddow criticized McCain of flip-flopping. "Sen. McCain did not think that very same exchange of prisoners would be ‘unacceptable to the American people’ when he himself suggested it in February," Maddow said on her June 4 program. In this fact-check, we examine if Maddow has it right when she says McCain gave this exchange the nod four months ago. (A hat tip here to the Washington Post Factchecker for its work on this question.) Maddow cited an interview between McCain and CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Feb. 18. Bergdahl’s fate was in the air. A day earlier the Washington Post reported that the Pentagon, White House and State Department were ready to free five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo to win Bergdahl’s release after an intercepted video of Bergdahl suggested his condition was deteriorating. Here is the exchange between Cooper and McCain: COOPER: "Would you oppose the idea of some form of negotiations or prisoner exchange? I know back in 2012 you called the idea of even negotiating with the Taliban bizarre, highly questionable." MCCAIN: "Well, at that time the proposal was that they would release -- Taliban, some of them really hard-core, particularly five really hard-core Taliban leaders, as a confidence-building measure. Now this idea is for an exchange of prisoners for our American fighting man. "I would be inclined to support such a thing depending on a lot of the details." COOPER: "So if there was some -- the possibility of some sort of exchange, that's something you would support?" MCCAIN: "I would support. Obviously I'd have to know the details, but I would support ways of bringing him home and if exchange was one of them I think that would be something I think we should seriously consider." This sort of deal was not McCain’s suggestion per se but he was okay with the concept. However, neither Cooper nor McCain named the five Taliban prisoners, and for that matter, neither did the Washington Post article from the day before. But McCain referred to a previous version of the American offer and a Reuters report from Aug. 7, 2012, that listed four of the five men that became part of the current exchange. Reuters said the U.S. wanted to "sweeten the deal" to free Bergdahl by offering Mullah Mohammed Fazl (Fazi), Noorullah Noori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Khairullah Khairkhwa. Three of those names had come up as early as 2011 as bargaining chips. In the CNN interview, McCain said he never signed off on any of those individuals. McCain sits on the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees and was familiar with who was in play when he spoke to Cooper, calling them "five really hard-core Taliban leaders." In the past week, several news organizations have taken McCain to task for backtracking on his position in February. McCain said his opinion back then hinged on details related to guarantees that the Taliban officials would not return quickly to the battlefield. Our ruling Maddow said the deal that McCain opposes today is one he suggested in February. In a key interview, McCain did say he "would be inclined to support" an exchange involving five hard-core Taliban leaders. The identities of four of those five were public knowledge and McCain sat on committees that would discuss such matters. McCain did not propose the swap but said he was ready to entertain it if it led to Bergdahl’s release. He has since said the swap would put Americans at risk, which is pretty much the same as calling it dangerous. We rate Maddow’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03476	The Pink Pony club in DeKalb County has never been cited for any violation of an ordinance or state law.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/14/pink-pony/how-well-has-pink-pony-behaved/	There are a few places you’d expect to follow the letter of the law. A house of worship, a school, a strip club. A strip club? Sure, say the owners and legal representatives of the Pink Pony club. The club’s lawyers have made such claims in recent weeks amid a legal dispute with the city of Brookhaven. In May, the Pink Pony ownership filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven’s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city announced Thursday afternoon it would not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge ruled on its legality. "Throughout the approximately twenty-two years of operation, Pink Pony has never been cited for any violation of any ordinance or state law," Pink Pony attorneys wrote in their complaint against the city. Alan Begner, the ponytailed Pink Pony attorney who’s for years represented adult entertainment establishments against local governments, made similar comments in a television interview. "The Pink Pony has been operating 22 years and has never been cited for a violation of any law or ordinance," Begner told WXIA-TV. So is their claim risqué? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d take this claim for a ride on the Truth-O-Meter. Has the Pink Pony ownership ever been cited for a violation of any state or local ordinance? What we found surprised us. In 1991, the Pink Pony opened for business just off Buford Highway near the heavily traveled corridor of I-85 and Druid Hills Road. Over the years, it’s become a bucket list item on any tour of offbeat metro Atlanta. Some rock stars hang out there after doing a show in Atlanta. A Tiger Woods paramour used part of her 15 minutes of fame performing at the Pink Pony. The Pink Pony has had its issues. In 1994, a man sued the club saying a nude dancer bit him on the face after he placed a tip in her garter belt. There are the occasional bouncer throws disorderly patron stories. Then, there was the controversial 1997 Miss Nude World International pageant. Competitor Vanessa Steele Inman said she lost because she refused to allow one of the contest coordinators to lick whipped cream off her body in a photo shoot. Her evidence that the fix was in: ballots from the Pink Pony's dumpster, which showed she had the highest score among the contestants. A jury awarded Steele $2.4 million in damages. In 2008, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the decision, leaving the exotic dancer with just $3,500 for attorney's fees, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. But Pink Pony owners have never been cited for any violations of a local or state ordinance, they say. "I don’t know if someone was arrested in a fight, but we were not arrested," Begner said in a telephone interview. Since the club opened in 1991, any law enforcement matter or issue with government involving the Pink Pony would be handled by DeKalb County. On Dec. 17, 2012, the club fell under the authority of the newly incorporated city of Brookhaven. Since the Pink Pony was under the local jurisdiction of DeKalb County for more than two decades, we contacted several agencies there to see if they could expose any violations by the club’s owners. We reached out to the DeKalb County district attorney’s office to see if it had any records of violations by the Pink Pony. Spokesman Erik Burton said they could not find any such records. PolitiFact Georgia contacted DeKalb County government, wondering if Pink Pony management had been cited for any code violations. The county’s code compliance staff reported no violations, DeKalb’s chief of public affairs, Jill Strickland, told us. We also contacted the DeKalb County Police Department. Maybe the vice squad or another division within the department conducted an operation that found evidence of wrongdoing by management. "After reviewing your request it has been determined that the DeKalb County Police Department does not have any documents that are responsive to your request," they wrote in a June 10 letter. PolitiFact Georgia also checked with some state agencies to see if they had anything that may dispute what the Pink Pony claimed. The Georgia secretary of state’s office had no records of any infractions and said the corporate renewal of Trop Inc. had not lapsed. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation looked under the Pink Pony, Trop Inc. and owner Dennis Williams and could not find anything related to the DeKalb County business. Again, we were focused on examining the claim that the club ownership -- not individual dancers or staff -- has not violated any laws or ordinances. Nothing to see here, it seems. No agency could find any record of a violation. We rate this statement True.	None	Pink Pony	None	None	None	2013-06-14T00:00:00	2013-05-13	['None']

pomt-07376	Rep. Paul Ryan's budget proposal cuts "nothing" from Medicare, Social Security or defense in the next two to three years, and "in three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/04/david-stockman/former-reagan-budget-director-says-ryans-plan-save/	President Ronald Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, has taken on a new public role calling out both Democrats and Republicans for failing to address budget deficits quickly, using spending cuts and tax increases. Democrats need to accept cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, Stockman wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed, while Republicans should accept tax increases, not only for the rich, but also for the middle class. Stockman appeared on the roundtable This Week with Christiane Amanpour on May 1 to make similar arguments. Prior to the roundtable, Amanpour interviewed Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. As the chair of the House Budget Committee, he created a broad budget proposal that the U.S. House of Representatives approved, mostly along party lines, on April 15. It's unlikely the proposal will become law; Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama oppose the plan. Stockman didn't have kind words for Ryan's outline. "I think both parties are delusional in thinking that this is a long-run problem. The Ryan plan gets the balanced budget in 2030, the fiscal hereafter. We have a here-and-now problem," Stockman said. "Now, what does Ryan do in the next two or three years? Nothing. He cuts $600 (billion) or $700 billion of spending, mostly from a small part of the budget, discretionary and the safety net, leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt." We decided to fact-check Stockman's attack on Ryan's proposal. We'll take it point by point with Truth-O-Meter rulings along the way to our final ruling. Ryan's proposal "leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years." Ryan's resolution specifically exempts current retirees and those near retirement. This means traditional Medicare would stay in place for those 55 or older. So we wouldn't see reductions in the rate of spending on Medicare until about 2022. Ryan's budget proposal as passed by the House of Representatives is only a broad outline, but Ryan's staff provided additional details of his plan to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, so that the CBO could conduct its usual fiscal analysis. The CBO reported that Ryan's plan leaves in place a number of cost-saving provisions that are part of health care reform, but those cost savings are part of current law, not new reductions. So Ryan's budget does indeed leave Medicare alone for the near-term. On this point, Stockman is on firm ground, and we rate this point True. Ryan's proposal "leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years." Ryan's "Path to Prosperity" asserts that Social Security is out of balance and in "fragile condition," but it doesn't suggest any immediate changes to the program. Instead, the proposal says the president should submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund, and that members of Congress should also be required to put forth ideas. The CBO report plainly states, "The proposal does not involve changes to Social Security." Stockman is accurate here as well, and we rate his statement True. Ryan's proposal "leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years." Ryan's budget proposal accepts cuts already proposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates but doesn't suggest additional reductions. Ryan's budget proposal uses the same numbers for defense spending as the White House's proposed 2012 budget, though Obama has since suggested additional cuts to defense. The reductions amount to $78 billion over the next five years, a small number considering defense got approximately $720 billion in 2011 alone. Ryan's budget slows the future growth of defense spending, but he doesn't actually reduce it. Ryan's proposal says explicitly that the first job of government is national defense and rejects "deep, across-the-board cuts in funding for national defense." (On this point, Ryan's proposal has attracted critics both for proposing too much and too little. A commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute says defense should be cut more, while one from the conservative Heritage Foundation says the spending isn't enough to achieve U.S. security goals.) We checked the proposal's numbers with Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research institute that focuses on defense. Even with Gates' suggested reduction, "the Department of Defense budget would not actually go down -- it would essentially stay flat (only growing with inflation) for the next 12 years," Harrison said via e-mail. We rate this part Mostly True, allowing for the fact that there are some small reductions that Ryan and the Obama administration both agree on. In three years, Ryan "does not cut one dime from the debt." As Stockman noted in his comments, Ryan's proposal does cut some discretionary spending in the short term. But it's not enough to make a dent in the public debt. Keep in mind what the debt is: It's the total of all the money we've borrowed. The deficit, on the other hand, is the yearly shortfall. So making the deficit smaller each year doesn't cut the debt. As long as annual deficits exist, the debt will grow every year. Ryan's proposal reduces deficits but it does not eliminate them until 2040, 29 years from now, according to the CBO analysis. The "Path to Prosperity" document includes projections for the public debt between 2011 and 2021, and it shows debt going up every single year. Congress is now debating an increase in the debt limit from its current level of $14.3 trillion; Ryan's budget shows the debt increasing to $16.2 trillion in 2012 and rising every year after that up to $23.1 trillion in 2021. So Stockman's right on this one, too. True. Other viewpoints We checked with Ryan's office for a response to Stockman's complaints. A spokesperson describes Ryan's plan as "common sense gradual reforms," and pointed out that it reduces deficits compared with current policy and compared with President Obama's budget. "Economic growth, combined with a real solution to rising health care costs, is the key to putting our budget on a path to balance and our economy on a path to prosperity. Tax increases kill growth, and simply cutting benefits for current seniors is not a real solution to rising health care costs," said spokesperson Conor Sweeney via e-mail. Meanwhile, we should point out that liberal critics who dislike Ryan's plan would also disagree with Stockman's critique. Short-term spending should not be reined in because it would hurt the economic recovery, they've said. Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it recently: "Why not slash deficits immediately? Because tax increases and cuts in government spending would depress economies further, worsening unemployment. And cutting spending in a deeply depressed economy is largely self-defeating even in purely fiscal terms: any savings achieved at the front end are partly offset by lower revenue, as the economy shrinks." Our ruling Whether the deficit should be reduced quickly or slowly is no doubt a debate that will continue to burn. Stockman urges a dramatic approach to cutting spending and increasing taxes quickly, while Ryan's proposal offers a more gradual approach to cutting spending, and it doesn't advocate raising taxes. Stockman said Ryan's plan "leaves Medicare totally untouched for three years, leaves Social Security totally untouched for 10 years, leaves defense totally untouched for the next three years, and then, after cutting that small amount, gives it all back by extending all the Bush tax cuts that we can't afford. ... In three years, he does not cut one dime from the debt." Stockman is factually accurate on all these points, and we rate his statement True.

pomt-11080	The Trump administration’s policy of separating families is "the same way Barack Obama did it."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/19/matt-schlapp/no-donald-trumps-separation-immigrant-families-was/	Critics of the Trump administration’s separating of families illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico have characterized the practice as a distinctly cruel feature of Donald Trump’s presidency. But some Republican commentators argue the policy is essentially a continuation of previous administrations. "You know what's ironic? It's the same way Barack Obama did it," conservative commentator Matt Schlapp said during the June 15 broadcast of Fox News' America's Newsroom. "This is the problem with all of these things, the outrage you see coming from the left. There wasn't outrage over Barack Obama separating kids from adults." While the Obama administration's immigration approach was not without controversy, it’s simply untrue to say he had a policy of separating families. Trump policy Let’s recap what the Trump administration is doing, before turning to Obama’s handling of immigration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a "zero-tolerance" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian. Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31 as a result of border-crossing prosecutions. Obama policy Immigration experts we spoke to said Obama-era policies did lead to some family separations, but only relatively rarely, and nowhere near the rate of the Trump administration. (A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the Obama administration did not count the number of families separated at the border.) "Obama generally refrained from prosecution in cases involving adults who crossed the border with their kids," said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. "In contrast, the current administration has chosen to prosecute adult border-crossers, even when they have kids. That's a choice — one fundamentally different from the choice made by both Obama and previous presidents of both parties." Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said immigration attorneys "occasionally" saw separated families under the Obama administration. "However, these families were usually reunited quite quickly once identified," she said, "even if that meant release of a parent from adult detention." In Trump’s case, family separations are a feature, not a bug, of the administration’s border policies, said David Fitzgerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies. "The family separations are not the small-scale collateral consequences of a border policy, but rather, a deliberate initiative," he added. Former Obama officials in recent interviews drew sharp distinctions between Trump’s policy and that of his predecessors. The Trump administration's current approach is modeled after Operation Streamline, a 2005 program under the administration of George W. Bush, according to Obama spokesman Eric Schultz. The key difference, he said, is that while the 2005 program referred all illegal immigrants for prosecution, it made exceptions for adults traveling with children. Jeh Johnson, Obama’s Homeland Security secretary from 2013 to the end of his presidency, said such separations occurred in rare cases, but never as a matter of policy. "I can't say that it never happened. There may have been some exigent situation, some emergency," Johnson told NPR June 9. "There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child. I can't say it never happened — but not as a matter of policy or practice. It's not something that I could ask our Border Patrol or our immigration enforcement personnel to do." Obama’s top domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, said the Obama administration briefly weighed the separation of parents from children, before deciding against it. "I do remember looking at each other like, ‘We’re not going to do this, are we?’ We spent five minutes thinking it through and concluded that it was a bad idea," she told the New York Times. "The morality of it was clear — that’s not who we are." Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said that, as a deterrent, the Obama administration began prosecuting border-crossers who had already been deported at least once. "But very few of those people crossed with children, so it didn’t become as visible an issue," he said. "There was some child separation and some pushback by immigrant advocacy groups around that, but the numbers were quite limited. "The idea of prosecuting people who cross the border illegally the first time they are caught is entirely new," he added. "So we haven’t seen children separated from their parents on anything near this scale before." The Obama administration’s immigration policy was not without controversy, to be sure. In 2014, amid an influx of asylum seekers from Central America, the administration established large family detention centers to hold parents and children — potentially indefinitely — as a means of deterring other asylees. The practice eventually lost a legal challenge, resulting in a 2016 decision that stopped families from being detained together. Schlapp told us that his claim referred to the fact that both Obama and Trump are bound by the same procedures prohibiting family detention. However, Schlapp’s full comment gives the misleading impression that Trump is essentially continuing Obama’s policy, when in fact Trump’s zero tolerance policy is quite different. Our ruling Schlapp said the Trump administration’s policy of separating families is "the same way Barack Obama did it." Obama’s immigration policy specifically sought to avoid breaking up families. While some children were separated from their parents under Obama, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a far lower rate than under Trump, where the practice flows from a zero tolerance approach to illegal border-crossings.

pomt-09232	"Texas has, now, the highest share of minimum-wage workers in the nation."	true	/texas/statements/2010/may/13/linda-chavez-thompson/texas-has-highest-proportion-workers-earning-minim/	Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, running for re-election, touts the jobs he's helped create in Texas during his eight-year tenure. His Democratic opponent, Linda Chavez-Thompson, is skeptical. "Perry and Dewhurst like to brag that while other states are hurting, Texas is creating jobs," Chavez-Thompson said May 4 to the Central Texas Democratic Forum. "But a recent report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has brought... some clarity to that, stating that Texas, now, has the highest share of minimum-wage workers in the nation." We wondered. James Aldrete, a spokesman for Chavez-Thompson, shared a March 11 news release from the bureau, which states that last year, Texas had the nation's "highest share" of workers earning at or less than the federal minimum wage. The research was limited to workers paid by the hour, not counting salaried employees or people who are self employed. Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas, confirmed that Texas ranked No. 1. Abbot, who crunched the numbers cited in the release, told us that among the states and the District of Columbia, Texas had the highest proportion of workers — 8.5 percent — earning at or below the federal hourly minimum wage. West Virgina had the second-most residents earning the minimum wage or less, at 7.8 percent, and Alabama followed at 7.5 percent. Oregon, Washington and California had the lowest percentages: less than 2 percent. (Some state laws exempt certain occupations from the minimum wage standard. In Georgia, for example, tipped employees, such as waiters, are exempt.) The federal minimum wage last increased from $6.55 to $7.25 in July 2009. Before then, in 2008, Texas ranked 7th nationally with 4.7 percent of workers earning minimum wage or less, Abbot said. That year, Mississippi had the highest share of minimum-wage hourly workers, 6 percent, followed by South Carolina (5.9) and Tennessee (5.8). Oregon had the lowest share, 0.8 percent. Across the United States in 2009, nearly 60 percent of workers — 72.6 million — were paid by the hour, according to the release, including 3.6 million earning minimum wage or less, or 5 percent of the hourly workers. In Texas, the 5.6 million employees who earned an hourly wage in 2009 represented 54.3 percent of the state's workers, including salaried employees who earn a fixed annual sum, according to the news release. Nearly 475,000 Texans earned at or less than the federal minimum wage — more than double the 212,000 who were at a 60 cents lower federal minimum wage in effect in 2008. Why did the Texas number surge? In part, because the federal minimum wage set by Congress has, too. From 1998 to 2006, as the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 an hour, the number of workers making at or below that amount declined slightly in Texas, except for a small uptick in 2003. After Congress provided for increases in the federal minimum wage in 2007, 2008 and 2009, more Texans started falling below the wage floor. Workers in 14 other states and the District of Columbia didn't fall to the minimum-wage level or below because their mandatory minimum wage exceeds the federal level. Per the bureau's latest data, Chavez-Thompson gets it right: Texas has the highest share of minimum-wage workers in the nation. Her statement is True.

pomt-06258	Says Newt Gingrich "has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/29/michele-bachmann/did-gingrich-say-he-supports-amnesty-all-illegal-i/	Former Georgia congressman and U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s rise in the Republican presidential polls has prompted some of his fellow GOP contenders to find ways to knock him off his newfound perch. U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota criticized Gingrich’s position on immigration during a television interview on the PBS program "NewsHour" the day after the Republican candidates gathered for a debate on national security issues. Gingrich made headlines for what he described during the debate as his "humane" -- and critics call his soft -- approach on immigration. "[Gingrich] has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal," Bachmann said. Bachmann then argued that Gingrich "probably has the most liberal position on illegal immigration of any of the candidates in the race." We wondered about what Bachmann claimed Gingrich said since he seemed to say something different during the Nov. 22 debate on CNN. "I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century," Gingrich said at the debate. "And I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, 'Let's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship but by finding a way to create legality so that they are not separated from their families.' " Bachmann’s campaign website has a link to an article that seems to defend her statement on PBS. The December 2010 article, on Fox Nation news website, has a quote from Gingrich using the 11 million illegal immigrant number. "We are not going to deport 11 million people," Gingrich is quoted as saying at a forum on Latino issues. "There has to be some zone between deportation and amnesty." Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond pointed to the latter part of the candidate’s quote to argue Bachmann’s claim was misleading. "Newt's quote about the need for a zone between deportation and [amnesty] is proof alone Bachmann's claim is false, an outright lie," Hammond told us via e-mail. The Fox Nation article quotes Gingrich as saying his position is "not a call for amnesty." On his campaign website, Gingrich has a 10-step plan on immigration. He talks about creating a system of committees that would determine which illegal immigrants can stay and which ones must return to their homeland. Gingrich also says illegal immigrants who are criminals and/or gang members should be deported promptly. "We need a path to legality, but not citizenship, for some of these individuals who have deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties," Gingrich wrote. "We also need a path to swift but dignified repatriation for those who are transient and have no roots in America." We sent a request for comment to Bachmann’s campaign but got no response. Bachmann defended her position in a statement she released to news outlets last weekend. CNN reported the statement included a letter signed by Gingrich and 14 other conservatives in 2004 that was published in The Wall Street Journal that supported then-President George W. Bush’s guest worker program. "The president has shown courage by calling on Congress to place reality over rhetoric and recognize that those already working here outside the law are unlikely to leave," the letter states. "Congress can fulfill its role by establishing sufficient increases in legal immigration and paths to permanent residence to enable more workers to stay, assimilate, and become part of America." Bachmann said in her statement: "I don’t agree that you should make 11 million workers legal here because that in effect is amnesty and will only encourage more illegal immigrants to come here." Gingrich -- through his comments at the CNN debate, his website and by signing the 2004 letter -- believes there are some illegal immigrants working in the United States who should be provided a path to legal status and others should be deported. He has not said all illegal immigrants working here "should be made legal." Bachmann has implied something different when she said Gingrich "has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal." She has transformed Gingrich’s nuanced statement into an all-or-nothing pronouncement. And she has done so to win favor with a sector of the GOP base opposed to any compromise on illegal immigration. We find Bachmann’s statement misleading and rate it False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-11-29T06:00:00	2011-11-23	['None']

pomt-12105	"There aren't too many people outside protesting" his speech at the Phoenix Convention Center.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/23/donald-trump/trumps-false-claim-there-werent-too-many-peop/	President Donald Trump opened his campaign rally in Phoenix noting a matter of importance to him: crowd sizes. "What a crowd," Trump said Aug. 22 about his supporters inside the Phoenix Convention Center, the site of one of his first major campaign rallies two years earlier. He immediately drew attention to another group of people: "And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you." Trump downplayed the number of protesters at other points in his 75-minute speech. But the president’s narrative was at odds with what TV news viewers had seen for hours leading up to Trump taking the stage. The coverage on national networks showed sizeable crowds out on the streets carrying signs criticizing the president and his response to the Charlottesville, Va., riots ignited by supporters of white supremacist and anti-Semitic groups. The Phoenix Police Chief also said there were "tens of thousands" of people out on the streets. Here are the facts. Trump’s touts his ‘incredible’ crowd and ‘few’ protesters As Trump delivered his speech, he sought to spotlight the people inside the convention center, asking cameras to put them on TV "because it is rather incredible." (CNN obliged.) Trump was also interrupted by a protester inside the convention center as he defended his series of responses to the violence in Charlottesville. "Don't bother, it's only a single voice. And not a very powerful voice," Trump said. "How did he get in here? He's supposed to be with the few people outside." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com (People protest outside the Phoenix Convention Center on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix. Protests were held against President Donald Trump as he hosted a rally inside the convention center. / AP) Trump suggested Phoenix’ hot weather kept protesters away. "How about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside. Where are they? Well, it's hot out. It is hot. I think it's too warm," Trump said. "You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything." "Antifa!" he shouted, the shorthand term for anti-fascists, which broadly describes far-left-leaning militant groups challenging neo-Nazis and white supremacists. The next day, Trump continued boasting about the amount of people who showed up to support him. "Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!" another tweet said. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com We did not get a response from the White House when we requested more information on Trump’s claim of few protesters. We asked the U.S. Secret Service — which Trump cited as his source of information — about their estimates of crowd sizes outside the convention center, but did not get a figure. "For operational security purposes we do not publicly discuss the methods and means on how we conduct our protective operations," said Mason F. Brayman, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the Secret Service. Local and national media reports Leading up to the rally, Phoenix police chief Jeri Williams said the department would have "maximum staffing" and emphasized its experience handling other major events, such as Super Bowls. In a press briefing after the events, Williams said there had been "tens of thousands" of people downtown. (Trump said he brought 15,000 people into the convention center. The Phoenix Fire Marshal approved capacity up to 19,000 people.) "We had tens of thousands of people downtown peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights," Williams said. "What’s unfortunate is that a very small number of individuals chose criminal conduct." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Protesters outside the Phoenix Convention Center hold up anti-President Donald Trump signs and shout back at Trump supporters waiting to enter a rally by Trump on Aug. 22, 2017, in Phoenix, Ariz. / Getty) Azcentral.com reported that demonstrators outside the convention center "largely refrained from violence" throughout the day. That changed after Trump’s speech ended and a few people threw rocks and bottles at police. Police used pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse protesters. Local media also said there were thousands of anti-Trump protesters out on the streets. Some photos show protesters held back by barricades outside the convention center where Trump was speaking. Several videos and photo galleries from local media depict the crowds of protesters, which included people advocating for immigrant rights and against hate groups. Fox News — which Trump singled out as a channel that treats him fairly — also reported that "thousands of protesters gathered outside" the convention center ahead of Trump’s speech. CNN also said thousands of protesters were in attendance. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump at a rally in Phoenix said, "There aren't too many people outside protesting." Thousands of people were out on the streets of Phoenix protesting Trump’s speech, according to multiple media accounts and the Phoenix police chief, who said the city’s downtown had "tens of thousands" of people exercising their right to free speech. Trump significantly underestimated crowds in Phoenix. We rate his statement False. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-08-23T15:31:47	2017-08-22	['None']
pomt-00625	Says "roughly two-thirds of (state) corporations didn’t pay any income tax in Virginia."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/may/27/commonwealth-institute/commonwealth-institute-says-most-va-corporations-d/	A liberal think tank says corporations aren’t paying their fair share into Virginia’s treasury. "At last count, roughly two-thirds of corporations didn’t pay any income tax in Virginia despite this being a time of record high corporate profits," the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis wrote in an April 30 blog. "That’s due in large part to the teams of accountants they deploy to exploit special tax breaks and reduce or eliminate what they owe." Virginia’s corporate tax rate has been set at 6 percent since it was created in 1972. During the tax year that ended last June 30, it pumped $757.5 million into state coffers. While that may sound like a big number, the corporate income tax is a distant third in making money for the state. The largest source of revenue comes from individual income taxes, which garnered $11.2 billion during fiscal 2014, followed by sales taxes, which brought in about $3.1 billion. We wondered if it’s true that two-thirds of the corporations doing business in the commonwealth don’t pay income taxes. Commonwealth Institute spokesman Patrick Getlein pointed us to figures compiled by the Virginia Department of Taxation for tax returns filed for 2012, the most recent year data are available. The report shows, on page 25, that of 66,862 corporate income tax filers in the state, 43,481 had no liability. That means 65 percent of corporate filers didn’t put a penny of income tax into the state treasury, as the Commonwealth Institute said. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission came with similar figures in a 2010 report on Virginia’s corporate tax system that examined 2006 filings. It found that "nearly two-thirds of corporate filers appear to have no tax liability at all." Of 74,665 corporate filers that year, 46,406 didn’t owe any income tax. All of these corporate tax figures come with caveats, however. Dormancy JLARC found that nearly 30 percent of the non-paying filers in 2006 -- 13,147 corporations -- didn’t owe income taxes because they had no financial activity in the state that year. Corporations that close in Virginia are still required to file tax statements for a period of years. When "inactive" corporations were removed from the equation, JLARC found there were 33,259 "active" corporations that paid no income tax in 2006, or about 44 percent of all the businesses that filed. Those companies may have been profitable from a business perspective, JLARC said, but were able to report a loss from a tax perspective by claiming deductions. Neither JLARC nor the Department of Taxation has an updated estimate of the number of inactive corporations in Virginia. Different types of corporations Virginia only levies its corporate income tax on "C corporations" -- businesses in which the entity, not the owners, pay the taxes. The state doesn’t apply the tax to certain types of C corporations such as banks and insurance companies, but gets money from them in other ways. Banks, for example, pay a franchise tax and insurance companies pay a premiums tax. Fewer than 10 percent of businesses in Virginia are C corporations, according to JLARC figures. The vast remainder are "pass-through" entities in which the business doesn’t pay taxes , the owners and shareholders do. This includes S corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. Biggest pay bulk The lion’s share of corporate income taxes is paid are paid by a relatively small group of highly profitable multistate businesses, JLARC said. In 2006, nearly two-thirds of corporate tax revenues was generated by 200 large companies with annual incomes exceeding $10 million, the watchdog group found. On the other hand, 93 percent of corporate filers earned less than $100,000 and they paid only 5 percent of the tax’s total revenues. Other taxes Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a pro-business think tank, said we should keep in mind that corporations are subject to other levies beyond income taxes. For example, they can owe state sales taxes on items they buy for their business, and local taxes on their property and gross business receipts. "Corporate tax income is only one part of the overall tax burden on business, and often a relatively modest share of corporate tax liability," said Walczak, a former aide to state Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg. A final note: We couldn’t find data breakdown showing the percent of corporations in each state that don’t pay income taxes. On a national level, the Government Accountability Office said in a 2008 report that 60-70 percent of U.S. corporations had no tax liability from 1998 through 2005. Our ruling The Commonwealth Institute said "At last count, roughly two-thirds of corporations didn’t pay any income tax." It’s correct that two-thirds of corporate filers wound up owing zero income tax, according to the most recent report on the issue by the state Department of Taxation and another by JLARC. Many profitable companies can avoid the levy by claiming deductions. But the institute leaves out information. Many corporations don’t pay because they’ve stopped operating in the state, yet are still required by law to file a return. JLARC, after weeding out those businesses in 2010, found that 44 percent of active corporations didn’t pay income tax. We rate its claim Mostly True.

pomt-04934	Says former Sen. George Allen voted four times to raise his own pay.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-voted-raise-his-pay-fo/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen said in a recent debate that he’s always opposed "wasteful spending" in Washington. That drew a rebuke from Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, who said Allen was a big spender when the Republican served in the Senate from January 2001 to January 2007. Kaine charged that Allen was even a beneficiary of his own Senate votes. "You voted four times to raise your own pay," Kaine said. We looked into Kaine’s charge, made at a July 21 debate in Hot Springs. The U.S. Constitution requires Congress to set its own pay. In 1789, members were paid $6 a day at the 1st Congress. Today, they receive $174,000 annually. Congress, no doubt, is sensitive to the political fallout that comes when it increases its pay. So in 1989, it approved legislation that would allow salaries to increase every year without requiring members to record a vote, as our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida have noted. Congress, that year, passed an ethics reform law that included an annual cost of living adjustment. The programmed raise was created in exchange for members not getting paid any longer for private speeches. The pay increase, based on a formula, became automatic unless Congress took a vote to stop it. During Allen’s senate term, congressional salaries rose from $145,000 in January 2001 to $165,200 in January 2007. Adjusted for inflation, the level of pay stayed declined slightly. Allen never supported a bill specifically crafted to increase congressional pay. So how does Kaine back up his claim that Allen voted four times to raise his salary? Not with votes to raise congressional salaries, as Kaine charged, but with votes Allen cast in the Senate against measures that would have prevented the the automatic raises from going into effect. This happened in three of the instances Kaine cites: *On Dec. 7, 2001, Allen voted that an amendment to prevent the annual raise from going into effect in the 2002 fiscal year was "not germane" to a defense appropriations bill pending in Senate. The amendment was defeated. *On Nov. 13, 2002, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the Homeland Security Act that would have prevented the annual raise from going into effect in fiscal 2003. *On Oct. 23, 2003, Allen voted against an unsuccessful amendment to the transportation and treasury appropriations bill, that called for stopping the annual raise for fiscal 2004. The fourth incident Kaine cites also occurred on Oct. 23, 2003, when Allen voted for the overall transportation and treasury appropriation bill that contained the congressional pay hike. The cost of the salary increase -- about $2 million -- came to just 1/450th of 1 percent of the $90 billion appropriations bill. We contacted the Allen campaign but did not receive a response that pertained to the pay raises. It should be noted that Allen didn’t always vote to kill amendments to stop the raises. In 2005, he was among 92 senators who supported an amendment to a transportation and treasury spending bill that would have stopped the cost-of-living pay hike for the 2006 fiscal year. The House, on its end, didn’t include an amendment to stop the raise in its transportation and treasury spending bill. Ultimately, the Senate amendment was stripped from the appropriations bill and the pay hike went into effect in the 2006 fiscal year. Our ruling Kaine says Allen voted four times to increase his pay in the Senate. None of the votes that Kaine cites was a simple question on whether lawmakers will increase their pay. Three of them were procedural votes in which Allen opposed amendments that would have kept an automatic, yearly cost-of-living increase from going into effect. Allen’s votes in those instances helped stop efforts to cancel the pay hikes. The fourth instance Kaine lists was not a direct vote on congressional salaries. In that case, Allen supported a massive, $90 billion transportation and treasury appropriations bill that included $2 million for an automatic, cost-of-living pay raise. Only three of the four votes Kaine cited specifically focused on congressional pay raises. So we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10050	"Obama taps porn lawyer for #2 at Justice."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/06/fidelis/obama-porn-lawyer-laid-bare/	To hear some conservative opponents talk about David Ogden, President Obama's choice for deputy attorney general, you might have expected recommendation letters to come to the Senate in plain brown wrappers. "An Obscene Choice: Obama Taps Porn Lawyer for # 2 at Justice," blares a headline atop the Web site for Fidelis, a conservative group that has waged a PR campaign against Ogden's nomination. According to a press release from Fidelis, "President Obama's Choice for Deputy Attorney General has represented Playboy, Penthouse, the ACLU and others." First some background. Yes, as a lawyer in private practice more than 15 years ago, Ogden once did legal work on behalf of Playboy, Penthouse and other adult businesses. Ogden was then a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jenner & Block, which had an active constitutional practice representing a number of media clients with First Amendment issues. In 1986, Ogden famously represented Playboy (as well as the American Council for the Blind, the American Library Association and others) when he successfully argued in federal court that the Library of Congress violated the First Amendment when it refused to fund publication of a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. The federal government pays to have many periodicals printed into Braille. Ogden was quoted in the Washington Post at the time hailing the decision as "turning the tide in the censorship battle" and saying that he hoped the printing of Braille editions of Playboy "is not an intolerable burden on the program" but was "the price of violating people's First Amendment rights." Ogden also sought an injunction to prevent the Meese Commission (a commission on pornopgraphy) from including Playboy in a potential "black list" of adult magazines. And he represented a mail-order distributor of adult videos that challenged the constitutionality of a multidistrict prosecution strategy. The Fidelis Web site documents numerous other briefs Ogden filed in obscenity cases on behalf of Playboy, the ACLU, the Amerrican Booksellers Association and others. In a news release, Brian Burch, president of Fidelis, said, "Ogden’s record is nothing short of obscene. He has represented Playboy Enterprises in multiple cases, Penthouse Magazine, the ACLU, and the largest distributor of hard-core pornography videos. He has opposed filters on library computers protecting children from Internet smut, and successfully defended the right of pornographers to produce material with underage children. "David Ogden has collected checks from Playboy and Penthouse to fight reasonable protections for parents and children from pornography. Ogden even sued the federal government in an attempt to publish Braille versions of Playboy magazine – at taxpayer expense, of course." During a hearing on Ogden's nomination on Feb. 5, 2009, several Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Ogden for nearly two hours about positions he took in some of those cases. Several asked Ogden about the Library of Congress case. "I was representing a client as a lawyer in private practice," Ogden explained. "A lawyer in private practice does not sit in judgment of his clients. His job is to present their views as persuasively and appropriately as possible." Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, challenged Ogden about arguments he once made against a law requiring producers of sexually explicit material to keep records about the identity and age of performers. "How," Hatch asked, "can we believe the Department of Justice will properly enforce this law, and if necessary defend its constitutionality when you have said for 20 years that it is unconstitutional?" Ogden said the courts have made it clear that the government has the power to require that records are kept, and he said, "I think the law is constitutional as it stands today." And he stressed that while he fought for constitutional issues in that case, it should not be interpreted that he believes obscene materials or child pornography should go unpunished or unregulated. "I want to make it very clear that the laws against child pornography are extremely important laws," Ogden said. "I think that child pornography is abhorrent. I think the efforts to exploit children is abhorrent and deserves the full sanctions of the law. And that is my strong view." Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions noted that Ogden once argued against a congressional attempt to force librarians to put a filter on computers so that children could not view pornography. Sessions said he understood that lawyers advocate for their client's position, but he wanted to know what Ogden felt about that personally. "I think it's quite important that children be protected from exposure to materials that is obscene to them," Ogden responded. "I think that's a different standard than what's obscene to adults. I think it's appropriate for parents to want to have protections with respect to those materials." Republican Sen. Jon Kyl called Ogden's attention to arguments he made against the conviction of a man found in possession of videos with girls in bikinis, or otherwise scantily clad, striking provocative poses and gyrating suggestively. A court later ruled the videos were clearly intended to pander to pedophiles. Ogden filed a brief on behalf of booksellers and library associations arguing that the videos did not constitute child pornography, that the standard ought to be nudity. They lost. Ogden said he'd have no problem enforcing the law, and that he would stand up for it if confirmed. "That was an argument made for a client," Ogden said. "As the lawyer for the United States, I will aggressively and appropriately enforce the law of the U.S. to its full letter." So that's a few highlights of Ogden's representation of the adult business. Supporters — many of them Republicans — say those cases are hardly career-defining for Ogden. Rather, they note that while head of the Department of Justice's civil division, Ogden was part of the team that defended the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996; and that he helped to defend the Child Online Protection Act of 1998. In the hearing on Feb. 5, Ogden said one of his proudest professional moments came from a brief he filed for the American Psychological Association arguing that child victims of sexual abuse sex ought to be allowed to testify via closed-circuit television due to the psychologically damaging effects of having to testify in person. For the last eight years, Ogden has worked for the law firm WilmerHale, where he is a partner and co-chair of the Government and Regulatory Litigation Practice Group. His clients include pharmaceutical, petrochemical, insurance, automotive, airline and media companies. For a more complete look at some of the work Ogden has done for WilmerHale, check out his page on the company Web site. Reginald Brown, a former Bush Administration official and current law partner of Ogden, said Ogden's work for adult businesses has been vastly overplayed. "He took some positions on behalf of interest groups that obviously the government disagreed with," Brown said. "It was by no means a majority of his practice. The bulk of his practice over the last eight years has been representing various companies — energy companies, pharmaceuticals and even some government agencies. I would describe it as a wide-ranging commercial litigation practice." As for the work for Playboy, Penthouse and other distributors of adult videos, Brown said. "The extent of that work is greatly exaggerated and is taken out of context. It's borderline libelous to suggest that David has a huge practice representing the pornography industry. That's not to say he didn't work on the cases cited." Said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama administration: "David Ogden is committed to fighting for families and children. That is why his nomination has been supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Boys and Girls Club of America, among others. While Ogden served at DOJ, he led the U.S. government’s defense of various antipornography statutes against constitutional attack, arguing forcefully against positions taken in some of those cases by former clients. He will do so again as Deputy Attorney General." We take LaBolt's point. And we think when some people hear Fidelis and others refer to Ogden as a "porn lawyer" they may assume that Ogden spent the better part of his career representing the pornography industry. That's just not the case. Ogden's work with adult-oriented companies came more than 15 years ago, and only reflects a fraction of his body of work as an attorney both in private practice and for the government. And we appreciate Ogden's point — made repeatedly in the hearing — that lawyers sometimes take a position on behalf of a client that doesn't necessarily reflect the views of the attorney. Still, it is undisputed that Ogden once did significant legal work on behalf of Playboy and other adult businesses, no matter how many years or clients ago it was. And so we rate the comment Mostly True.	None	Fidelis	None	None	None	2009-02-06T14:53:43	2009-02-03	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-07138	"It’s just crazy that the government will ... make it illegal to use the old [incandescent] bulbs."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/16/mike-stenhouse/head-ri-public-policy-group-says-federal-law-bans-/	You’ve heard the jokes before -- how many so-and-so’s does it take to screw in a light bulb? While light bulbs are remarkably simple to use, new energy efficiency mandates have complicated matters. And that has some people riled up. Appearing as a guest on WHJJ-AM’s "Helen Glover Show," Mike Stenhouse, executive director of the Ocean State Policy Research Institute, complained about federal regulations that will mean lights out for the traditional incandescent light bulb. "They’re basically telling you that the normal light bulbs that we have always used, that Thomas Edison invented, are going to be illegal, I mean, imagine that, they are going to be illegal to use and they have to be replaced," he said. He continued, "It’s just crazy that the government will make us, MAKE US, force us, make it illegal to use the old bulbs and we have to use these new ones and that is just tyranny." A light bulb went off here at PolitiFact and we wondered: Is it true that it will be illegal to use our old bulbs? " When we asked Stenhouse to shine some light on his statement, he referred us to a video of a speech on the floor of Congress by U.S. Rep.Ted Poe, R-Texas. In it, Poe hit on several of the themes that Stenhouse echoed, namely that the government is over-reaching its proper role in setting new efficiency standards for light bulbs. Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh and Tea Party leaders, have railed against the law. It turns out that our colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into similar claims -- by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates -- that old incandescents would have to be tossed out and replaced with energy efficient ones. To begin, let’s go back to 1879 when Thomas Edison invented the forerunner of the modern-day incandescent bulb. Its technology has changed little in the ensuing 132 years. Today, incandescent bulbs are used in an estimated 3 billion of the 4 billion light fixtures the country. But in recent years, with rising energy costs and growing concerns about climate change, demand for more energy-efficient lighting has gained momentum. Incandescents are terribly inefficient, with 90 percent of the energy they consume lost through heat. Responding to those concerns, then-President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which received a measure of bipartisan support in Congress. (It passed in the House 264 to 163, with 36 Republicans voting in favor, and in the Senate, 65 to 27, with 20 Republicans voting in favor. The act deals with a broad range of energy-consumption issues, including light bulb efficiency. Section 321 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring light bulbs to use 27 percent less energy than traditional incandescents. The law, while setting efficiency standards for light bulbs, does not ban or favor one type of bulb over another, according to a "backgrounder" put out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But it will, in effect, end production of traditional incandescent bulbs, beginning with 100-watt bulbs in 2012, then 75-watt bulbs in 2013 and ending with 40-watt bulbs in 2014. Halogen incandescent bulbs will meet the new standards as will still-pricey LEDs and popular and more affordable compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs. Prices today are $40 to $50 for an LED, $3 for fluorescent alternatives and $1.50 for halogen incandescents, compared with about 50 cents for a typical 100-watt incandescent. We note, by the way, that Stenhouse echoed concerns about mercury in CFLs, saying, "If you break them... your home becomes a hazardous area." But the EPA calls that a "myth," saying that "airing out and removing the bulb pieces from the room will quickly dissipate any mercury vapor." The EPA also labels as myth assertions, repeated by Stenhouse, that CFLs will raise mercury levels in the environment. The agency says coal power plants are the "main emitter" of mercury in the United States, PolitiFact National rated a claim that CFLs are "toxic" and "not environmentally friendly" as Half True. Setting aside these issues about CFLs and, more broadly the merits of the law itself, we return to the question that consumers will want answers to beginning in 2012: Will the law, as Stenhouse states, "make it illegal to use the old bulbs." While the bill sets standards for new light bulbs "manufactured or imported" to the United States, it does not address using old bulbs that don’t meet the new standards. When reached by PolitiFact National, Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said people can keep using their old incandescent bulbs and stores can continue to sell them -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out. "There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs," said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a 30-year-old advocacy organization that advises lawmakers and conducts research. Stenhouse admitted the possibility that he "might have made a little mistake there" in saying that incandescents will be illegal to use -- a statement he made at two separate points of his appearance. Also, he emphasized that his appearances as a guest of Glover, the former Survivor contestant, are part of his group’s "Liberty Bytes" program. He said the initiative encourages listeners to ask how issues reported in the news "affect your personal liberties....It’s not our research...it’s all based on media accounts." "Obviously, we were convinced that it was accurate," he said, but added, "We did not take the next step of going into the bill and looking up this stuff ourselves." We don’t think it would have taken that much research to get a simple and key fact about the bill straight. We found numerous references, including at the Department of Energy website, where a Q & A states that, "Consumers will have the choice to continue using traditional incandescent bulbs for as long as they last, or switch to more efficient bulbs." Stenhouse needn’t fret personally about which bulbs to use. There’s plenty of light emanating from his trousers. We rate this one Pants on Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-00298	Tim Kaine: "opposes everything President Trump does."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2018/sep/26/corey-stewart/stewart-close-describing-kaines-opposition-trump/	Corey Stewart, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, rarely misses a chance to link himself to President Donald Trump. On the flip side, Stewart seldom misses an opportunity to paint Sen. Tim Kaine - the Democratic incumbent - as an unflagging enemy of the president. "He opposes everything President Trump does" Stewart said during a July 21 debate with Kaine in Hot Springs, Va. "He’s automatically going to vote against anything the president does." Three other times during the debate, Stewart repeated that Kaine never supports the president. We decided to test the claim. His campaign did not respond to our request for backup information. So we turned to FiveThirtyEight, a much-quoted website that collects and analyzes statistics on politics, sports and other topics. The site keeps records of each congress member’s presidential support - the percentage of times a congress member votes in support of the president when the White House has taken a clear position on legislation. The website identifies 76 bills and resolutions on which Trump stated a position since Jan. 12, 2017 - eight days before his inauguration. Kaine cast 26 votes backing Trump and 50 votes against him. That comes to 34.2 percent support. But there are some caveats to that figure. Let’s take a deeper look. Nominations Kaine, during the debate, didn’t put up a fight when Stewart said he "opposes everything" Trump does. His response: "I have voted for many of President’s nominees, and I work with them everyday." For sure, Kaine’s agreement percentage has been buoyed by his votes for Trump nominees to certain cabinet and administrative posts. Fifteen of Kaine’s 26 votes backing Trump have been to confirm nominations. But it also should be noted that Kaine has voted against 15 Trump nominees, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Kaine said Gorsuch was an "activist" for restricting women’s health rights. Kaine voted against confirming nine of the 15 current members of Trump’s cabinet: •Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; •Attorney General Jeff Sessions; •Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar; •Secretary of Treasury Tom Mnuchin; •Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson; •Secretary of Energy Rick Perry; •Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen; •Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta; and •Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Policy If we scratch confirmations from the list, we’re left with 46 policy votes on which Trump took a stand. Kaine voted with the president on 11 occasions, or 24 percent of the time. But that doesn’t mean Kaine agreed with Trump on 11 issues. Boiled down, they were only in sync on five matters: •Avoiding or ending government shutdowns. Kaine backed the president six times on contested votes to keep the government funded; •Disaster relief. Kaine and Trump agreed on two measures that gave aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey, centered in Houston, and Hurricane Harvey, centered in Puerto Rico; •Expanding veterans access to private-sector health care at government expense; •Ending some regulations on small banks that were passed during the Great Recession; and •Continuance of a spying program that allows intelligence analysts to search, without warrant, communications between Americans and people identified as foreign threats living overseas. Conversely, Kaine has voted against the president’s policies 35 times, or 76 percent of the time. He has opposed, often repeatedly, most of Trump’s signature initiatives. For example, Kaine cast votes against Trump’s: •$1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years, saying it would mainly benefits businesses and wealthy;. •Increased tariffs; •Tough stand on immigration; and •Efforts to end or dismantle Obamacare. Kaine’s response Ian Sams, communications director for Kaine’s campaign, says the presidential support rating presents an incomplete picture of Kaine’s accordance with Trump. He acknowledged in an email that Kaine "objects to a lot" of Trump’s initiatives, but added that the senator has been pleased by the president’s signature on a number of less-publicized bills and resolutions that help Virginia. They include: •Working towards a 355-ship Navy; •Federal recognition of Virginia’s native tribes; and •Several measures that improve veteran service and benefits. Our ruling Stewart says Kaine "opposes everything President Trump does." It’s a greatly hyped statement. Kaine doesn’t oppose every Trump action. When Trump has stated a position on legislation, records show Kaine has voted in support of him 34.2 percent of the time. Most of these votes have been on nominations. Not included in the calculation are a number of little-known bills and resolutions helping Virginia that Kaine backed and Trump quietly signed. But Stewart’s larger context - that Kaine fundamentally disagrees with Trump - is correct. Kaine has voted against confirming most of Trump’s major nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch and 9 of the 15 people now in the president’s cabinet. Kaine has also voted against Trump’s defining initiatives on tax reform, immigration, health care and tariffs. He’s clearly opposed Trump most of the time on major issues. So we rate Stewart’s statement Mostly True.	None	Corey Stewart	None	None	None	2018-09-26T11:57:19	2018-07-21	['None']

pomt-06277	Dem-controlled Ohio House voted "to change the process, to create objective criteria, to modify the Constitution" ... to "take politics out of the efforts to draw legislative boundaries."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/23/armond-budish/armond-budish-says-dem-controlled-ohio-house-passe/	Redistricting – the once-a-decade responsibility of redrawing Ohio’s congressional districts – has lived up to its reputation as a partisan battle that tends to serve the interests of the party in power. Republican lawmakers, with majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, were in control of drawing the new map this year. The map, approved in September, has 12 solid Republican districts and four Democratic-leaning districts. Unable to vote it down, Democrats have fought back with a referendum effort that threatens to block the new map from taking effect. The potential chaos brought on by the referendum effort opened up negotiations to draft a revised map that would please both parties. But House Republicans did not support a revised congressional map that Democrats proposed earlier this month. In a news conference Nov. 3, 2011, to discuss the negotiations over the congressional district boundaries, House Democratic Leader Armond Budish acknowledged the process is flawed, and told reporters that House Democrats had tried to fix it when they still were in the majority last year. "We passed a resolution out of the House on a bipartisan basis to change the process, to create objective criteria, to modify the Constitution so that going forward we would take politics out of the efforts to draw legislative boundaries," Budish told reporters. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Did Democrats really try to fix the process for drawing district boundaries? Budish was referring to House Joint Resolution 15, a proposed constitutional amendment to establish a less partisan way that boundaries are drawn. But there’s a catch. That resolution addressed the process for Ohio’s legislative districts – not the state’s congressional districts. The processes for drawing the two maps are similar – neither requires bipartisanship for adoption – yet they have very little to do with one another. Lawmakers are responsible for passing a congressional map. But the state’s Apportionment Board decides the boundaries for the 99 districts of the House of Representatives and 33 Senate districts. The Apportionment Board is made up of the governor, auditor, secretary of state and two legislative leaders of opposing parties. In early October, the five-member board finalized the new legislative districts, which favor Republicans. HJR 15 serves as no proof that House Democrats tried to fix the process last year when they controlled the House. The joint resolution only would have changed the apportionment process. It would not have altered the congressional mapping process, which is the source of the current controversy. In fact, a plan to revise both apportionment and congressional redistricting passed the Senate in 2009 and sat idle in the House. Budish was House speaker and Democrats held the majority that year, also. Secretary of State Jon Husted, then a member of the GOP-controlled Senate, was the primary sponsor of the plan, which altered the makeup of the Apportionment Board and required boundaries to be drawn so that both state legislative and congressional districts are competitive and compact. Rather than take up Husted’s plan, House Democrats crafted their own, HJR 15. After the House passed HJR 15, there were talks about merging it with Husted’s plan. But Husted, a Republican, said House Democrats did not want to change the congressional redistricting process. "They never did anything on the congressional map; it was a nonstarter," Husted said. Keary McCarthy, Budish’s chief of staff, said House Democrats, in fact, did consider the inclusion of congressional redistricting in the merger with Husted’s plan. McCarthy provided a draft of legislation showing that Democrats were willing to include congressional redistricting while they were in discussions with Husted to reach a compromise. Ultimately though, noplan was able to pass in both chambers. So where does that leave us? Budish’s specified that House Democrats worked to fix the system for redrawing legislative districts. And the news conference at which he spoke was clearly called to address congressional redistricting. Yet Democrats specifically left out congressional redistricting from the proposal that cleared the House. Even if their plan, HJR 15, had won Senate passage and was approved by voters as an amendment to the Ohio Constitution, it would have had no impact on the congressional redistricting process that currently is mired in chaos. "The issue of controversy now is the congressional map," Husted said. And Budish clearly knows the difference between redistricting and apportionment. He was the lone Democrat on the Apportionment Board. Budish’s statement is not accurate. The legislation he cites would not have addressed congressional redistricting. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement False.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2011-11-23T06:00:00	2011-11-03	['None']
pomt-13471	Chris "Sununu supported Obama’s Common Core agenda, taking away local control of our schools."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/12/ted-gatsas/republican-candidate-governor-ted-gatsas-says-oppo/	School choice has become a contentious issue in New Hampshire’s race for governor. With four Republicans locked in a close primary fight, it’s an issue that could make a difference on Tuesday. Republican Ted Gatsas took aim at rival Chris Sununu in a recent ad, saying Sununu supported Common Core education standards. "In Concord, Sununu supported Obama’s Common Core agenda, taking away local control of our schools," a narrator says in the ad titled "Sununu's Liberal Record," that began airing at the start of September. We decided to take a look. Gatsas’ claim contains several assertions that we can break down one-by-one. First, whether Sununu supported Common Core; second, whether Common Core takes away local control; and third, whether Common Core was Obama’s initiative. Sununu’s support The Common Core standards are a set of benchmarks for English and math developed after years of discussion between state education departments and non-governmental groups. The aim was to prepare pupils for college-level work and careers, and to make sure students in different states across the country were learning the similar things in school. Gatsas’ campaign pointed us to several votes Sununu took as an Executive Councilor. The five-member council is charged with approving state contracts over $25,000 and voting on the governor’s judicial and commissioner appointments. In one instance, Sununu voted with the council’s majority to approve a retroactive contract with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium to test students. That vote was to extend an existing contract with the University of California-Los Angeles for $603,000 to develop the Smarter Balanced assessment tests, based on the Common Core standards. Gatsas’ campaign also pointed to Sununu’s confirmation votes for Education Commissioner Virginia Barry and two members of the state’s board of education. Barry was confirmed to another four-year term in 2013 by a unanimous vote. She has been supportive of the standards, saying in 2014 they "raise the bar in our state with regard to teaching and learning." So Sununu voted in favor of education officials and a testing contract. This shows a degree of support for Common Core, but these votes are not the same as up or down votes on Common Core itself. Obama’s initiative? Gatsas also ties the initiative to President Obama, a connection Politifact has examined before. Common Core’s website explicitly states that the federal government was not involved in developing the standards. Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards. Claims that Common Core is Obama’s doing have been found False or Mostly False. As PolitiFact Florida noted, the Council of Chief State School Officers -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. The Obama administration has used an education grant process called Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Local control While Common Core sets standards, the decisions about what books teachers should use to meet the standards are decisions made at the state and local level. In fact, federal law predating Common Core prohibits "an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s curriculum..." So far, 42 states have agreed to use Common Core, with varying degrees of actual support. Minnesota only chose to use the English standards. South Carolina, Indiana and Oklahoma initially agreed to use Common Core, but have since withdrawn. Our Ruling Ted Gatsas said that Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican, supported "Obama’s Common Core Agenda." As an Executive Councilor, Sununu voted in favor of testing contracts and education officials aligned with Common Core, which shows a degree of support, but he has never taken an up-or-down vote on the Common Core standards. And, while Obama’s administration has incentivized states to adopt the standards, the federal government did not develop them, nor do the standards micro-manage how New Hampshire schools should deliver education. This statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08644	Ed Schultz said Alan Grayson is "what it's all about."	true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/16/alan-grayson/was-msnbcs-ed-schultz-talking-about-alan-grayson-g/	With friends like Oliver Stone, it's no surprise Alan Grayson is blitzing Central Florida airwaves with glitzy, Hollywood-style campaign ads. Grayson, a Democrat considered vulnerable in his re-election campaign against former Florida House Speaker Dan Webster, is airing a series of ads called "When They Lie." The couple of ads we've seen are slightly different, but all follow a simple pattern. The screen flashes black and white images of conservative figures like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter. Then, MSNBC's Ed Schultz, looks directly into the camera and shouts, "This guy is what it's all about." Next the movie action music ramps up along with images from around the world, mixing in messages in black and white, like "Vote Truth," "Vote Grayson," or "When They Lie," "Vote Grayson." The ads certainly are different, but we wanted to check the one real line included, the quote from liberal commentator Ed Schultz. Viewers have been tricked before by splicing together snippets of television, and in this case, the rest of the images in the ad have almost nothing directly to do with Grayson. So we wondered if the impression the ad leaves -- that Schultz is talking specifically about Grayson -- matches reality. Grayson, whom Democrats love because he's so blunt and Republicans hate because he's so blunt, took to the House floor Sept. 29, 2009, to detail what he called the Republicans' plan for health care. "The Republicans' health care plan for America ... don't get sick," Grayson said, with a simple white poster board proclaiming the same message. "That's what the Republicans have in mind for you, America." But, Grayson added, Republicans recognize that plan isn't foolproof and said the GOP had a backup plan. "If you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is die quickly," Grayson added. "The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick." Conservative Republicans demanded an apology for the "die quickly" comment while liberal Democrats praised Grayson. Among the chorus of praise: Schultz, one the country's more prominent liberal pundits. On his Oct. 1, 2009, MSNBC show, Schultz interviewed Grayson about his comments and referred to Grayson as the "new lefty hero on the block." Here's one exchange between the two, according to an transcript: Schultz: Congressman, do you take anything back? I mean, are we going to see more of this? Grayson: Absolutely not. The people who should be apologizing are the Republicans. They're the ones who should apologize for dragging us all through the mud here while we're just trying to improve health care in America. That's all we're trying to do. Schultz: Now, the thing I liked about it is that you had charts. I mean, this was planned out. You must have known that this was going to kick up a lot of dust. Did you fire and fire for effect? Grayson: Listen, Ed, we've got to get past this point where everything is stalled, where the Republicans are winning just through inertia. We have a majority. We have to use it. We have to change America. That's the promise that President Obama made. We have to keep it. After nearly an eight-minute interview, Schultz wraps the segment up with his own take on Grayson, and the political impact of his comments. "For all of the hooey and the prognostication that's going on out there about the midterms -- 'Oh, Grayson's doing this, he might hurt the Democrats in the midterms' -- the hell with that," Schultz said (about 7:55 in). "This guy is what it's all about." The end of the full quote is the line in the Grayson ad -- Schultz is specifically talking about Grayson. For the record, Grayson did apologize for his comments. Sarcastically. Here was part of that apology. (Video here.) "Well, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize to the dead, and here's why. According to this study, 'Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,' which was published two weeks ago, 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. So I call upon the Democratic members of the House. I call upon the Republican members of the House. I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America, for the sake of those dying people and their families. I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America." In his new Hollywood-style ad, Grayson uses a quote from a charged-up Schultz that suggests Grayson is "what it's all about." Grayson clips the full quote -- and omits the suggestion that some think Grayson's antics could hurt Democrats in the 2010 elections -- but Schultz is indeed talking about Grayson, according to transcript and video. We rate the claim True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-09-16T17:59:38	2010-09-03	['Ed_Schultz', 'Alan_Grayson']
pomt-13118	"Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween."	false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/03/todd-starnes/todd-starnes-says-university-texas-students-advise/	Conservative commentator Todd Starnes recently wrote: "Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween." Starnes went on: "Telling a Texan not to wear cowboy boots is like telling Colonel Sanders not to fry chicken." Dern tootin’. And did UT-Austin tell students not to don cowboy hats or boots? Some guidance went to students in advance of Halloween 2016, we confirmed. But those nudges didn’t single out cowboy hats and boots. Starnes said in his Oct. 28, 2016, opinion piece posted by Fox News that he learned of the advice about hats, boots and other no-no’s from a story posted the same day by the College Fix, a conservative student-written website. Its story opened: "Leave your cowboy boots and Hawaiian leis at home this Halloween unless you want to hear from University of Texas-Austin administrators." Like other accounts including a subsequent Houston Chronicle news story and a blog post on the Austin American-Statesman website, the story included a web link to what's described as the relevant checklist for UT students. An introduction to that checklist, titled "Costume & Theme Selection," states: "You don’t have bad intentions, but your social theme or costume idea could have a negative impact. Themes and costumes may intentionally or unintentionally appropriate another culture or experience." Hunting for mentions of hats and boots, we saw that at the bottom of the second page, under "Harmful Themes and Costumes," the document lists: --Any time you paint or tint your skin in an attempt to appear to be a different skin tone, race, or culture (e.g., Blackface) --Generalized representation/stereotypes of Asian cultures --’Cowboys and Indians’/anything ‘Squaw’ or generalized depiction of an indigenous person or peoples The list of discouraged themes or costumes goes on to specify eight other questionable themes. But the mention of "cowboys and Indians" was the closest reference to cowboy hats or boots, as far as we could tell. Starnes, speaking by phone in response to our inquiry, told us he "extrapolated" his statement about the university advising against cowboy boots and hats solely from the "cowboys and Indians" admonition. On behalf of the university, administration spokesman J.B. Bird responded to our inquiry by saying the pages highlighted in news accounts fail to note a preceding page in the presentation. Bird then pointed us to UT’s post of a full copy of the guidelines showing that a three-paragraph statement on the first page says the "voluntary guidelines" are intended "to educate students about costume and party theme selection." That opening section continues: "UT Austin does not place limits on students' freedom of expression. We do not regulate their speech or enforce costume guidelines as rules. Our philosophy is to educate students and remind them that they are accountable to each other and that their actions can negatively impact other members of the university community. "We offer these voluntary guidelines in that spirit," the section closes. We asked Bird if the "cowboy/Indian" mention might reasonably be read to deter students from donning cowboy boots or hats on Halloween. Negative, Bird said by phone, in part because nothing there or elsewhere in the guidelines explicitly counsel against simply wearing such hats or boots. For a student perspective, we reached Will Deer, a senior who told us he’s close to ending a one-year term as the student president of the University of Texas Interfraternity Council, which oversees 29 fraternity chapters. By phone, Deer said he personally sees the guidelines as mandates that help ensure student events are culturally appropriate. "That’s because I am a representative for the entire IFC community," he said. But by his read, Deer said, the "cowboys and Indians" portion of the guidelines speaks solely to party themes the university would advise against. Commentator Starnes' claim specific to hats or boots, Deer said, "kind of took that out of context. It’s incorrect." "The culture here in Texas is cowboy boots and cowboy hats," Deer said. Our ruling Starnes wrote: "Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween." Voluntary student guidelines distributed before Halloween 2016 listed "cowboys and Indians" among potentially harmful themes or costumes to avoid. However, the administration’s advice didn’t stretch to counseling students not to wear cowboy boots or hats. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05939	"We balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/27/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-revises-claim-balanced-budgets-impro/	During the Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Fla., on Jan. 26, 2012, Newt Gingrich reiterated a talking point we several times have rated False. But this time, he tweaked the language. Responding to a comment from Rick Santorum about fiscal responsibility, Gingrich said, "When we balanced the budget with the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets, we doubled the size of the National Institutes of Health because we set priorities. It is possible to do the right things in the right order to make this a bigger, richer, more exciting country." We thought we’d see whether his new wording about the balanced budget was more accurate. Previously, we rated these statements by Gingrich: • "When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets." (Republican presidential debate, Tampa, Jan. 23, 2012) • "I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt." (Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Dec. 15, 2011) • "For four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt." (video announcement that he would run for president, May 11, 2011) All earned a rating of False because Gingrich was taking credit for two budgets that he had no role in assembling or shepherding through the House. As we explained in our earlier articles, Gingrich served as speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. While the federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- came when Gingrich was long gone from the House. In the Jacksonville debate, however, Gingrich modified his statement. This time, he said that the nation "ultimately had four consecutive balanced budgets." That is a more accurate way of putting it. His phrasing in Jacksonville was less boastful than some of his previous claims, such as the one in which he said, "I balanced the budget for four straight years." In Jacksonville, he credited a piece of legislation passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic president. But he glossed over a pair of tax-raising bills that made a difference, and that Gingrich opposed, including the 1990 budget deal (in which President George H.W. Bush broke his "no new taxes" pledge), and the 1993 budget vote, which cost many Democratic lawmakers their seats in the 1994 Republican landslide. "Like most things in life, what caused the budget to be balanced was multi-factorial, most important of which was the tech boom and the surging economy," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "You can partially credit the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, but you could also credit the 1993 and 1990 bills that Speaker Gingrich opposed. It's a little too simple to say that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act ‘balanced the budget.’ " In fact, when a pro-Gingrich super PAC claimed in an Iowa ad that "Newt balanced the federal budget," we rated the statement Half True for this reason. "The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong," Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us at the time. "I don’t think either party had much to do with that." Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, added that "it happened on his watch, but it doesn’t mean that he gets credit for it. The only thing you can give him credit for is stalling some additional spending programs." Our ruling At the Jacksonville debate, Gingrich was more accurate than he's been in the past and his chronology of the law and the four budgets is correct. But he oversimplifies the causes of the balanced budget. His words are accurate but need additional information, which makes this a Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47fe4a11-e312-476d-92c4-a6fb4d33a0e2	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-27T14:47:14	2012-01-26	['None']
pomt-02655	"I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature"	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jan/14/marilinda-garcia/nh-state-rep-marilinda-garcia-says-shes-cut-spendi/	The cornerstone for any Republican seeking to be the next U.S. Representative for New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District is to come across as an authentic, fiscal conservative. And soon after Salem Republican state Rep. Marilinda Garcia announced that she would enter the Second District race, she touted her cost-cutting chops. "I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature and will take that much-needed experience to Washington," Garcia, 30, declared in one of her first post-announcement statements on her Twitter account. The Telegraph and PolitiFact New Hampshire sought to determine the accuracy of that statement. State budget votes Garcia was first elected to the New Hampshire House in 2006 and was a backbencher when Democrats took control of the 400-member body for the first time in nearly a century. Garcia lost her reelection bid in 2008, but quickly won her seat back in a 2009 special election. Initially, Garcia served on the House Children and Family Law Committee, the panel that oversees divorce, adoption and custody but has essentially no direct impact on state spending matters. Claiming to cut spending is a pretty broad statement, but we’ll start with the major vote New Hampshire legislators take to increase or cut spending -- consideration of the state’s biennial budget. When Garcia was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2007, the state budget set by her fellow Republicans was $9.3 billion. The subsequent $9.7 billion budget, called for a 4 percent increase for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was written primarily by Democrats. Garcia voted against it. The next $11.5 billion budget, also written by Democrats, called for a hefty 19 percent increase in spending for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Garcia also voted against that. And the next state budget, crafted by conservative Republicans, including Garcia, after the GOP took over the chamber, cut back spending by more than a billion dollars to $10.3 billion. That budget plan was the first reduction in absolute dollars since World War II. Garcia voted in favor of that budget. Finally, the most recent $11 billion budget, covering fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and written by a Democratic majority, restored some of the cuts made in the previous budget. Garcia again voted no, though she said he didn’t mind restoring cuts to higher education, public safety and programs for troubled children. "I thought with existing recovery of revenues we could add back some of those items," Garcia said in response to our inquiry about her record of cutting spending. Instead, she said she voted against it because of the removal of the Certificate of Need program that approves all construction projects for hospitals. "I wanted to see those health care reforms in place, but they got taken out, so that's why I voted against it," Garcia said. Still, her budget votes while in the House are fairly consistent: She’s voted against every budget that called for an increase in spending and supported the one that cut spending. Other spending Reviewing Garcia’s entire, seven-year voting record and the bills she sponsored, Garcia consistently supported policies that would cut spending and taxes. In 2011, she voted to cut the taxes on hotel room rentals and meals and tobacco. She endorsed making it easier for local governments to adopt spending caps and supported banning higher-education spending on New Hampshire Public Television. Last year she opposed raising state taxes on gasoline and tobacco. In addition, in 2011, Garcia voted for a bill to require agencies propose every two years how they would live with 10 percent cut in state spending. And in 2012, Garcia voted in favor of business tax breaks totaling more than $10 million a year. She did vote in favor of one bill that could have increased spending at the local level. She voted for House Bill 1305 in 2012 that would have reinstated an exemption from property taxes for telephone and communication company poles and conduits. Critics said this could have led to raising local property taxes $5 million to $6 million statewide to make up the difference. The GOP-led House killed the bill 166-133, with Garcia on the losing end. Does she deserve credit for cutting spending? When politicians claim credit for something that happens on their watch, we consider whether that credit is justified before we give the statement a Truth-O-Meter rating. In Garcia’s case, she is a legislator, not an executive, so she can’t unilaterally cut spending. And much of the time, she has been in the minority. However, during the one session in which she served in the majority, she can make a plausible claim for deserving credit for lower spending. In April 2011, then-House Speaker William O'Brien, a Republican, appointed Garcia to the House Finance Committee. She served on the committee when the state faced an $800 million budgetary hole caused by overly optimistic revenue projections. "We solved it not by raising taxes but by cutting in a responsible way," Garcia said. At least one fellow Republican agrees. Former House Chief of Staff Gregory Moore said that "when it comes to budgets, there are three kinds of legislators: Those who believe in smaller government, those who believe in more government and those who are pragmatic on the question from issue to issue. From the outset, Marilinda Garcia came from the first camp." Our ruling Garcia said, "I cut spending while serving in the state Legislature." Her voting record on the state budget -- which comprises any legislator’s biggest impact on state spending -- show that Garcia voted against every budget that increased spending and voted in favor of the O’Brien budget that cut state spending for the first time since World War II. We found two minor asterisks. Even though she voted against the most recent state budget, she didn’t oppose it because it increased spending -- she opposed it because of how it treated a program that governs hospital construction and expansion. And she supported a bill on telephone and communication company poles and conduits that would have had the effect of raising taxes. Still, there are few, if any, votes she’s taken that would have increased spending or increased the size of government. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-13583	"NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has been a disaster for Pennsylvania."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/18/donald-trump/real-impact-nafta-pennsylvania-vs-donald-trumps-cl/	Donald Trump sees his path to the White House winding through Pennsylvania. He’s campaigned in the state many times, largely in the so-called T-section away from Philly and Pittsburgh, and gone so far as to say the only way he’ll lose Pennsylvania is if the election is rigged (not true). On most of his stops, Trump touts his message of getting jobs back for blue-collar workers who have seen their livelihoods taken away because of the decline of American manufacturing. In a recent interview with Johnstown television station WJAC, Trump emphasized a specific cause for the plight of these Pennsylvanians, saying, "NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has been a disaster for Pennsylvania." There’s no doubt manufacturing has taken a hit in Pennsylvania, as it has in the rest of the country the last 20 years. But how much of the blame can be attributed to this free-trade agreement? And were the job losses offset by gains for the state’s economy in other ways? First, a quick explanation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was signed into law in December 1993 and took effect in January 1994. NAFTA created an open trade zone among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Critics say it led to trade deficits and job losses because United States factories closed and moved to Mexico, where labor is cheaper. Proponents say despite the trade deficits, it led to improvements for consumers and new jobs and that its job loss effects are overstated. Robert E. Scott, senior economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, has studied the trade agreement’s effects extensively. His 2011 paper found 682,000 jobs had been displaced because of NAFTA. In Pennsylvania, the number was 26,300, about .5 percent of the state’s entire employment. Further, Scott said the pact paved the way for future free trade agreements. "It played a disproportionate role," he said, "in that every trade agreement after has been based on it." Scott’s views on this are rare among economists. In 2015, the Congressional Research Service, Congress’ nonpartisan think tank, concluded NAFTA had relatively little effect on American jobs one way or the other and that many of the changes America has experienced since 1994 would’ve happened anyway as trade liberalization continued to occur in other ways. Mauro Guillen, professor of international management at Wharton, said the loss of manufacturing jobs has more to do with technology and the way the economy has changed in the United States and Pennsylvania with a greater emphasis on education and health care. "Studies look at particular factories and decisions to open somewhere else like in Mexico," Guillen said. "Well that is certainly the case. What they don’t do in those studies is take into account how many jobs are being created because American firms have access to foreign markets. "What [Trump is] doing is oversimplifying a very complex question." Even before Trump, NAFTA’s effects on Pennsylvania were a 2008 election topic. As Trump is doing now, Barack Obama attacked Hillary Clinton over her support for NAFTA in spring 2008. Back then, Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute argued Pennsylvania had gained because of NAFTA. He wrote Pennsylvania’s exports to Canada and Mexico since NAFTA had increased by 61 percent and 81 percent, respectively. Pennsylvania sends more exports to Canada than any other country. In a phone interview, Reynolds said the main industries affected by NAFTA were not major industries for Pennsylvania, such as glassware, furniture, brooms, footwear and some farming. Yet there’s no doubt Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector has been gutted since 1994. Reynolds attributed the problems to technology and pointed out even China and Mexico had seen declines in their number of manufacturing jobs. There’s another culprit, too, one Trump also loves to talk about: China. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, Pennsylvania’s manufacturing sector saw a loss of 20,000 jobs between 1994 and 2001, the first few years after NAFTA. The annual losses weren’t much higher than the national average of manufacturing job loss America had been experiencing since the early 1980s. Job losses accelerated greatly starting in 2001, after China was accepted into the World Trade Organization. Manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania went from 856,000 in 2001 to 655,000 at the end of 2007, before the recession. After bottoming out at 557,000 in January 2010, Pennsylvania has about 568,000 manufacturing jobs now. "The use of disaster," Scott said, "that’s a pejorative that’s up to the viewer. I would say China and NAFTA if I were telling the story. That’s the difference." Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. What most everyone who has studied the effects of trade can agree upon is there has been a lack of action taken to better equip displaced workers to fit into the current economy. "We can’t just let them go jobless and suffer," Guillen said. "We do need public policy to help." Our Ruling While talking about the plight of Pennsylvania’s blue-collar workers with Johnstown station WJAC, Donald Trump said, "NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has been a disaster for Pennsylvania." Consensus among economists is job losses because of NAFTA were minimal, though Robert E. Scott’s study showed Pennsylvania losing 26,300 jobs because of it. Either way, "disaster" is a particularly explosive word that doesn’t take into context the winners and losers from the policy. The thousands of job losses that may be attributable to NAFTA were offset statewide by increased exports from Pennsylvania and new jobs in other parts of the economy. Besides, most economists agree China has had a much more negative effect on American labor than NAFTA. We rule the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09271	"By registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents."	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/29/marco-rubio/crist-faces-uphill-battle-find-votes-independent/	Marco Rubio, now the presumptive Republican nominee for Florida's open U.S. Senate seat, says Republican -- scratch that -- no-party candidate Gov. Charlie Crist can't win in November. Rubio advisers Todd Harris and Heath Thompson assessed the dynamics of a three-way election between Rubio, Crist and Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek in an April 28, 2010 campaign memo that was shared with the media. The memo outlines the hurdles facing Crist's no-party candidacy. Harris and Thompson wrote that Crist will have trouble raising money and organizing a ground campaign now that he lacks the support of a major party. Florida's voter registration numbers, Harris and Thompson wrote, are also squarely against "the people's" candidate. Harris and Thompson wrote: There are two great myths about Independent voters in Florida 1. There are lots of them. 2. They are all politically moderate. Neither of these is true. In reality, by registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents. And that number is even smaller when based on actual turn out percentages. With Crist's announcement on April 29 that he would run with no party affiliation, we wanted to assess if the Rubio campaign's voter statistics. The Florida Division of Elections maintains voter registration statistics for the entire state, and publishes updates on its website. The latest report comes from February 2010. According to that report, Florida currently has slightly more than 11 million registered voters. Of them, 3.97 million are registered as Republicans (36 percent), and 4.62 million are registered as Democrats (42 percent). That leaves 2.47 million people that are registered as a member of a minor political party, or registered to vote with no party affiliation. That math means that 22 percent of voters who are something other than a registered Republican or Democrat. You can see the registration statistics for yourself here. In their memo, Harris and Thompson use a capital "I" to describe independent voters, which traditionally means the Independent Party. But we're assuming they actually meant third party or no party voters. The two major Independent parties -- the Independence Party of Florida, and the Independent Party of Florida -- make up 2 to 3 percent of all registered voters. The lion's share or non-Republican or Democrat voters are registered as no party affiliation (19 percent). Harris and Thompson wrote that with Democrats now thinking the Senate race can be competitive, and Rubio consolidating a corps of conservative voters, it will very difficult for Crist to find enough support -- even though his threshold to win in November could be as low as 34 percent of the vote. "Marco and Meek will have the wherewithal to become better known," Rubio's advisers wrote. "Republicans will react to Charlie’s switch. Democrats will be introduced to Meek. And voters from both parties will begin to gravitate back to their respective camps. "Furthermore, Independents really only know one candidate right now," they wrote. "And that’s not going to remain true for very long either." Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who ran Barack Obama's winning Florida campaign, said for Crist to win he'll need to get roughly 50 percent of third party and no party voters as well as 30-to-35 percent of the vote in both major parties. "The independent vote in Florida isn't as big as some people think," Schale wrote on his blog. Back to the Rubio campaign's claim. His advisers said that "by registration fewer than 20 percent of Florida voters are Independents." That's certainly true if you're only counting the state's Independent parties, but more importantly, it's also true for voters who list no party affiliation. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01050	Since Rick Perry became governor, "poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/22/democratic-national-committee/democratic-group-says-texas-poverty-exceeding-nati/	As Rick Perry delivered his last gubernatorial speech to state legislators, the Democratic National Committee suggested the state is worse off thanks to the Republican’s long tenure. Part of a Jan. 15, 2015, email blast from the committee said: "Since Perry took office, poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average." That so? A committee spokeswoman, Miryam Lipper, told us by email the cited figures come from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, Lippert said, 15.1 percent of Texans were living below the federal poverty threshold; in 2013, she said, 17.5 percent of Texans were living in poverty. Perry, initially sworn in as governor in late December 2000, yielded the office to Greg Abbott, previously the Republican state attorney general, on Jan. 20, 2015. And Lipper guided us to a September 2013 bureau report stating that nationally according to the bureau’s 2000 American Community Survey, 12.2 percent of the U.S. population (33.3 million people) had income below the poverty level. A chart in the report says an estimated 15.1 percent of Texans, 3,056,244 residents, lived in poverty in 2000. Lipper also noted a September 2014 bureau report stating 17.5 percent of Texans, 4,530,039, lived below poverty in 2013. Nationally that year, according to the report, 15.8 percent of residents, 48,810,868 people, lived below poverty. So, the Texas poverty rate exceeded the national rate through the second-to-last year of Perry’s governorship — as it did before he took the state’s helm in 2000. The state’s poverty rate in 2013 was 2.4 percentage points higher than the year Perry became governor. Nationally, the 2013 rate was 3.6 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate in 2000. The government uses measures of poverty called "poverty thresholds" to help determine the number of residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty. Those thresholds, adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. In 2013, for instance, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $23,834. With help from a Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, we confirmed the figures cited by the Democratic group. Bernstein said, though, that the way the bureau has checked poverty levels each year changed about a decade ago; so, it’s best only to compare the results from a supplemental survey to the 2000 Census to American Community Survey results for each year since 2005. From 2005 through 2013, Texas had a greater share of residents living in poverty than the nation as a whole, ACS survey results suggest, though in all but one of the years, the gap between Texas and the nation narrowed or stayed steady. In 2013, the latest year of available estimates, 17.5 percent of Texans lived in poverty, according to the ACS, compared with 15.8 percent of U.S. residents. It could be, then, that conditions in Texas were improving as Perry approached the end of his time as governor. People in Poverty (%), U.S. and Texas, 2005 through 2013 Year U.S. Poverty Rate Texas Poverty Rate Difference (Percentage Points) 2005 13.3 % 17.6 % 4.3 2006 13.3 % 16.9 % 3.6 2007 13 % 16.3 % 3.3 2008 13.2 % 15.8 % 2.6 2009 14.3 % 17.2 % 2.9 2010 15.3 % 17.9 % 2.6 2011 15.9 % 18.5 % 2.6 2012 15.9 % 17.9 % 2.0 2013 15.8 % 17.5 % 1.7 Source: American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates, via American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Jan. 16, 2015) We also asked a University of Texas researcher, Daniel Dillon, for his analysis of changes in poverty in Texas and nationally. Dillon, citing another Census Bureau tool, the Current Population Survey, said 16.2 percent of Texans lived in poverty in 2000, the year Perry became governor, though the rate was down to 15.7 percent in his first months in office. In 2013, by that measure, 16.8 percent of Texans lived in poverty. "So to summarize, the poverty rate has gone up in TX from 15.7 to 16.8 (percent) from 2001 to 2013 (from what I’m seeing from the Census). It is important to note, however, that the overall poverty rate in the U.S. has also gone up during this time—from 11.6 in 2001 to 14.5 to 2013 (cited from the same data tables)," Dillon wrote. Dillon said the government relies on CPS results to generate official poverty estimates. A bureau web page says the CPS surveys fewer people but asks many additional questions; the ACS reaches more households with just eight income-related questions. "Neither one is right or wrong, they are just different surveys," Dillon wrote, a characterization also made to our inquiry by spokesman Oliver Bernstein of the Texas-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates programs that serve the poor. Governor’s role? We asked Dillon if Perry’s actions as governor drove the poverty rate. Dillon said it’s hard to sift out particular effects from actions by a governor. "There is decades of debate on these issues so take this with a grain of salt, but in general I think economists would say that poverty is fairly responsive to the larger economy," Dillon said. "This is especially true with downturns in the economy — economic shocks like recessionary periods have a notable effect on poverty. This happened under Perry’s term, whether he had anything to do with it or not. The same is true for growth. When the economy grows, poverty tends to decline." Also, Dillon said, it’s worth stressing that most anti-poverty efforts are undertaken by the federal government. Dillon also passed along a comment by Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, who said that generally Texas’ poverty rates will exceed national rates "because we have a large number of single parents and of Hispanics, which have high rates of poverty. That said," Osborne said, "we invest very little in our families" through state government. Our ruling The Democratic group said that since Perry became governor in late 2000, "poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average." These figures are supported by U.S. Census Bureau surveys, but they don’t tell the full story. Texas’ poverty rate went down and then up again over Perry’s decade-plus as governor, and the gap between the nation and Texas ultimately narrowed. Finally, it’s unreasonable to lay all blame for a state’s poverty rate on its governor; national economic factors dominate.

pomt-11465	Oklahoma teachers "are the poorest paid teachers in the US, in a state that gives nearly $500 million in tax handouts to energy companies."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/07/good-jobs-first/are-oklahoma-teachers-lowest-paid-nearly/	Oklahoma is drawing national attention as its teachers, often with the backing of administrators, edge toward a strike for better pay and benefits. A group that tracks corporate tax breaks chimed in on Twitter. "Oklahoma teachers are close to striking," said the Washington-based group Good Jobs First on March 6. "They are the poorest paid teachers in the US, in a state that gives nearly $500 mil in tax handouts to energy companies." We looked at both the teacher pay and tax breaks in that tweet, and, with some minor caveats, both largely check out. Scott Klinger of Good Jobs First told us the group relied on a news report that used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data we downloaded from the BLS website confirmed that in 2016, the average annual pay of Oklahoma’s elementary, middle school and high school teachers all ranked last among the 50 states. Depending on grade level, the states ranked just above Oklahoma at the bottom are South Dakota, Mississippi and Arizona. The average across all three grade levels in Oklahoma was $41,834. Nationally, the average was $59,978. Those numbers, however, included private school teachers. Data gathered solely on public school teachers for 2017 by the National Education Association, an advocacy group for public school educators, tell a modestly different story. Oklahoma’s public school teachers stood slightly above those in South Dakota and Mississippi. The NEA separated teachers into two groups, elementary and secondary. But taken together, teachers in South Dakota made $42,668, those in Mississippi made $42,925, while Oklahoma teachers made an average of $45,245. The national average was $58,950. This table compares the salaries for secondary school teachers based on the NEA and BLS data. Secondary school teachers average yearly salary NEA 2017 BLS 2016 Mississippi $42,925 Oklahoma $42,460 South Dakota $43,145 Mississippi $43,950 Oklahoma $46,217 South Dakota $44,210 The cost of living varies between states and within states. Especially for Oklahoma where a third of the population lives in rural areas, cross-state comparisons of teacher pay become tricky. We explain that in depth in this article. By and large, the most detailed comparisons include factors that go well beyond cost of living and reach the same general conclusion that Oklahoma’s teachers are among the lowest paid nationally. Oklahoma tax breaks Every two years, Oklahoma’s Tax Commission reports on tax expenditures. Those are dollars that the state didn’t collect in order to give some group or industry a leg up. For example, low-income residents get a refundable tax credit of $40, and there’s a tax break for people who buy electric cars. The tweet from Good Jobs First singled out energy companies as getting "nearly $500 million," and we found a total of $493 million in the 2016 report. The single largest amount was $402 million to investors in horizontally drilled wells. Coming in second was $29 million for drillers of new wells. A break for the costs of marketing and transporting natural gas reduced state revenues by about $14 million. Approximately $500 million is large enough to make a difference. Total annual teacher pay for the three grade levels is about $1.5 billion, or about three times the value of the tax breaks. Which says nothing about the policy implications, but the amount is enough to matter in the overall state revenue and spending picture. Our ruling Good Jobs First tweeted that Oklahoma's teachers are the poorest paid in the country. By one measure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that’s accurate. But that includes private school teachers, and the current issue of teacher pay in Oklahoma is all about contracts for those in public schools. A survey from the National Education Association that looks only at public school staff found that Oklahoma ranks third from the bottom in average teacher pay. That’s very low, but it’s not the lowest. The tweet also said the state provides nearly $500 million in tax breaks for energy companies. State data backs that up.

pomt-05889	On deporting illegal immigrants.	no flip	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/07/mitt-romney/did-romney-flip-deporting-illegal-immigrants/	In just a few weeks, Georgians will have an opportunity to choose which Republican they want to see battle President Barack Obama for the White House. The Georgia Democratic Party isn’t waiting for the March 6 state primary to weigh in on one of the Republican candidates, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Titled "Mitt Romney: Distortions," a Jan. 27 statement from the state party claimed candidate Romney wasn’t truthful on 10 subjects during a recent debate. The subject that caught our attention was immigration because it’s been such a hot topic in Georgia in recent years. "Romney claimed that he opposed ‘rounding people up and deporting them,’ " that section began. "But just last month, he stated emphatically that people who come to the United States without documentation should ‘go back home and get in line with everyone else’ -- and he has previously made clear that includes even grandparents who have been here for decades and served in their community or in the military." The former governor has faced criticism that he’s constantly shifting his stance on issues to appeal to conservative Republican voters. We wondered whether the Georgia Democratic Party was accusing Romney of changing his position on deporting illegal immigrants. Yes, its spokesman said. "It’s part of an ongoing pattern of him flip-flopping," Eric Gray said. So do Gray and the party have a point about Romney on immigration? The Democrats base their claim on a recent interview Romney did with the Spanish-language television network Telemundo before the Florida primary, saying it’s inconsistent with statements he’s made in other interviews and on the campaign stump. "[Romney] panders to Telemundo, and when he’s in front of Fox News, he says get in line with everyone else," Gray said. By some federal estimates, there are as many as 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. The federal Census Bureau estimates the U.S. population at about 312 million people. The Republican candidates have accused Obama of not being aggressive on patrolling the U.S-Mexican border. Obama has countered that he has put more agents there than any president in U.S. history. Romney has proposed efforts that would make it increasingly difficult for illegal immigrants to find work in the U.S. and encourage them to return to their homeland. During one December speech in Iowa, Romney used the language the Democrats quoted in their critique, but he did not mention deportation. "For those who came here illegally, they might have a transition time to set their affairs in order and then go back home and get in line with everyone else," he said. A Romney spokeswoman forwarded us two statements by the candidate, one made in 2007 and the other made last month, that propose similar ideas on immigration. In 2007, Romney referred to what he described as a "realistic attrition program." "If they, for instance, have a child in school, we may let them complete the school year, and then they return home. When they are home, they’re able to apply for permanent residency or for citizenship or anything else they’d like to apply for," he said. During a debate last month in Jacksonville, Romney twice talked about self-deportation. "I don't think anyone is interested in going around and rounding up people around the country and deporting 11 million Americans -- or, excuse me 11 million illegal immigrants into America," he said. To strengthen his argument, Gray directed us to Romney’s comments during a January debate in South Carolina. In that debate, Romney said he did not support the DREAM Act, a proposal by two U.S. senators to give qualifying young people here illegally a six-year path to citizenship that must include the completion of a college degree or two years of military service. Romney then went on to talk about the broader topic of illegal immigration: "I think we have to follow the law and insist those who come here illegally ultimately return home, apply and get in line with everyone else." Now, does Romney mean when he said "insist" illegal immigrants return home that he would round them up and deport them? "That’s deportation," Gray said. "What he does instead of saying deport them, he uses weasel words to say one thing to Telemundo and another thing to Fox News." Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which believes fewer immigrants should be allowed in the United States, called it "implausible" to say Romney has flip-flopped. Krikorian calls Romney’s position "attrition through enforcement." "Romney has been pretty clear in describing a self-deportation policy," he told us. "He’s been consistent on that." Krikorian noted that Romney threatened to veto a bill to give in-state tuition to Massachusetts colleges to students who are illegal immigrants. A spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization that wants the federal government to stop illegal immigration and seeks stronger border patrols, said he hasn’t heard Romney talk about deportation. "Nobody who has seriously looked at the issue has said the answer is round everybody up and deport them," said the spokesman, Ira Mehlman. Mehlman said it is implausible to conduct mass deportations. He characterized Romney’s position on illegal immigration as being in the mainstream of thought on the issue. Our conclusion: PolitiFact Georgia found articles dating to 2006 in which Romney was quoted as saying he didn’t believe "in rounding up 11 million people and forcing them at gunpoint from our country." In 2007, Romney told The Boston Globe it was not "practical" to deport every illegal immigrant. He has consistently talked about an immigration approach of supporting policies that encourage illegal immigrants to return to their homeland. We don’t see any recent change in his position and rate this one as a No Flip.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-07T06:00:00	2012-01-27	['None']

pomt-14524	"We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!"	true	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/17/tim-mcginty/cuyahoga-prosecutor-touts-reduction-rape-kits-reel/	Ohio’s March 15 primary will essentially decide the Cuyahoga county prosecutor's race. No Republican candidate is running. Incumbent Tim McGinty and his challenger, Michael C. O’Malley, are both Democrats. McGinty’s website, McGintyForProsecutor.com, is peppered with exclamation points touting his successes since coming into office in 2012. We decided to check out some of the claims McGinty makes about his last four years. "I formed one of the nation's most successful Rape Kit Task Force to eliminate the backlog of 4,850 rape kits that were untested for decades," McGinty says. "Our Rape Kit Task Force will solve and prosecute 1,000 forgotten rape cases. Hundreds of serial rapists will finally be indicted. We are almost halfway to our goal of 1,000 rapes prosecuted!" In 2009, Cleveland police began sending forensic evidence to the Ohio Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in response to news reports that sounded the alarm about thousands of sexual assault kits that never underwent DNA testing. When those DNA profiles match known offenders from a national database, prosecutors can file charges. But what does McGinty mean by "almost halfway to our goal of 1,000," in terms of rapes prosecuted? We asked the Cuyahoga Prosecutor’s Office for the numbers, and here’s what they turned up, as of Feb. 9, 2016: 1,424 completed investigations 2,193 active investigations 444 indicted defendants 136 convictions (out of 149 completed cases) 91.3 percent conviction rate If the goal was to have "1,000 rapes prosecuted," 444 comes pretty close to "almost halfway." But is "indicted" the same as "prosecuted?" Yes, says Jonathan Witmer-Rich, an associate law professor at Cleveland State University. "A prosecution begins when charges are filed, usually by the prosecutor," Witmer-Rich told PolitiFact Ohio. "That is the beginning of the case. So it would be correct to say that McGinty ‘is prosecuting’ a particular defendant even though they have not gone to trial yet or been convicted. Once charges are filed, the defendant is being prosecuted." But can McGinty claim responsibility for the initiative to test the county’s rape-kit backlog? Various media sources credit Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine for putting out the call, over four years ago, for police departments to clear their evidence rooms of shelved rape kits and send them to the central state lab for DNA testing. This month, DeWine’s office marked the 10,000th sexual assault kit tested. Jill Del Greco, the public information officer for the Ohio Attorney General, says that McGinty deserves credit. "A lot more goes into it -- when we get a hit, they can’t necessarily go out and make an arrest," Del Greco says. "Once we obtain the DNA testing results, we return the results to the investigating agency." Witnesses have to be tracked down, she continued, and oftentimes, the victim has to be found again, too, when years have passed since the crime occurred. It’s up to the prosecutors and police departments in each jurisdiction to re-boot these investigations. Our rating McGinty said his office is "almost halfway" to his goal of prosecuting 1,000 rapes as a result of testing a cache of thousands of previously untested rape kits. As of Feb. 9, 444 defendants had been indicted, which is nearing the halfway point of 500. A defendant is being prosecuted once charged, so we rate this claim True.

pomt-10468	After Reagan took office, "we didn't raise taxes and we didn't cut entitlements. What we did was we cut taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/18/john-mccain/one-major-tax-cut-then-lots-of-raises/	Throughout the primary season, the Republican contenders — Sen. John McCain among them — jockeyed for position as the heir to the legacy of Ronald Reagan. A key part of that legacy is the conservative mantra — treated practically as sacred truth — that Reagan was a die-hard tax cutter. While campaigning in Westport, Conn., on April 9, 2008, McCain made it clear that he's a true believer in Reagan's tax-cutting record. Asked by a voter how he planned to balance the federal budget, McCain said he would emulate Reagan and pursue a supply-side approach, the belief that cutting taxes can actually grow tax revenue by stimulating the economy. "I don't believe in a static economy," McCain said. "I believe that when there's stimulus for growth, when there's opportunity, when people keep more of their money — and the government is the least efficient way to spend your money — that economies improve." And McCain said he'd pursue a policy just as Reagan had. After Reagan took office, "we didn't raise taxes and we didn't cut entitlements," he said. "What we did was we cut taxes." Whether the comment about Reagan's tax-cutting proclivities, as well as his success at safeguarding entitlements, is true or not depends on how much of the Reagan record you want to consider. In the period immediately after Reagan took office, McCain's statement is on the money. Reagan in 1981 proposed — and Congress passed — a massive tax cut, the centerpiece of which was a 25 percent reduction in marginal tax rates. The result was that taxes paid as a share of gross domestic product immediately began to decline from the post-World War II peak of 20.2 percent that they hit that year. Reagan didn't cut entitlements either — a promise he'd made during his 1980 campaign. But that's not to say he didn't consider it. In 1982, Reagan went along with a plan by GOP Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico to slow the growth of spending on Social Security and cut $40-billion from the program. Reagan also called for a 10 percent reduction in total spending for Medicaid in his budget proposal that year. In the end, both ideas came to naught, in the face of Democratic opposition in Congress. McCain's recollection that Reagan safeguarded entitlement programs becomes more true later in Reagan's presidency, while his memory of Reagan as a tax cutter becomes more flawed. In 1983, Reagan signed legislation aimed at preserving Social Security's solvency by raising payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits of upper-income Americans. The plan certainly preserved Social Security but also demonstrated that Reagan was willing to impose tax increases, even if he didn't propose them and rarely accepted them with enthusiasm. As former Reagan adviser Bruce Bartlett wrote in a 2003 article for National Review, Reagan signed two major tax increases in 1982 that took back much of the break he'd provided in his 1981 tax bill. After the Social Security tax increase of 1983, Reagan approved further tax increases — in one form or another — in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. None of them was particularly draconian and taxes as a share of GDP continued to decline until 1984, when they bottomed out at 18.4 percent but then rose back to 19.2 percent by 1989, when Reagan left office. The overall percentage then was still lower than during Reagan's first year in the White House. Still, the fact that Reagan signed legislation raising taxes at all during his presidency certainly runs counter to the current GOP orthodoxy and would seem to contradict, if not disprove, McCain's statement, which we find to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13101	Says Richard Burr "was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/05/deborah-ross/deborah-ross-says-richard-burr-voted-against-ban-i/	Deborah Ross, the Democratic challenger for Republican Sen. Richard Burr’s seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider. This summer she claimed that Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks." We rated that Half True. More recently, she has been claiming Burr voted against a bill that would’ve banned members of Congress from insider trading. "It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress," Ross said in their recent debate. "And he called that vote brave." Burr doesn’t deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said it’s being blown way out of proportion. He defended his actions in 2012 after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross. We wondered what the real story was. Insider trading Insider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal. In April 2012, the STOCK Act – which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge – specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs. President Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts. Burr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress. "It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading," Burr said in response to Ross’ barb at their debate. "That’s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that’s in fact what the STOCK Act did." Burr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim. Legal confusion There is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it’s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide. While Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn’t do. If you’re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions, read this 2011 paper. Or, here’s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law. Former SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers "benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn’t benefit from. They’re immune from insider trading laws." However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami said in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were "exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions." So the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes. Congressional suspicions Regardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions. One 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average. "Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information," Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011. Zingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, "despite the potential cost to their reputations." In 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated allegations of insider trading by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses’ policy decisions. One aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report – which her boss was involved in – found in the bank’s favor and sent stock prices surging. Other parts of the STOCK Act Yet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time – and it appears no one knows the real answer to that – he’s still not correct that the law was purely duplicative. The STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements – although Congress quietly rolled back the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill. But is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the transcript of his remarks on Burr’s own website. "It's ludicrous," Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. "That's why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn't be doing this." Burr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only ‘no’ votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3. Our ruling Ross said Burr "was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave." She’s right about Burr’s vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. What’s less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07617	The GOP budget plan "would cut nearly a million jobs."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/21/organizing-america/organizing-america-says-gop-budget-would-cut-1-mil/	Organizing for America has hit the web this week to marshal opposition to $61 billion in budget cuts proposed by House Republicans. OFA is a Democratic organization that arose from President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign operation. Its Virginia arm claimed in Twitter messages and a Facebook posting in mid-March that the GOP budget plan "would cut nearly a million jobs." Since the U.S. has added about 1.3 million total jobs in the past 12 months, any plan that could take away 1 million sounds like serious business. We set out to see if OFA and the Democrats have their facts right. Democrats have been brandishing two big numbers during the debates. One is a claim that 700,000 jobs would be lost if the GOP budget is enacted. The second, as mentioned above, is that almost one million jobs are at stake. Alec Gerlach, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, told us these different numbers are based on separate economic estimates. The 700,000 figure comes from a report by Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Zandi said the spending cuts would reduce the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and cause a loss of 700,000 existing and anticipated jobs by the end of 2012. Zandi’s computations are complicated. They do not mean that 700,000 people would lose jobs. They include a loss of hypothetical jobs Zandi believes would be created if government spending is not cut. The estimate of "nearly a million jobs being lost" first appeared in a Feb. 15 column by Dana Milbank, a left-leaning columnist at The Washington Post. Milbank spoke with Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Lilly estimated the GOP plan would eradicate 650,000 jobs, both at government agencies and at companies working for the government. With those unemployed workers suddenly spending less money, he told us another 325,000 jobs -- or one for every two laid-off workers -- could be lost. "If you are cutting highway spending or clean water work, the impact can occur over three to four years," Lilly told us. "If you cut federal employees and reduce the number of people at the Social Security Administration this year, you know the exact timing of the impact." These estimates, as well as a report by Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips warning that a $60 billion cut could cost the economy 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent of its GDP growth in the middle part of this year, have drawn fire from some economists. John Taylor, a conservative economist at Stanford University, believes the economy would grow faster if Congress pushes through spending cuts and shows it has a "credible’ debt reduction plan. He said the cuts would make businesses less worried about future tax increases, meaning they would be more likely to start hiring additional employees. His reasoning has been embraced by many Republicans, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, R-7th. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Senate committee March 1 that while GOP spending cuts would "have a negative impact" on the economy, he said the job losses "would be certainly much less than 700,000." The Fed chairman also disputed the idea that the cuts could lower GDP growth by 2 percent. Federal spending cuts are a rarity in the United States, occurring just a few times since World War II. The major reductions came at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Private sector jobs increased after both of those wars, but the gains were driven by many factors, including the return to a peace-time economy and the demobilization of millions of soldiers, many of whom went directly into the private work force. During larges stretches of the 1980s and 1990s government spending grew at a slower rate than the overall economy,and large job growth occurred. But economists told us there is a not a direct link between spending policies and job policies. Let’s review. Organizing for America’s Virginia chapter said the GOP spending plan could "cut nearly a million jobs," basing these estimates on a report from Scott Lilly, a budget expert at the liberal Center for American Progress. Other economists, including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, believe the impact of the spending cuts would be much smaller. And Republicans have brought forward a number of economists who say spending reductions would increase employment. Democrats -- and the economists they cite -- may be right when they say the GOP’s proposed cuts would cost large numbers of jobs. But they are basing their reports on economic projections, not guarantees. Just as we said when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor declared lower spending would create more private sector jobs, no one knows for sure. Therefore we rate OFA’s job cut claims Half True.

pomt-00997	The governor’s budget proposal reduces the state austerity cut to education to under $500 million for 2016.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/06/alan-essig/essig-accurate-education-austerity-cuts-under-500-/	Georgia’s public schools haven’t been fully funded under the state’s education funding formula since 2002. That’s expected to still be the case in the fiscal year that starts July 1, although the financial picture for schools is looking up. Last year, with the governor and all 236 members of the General Assembly facing re-election, the so-called state austerity cut to K-12 education was reduced by about $314 million. Now Gov. Nathan Deal wants to go further. His nearly $21.8 billion budget proposal for the fiscal year that starts July 1 would commit an additional $280 million to K-12 education and says local school systems would have flexibility to spend the money to reduce or eliminate furlough days, increase instructional days or raise salaries. If lawmakers support the governor’s plan, the austerity cut to schools would fall below $500 million for Fiscal Year 2016, Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute said in a recent blog post. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the math, given what’s at stake for the state’s 180 local school systems and the 1 million-plus students who attend Georgia public schools.. Beginning in 2003, local school system budgets have been squeezed by state austerity cuts cumulatively totalling more than $8 billion, including back-to-back annual cuts of $1 billion-plus from 2010 to 2014. Many school systems have raised class sizes, abandoned the traditional 180-day school calendar, dropped electives and furloughed staff, all while increasing local property taxes and dipping into their rainy day savings. Statewide, systems eliminated more than 8,000 teaching jobs. Before we dive into the numbers, here’s a brief explanation of an austerity cut. It is the gap between the amount of money that school districts need to provide a quality education to all students as determined by the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula and the amount of money the General Assembly and governor approve. According to the Georgia Department of Education, that gap or austerity cut was (with rounding): $135 million in 2003; $283 million in 2004; $333 million in 2005; $333 million in 2006; $170 million in 2007; $143 million in 2008; $496 million in 2009; $1.4 billion in 2010; $1.1 billion in 2011; $1.1 billion in 2012; $1.1 billion in 2013; $1.1 billion in 2014. As we said earlier, last year, school systems saw some relief when the governor recommended, and lawmakers approved, adding $314 million to the education budget for Fiscal year 2015. That reduced the austerity cut for the current year to about $747 million. Many school systems used the extra money to restore some sense of normalcy -- dozens reverted back to the traditional 180-day school calendar. More than 60, though, continued staff furloughs, according to a GBPI survey last fall. In Pike County, near Macon, Superintendent Michael Duncan said the extra state money this year allowed his system to eliminate furloughs and add back staff needed to launch the new state teacher evaluation system. The system still has "critical needs in professional development and instructional support materials," Duncan said. But, he said, "the future certainly looks brighter under Gov. Deal’s proposed budget." That budget earmarks an extra $280 million to education, which will reduce the austerity cut from about $746 million to about $466 million -- or below $500 million as Essig said in his blog. The exact amount, likely between $460 million and $470 million, is determined by the state Department of Education each year, Essig told PolitiFact. Claire Suggs, an education policy analyst on Essig’s staff, said school systems are likely to put any additional money they receive next year to continuing to restore programs that they cut or could not address through the very lean times. "They are very concerned about teacher salaries and class size," Suggs said. "Only a small number have been able to increase salaries, and district leaders are very sensitive about that." Class size, she said, is also a "huge issue," but tricky since reducing it means hiring more teachers and finding the money for salaries and benefits. "It really will come down to what’s most pressing to them." Our conclusion: Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, is correct in his calculation that, if the governor’s budget proposal is approved, the austerity cut to K-12 education for Fiscal 2016 would fall below $500 million. That’s a huge amount, but well below $1 billion, which was the cut each year from 2010 to 2014. We rate Essig’s statement as True.

pomt-00865	"Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor .... In addition, a majority of them are students of color."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/15/erika-sanzi/writer-says-most-children-ri-charter-school-lotter/	The expansion of charter schools has been the subject of contentious debate in Rhode Island in recent years. So much so that state lawmakers are fielding a raft of bills this session aiming to limit charter school growth or change their funding method. Cumberland mother and former educator Erika Sanzi weighed in with a March 5, 2015, commentary in The Providence Journal supporting school choice and charter schools. The piece was entitled "Taking aim at R.I.'s poor, minority students." In it, Sanzi faulted the Cumberland School Committee for passing a resolution asking the General Assembly to halt charter school expansion until a new funding mechanism is created. Such a move, would disproportionately impact poor, minority families, she said. She stated, "Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor (indicating that their family’s income qualifies them for free or reduced-priced lunch). In addition, a majority of them are students of color." We reached out to Sanzi to learn what sources she used to support her statement. We also contacted the Rhode Island League of Charter Schools, which advocates for and supports 18 of the state’s 25 charter schools. We quickly learned that there is no firm data on the race, ethnicity or income levels of the large pool of children who are in the lotteries for charter school slots -- the group Sanzi was talking about. However, there is ample data on the children who actually enroll in the schools. As we’ll see, that helped us evaluate Sanzi’s claim. Stephen A. Nardelli, executive director of the league, told us that the charter school lottery application does not request or require information about a prospective student’s ethnicity or socio-economic status. The league does not track such information, but he said that 11,889 students had applied in 2014 for 1,252 openings and that about 7,000 are enrolled overall. We also reached out to the state Department of Education. The state doesn’t track the ethnicity or economic status of charter school applicants either, Elliot Krieger, a spokesman for the department, said. But the state does calculate the ethnicity and economic status of students enrolled in charter schools. An April 2014 education department report showed that in October 2013, 52 percent of the students were Hispanic; 16 percent were black; and 6 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, while 26 percent were white. Across Rhode Island, Hispanics comprised 23 percent of the state’s total public school student population, 8 percent were black, 62 percent white and 7 percent were another ethnicity or multi-ethnic, according to the report. That same report showed that 67 percent of the charter school students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches, a key indicator of poverty. That compared with 47 percent of public school students overall. Both sets of figures were close to those in Sanzi’s claim. When Sanzi got back to us, she acknowledged that the state doesn’t track the makeup of those applying to charter schools, but she produced two reports based on more current Department of Education numbers. Her calculations, which used data on school enrollments over the course of the entire 2013-2014 school year, placed the percentage of charter school students that qualified for free and reduced-price lunches at 72 percent. Her calculations on the ethnic makeup of charter schools were based on October 2014 data. They showed that the ethnic composition of the charter school population had remained basically steady from 2013 to 2014, with Hispanics comprising 54 percent of the student body; blacks 16 percent; whites 25 percent; and other ethnicities 6 percent. She also cited a lottery report from Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy, the only school to collect information on its applicants. The school found that 69 percent of the applicants qualified for free and reduced-price lunches in 2013-2014 and that the percentage climbed to 72 percent the next school year. Sanzi noted that, according to the state, 78 percent of the charter school students come from just four communities: Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence and Woonsocket. She then looked to the 2014 Rhode Island Kids Count Factbook. That study found high percentages of low income students in each of those four cities: Central Falls (81 percent); Pawtucket (78 percent); Providence (80 percent); and Woonsocket (75 percent). She also cited a report out of the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University that shows that three out of four students in those communities are Latino. Our ruling Erika Sanzi said that "Of the 10,000 Rhode Island children in charter school lotteries for the fall, more than 70 percent are poor (indicating that their family’s income qualifies them for free or reduced-priced lunch). In addition, a majority of them are students of color." As we’ve shown, there’s no way for Sanzi -- or anyone else -- to know the precise demographic makeup of the children in Rhode Island’s charter school lotteries. But state records show that about three-quarters of the students who actually are enrolled in charter schools are students of color, and that 78 percent are drawn from just four communities, each with a high percentage of poor and Hispanic children. Those numbers and the other evidence we found suggest that Sanzi’s statement is not only accurate, but perhaps understated. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Erika Sanzi	None	None	None	2015-03-15T00:01:00	2015-03-05	['Rhode_Island']

pomt-00201	Says Claire McCaskill "even said this about private planes, ‘that normal people can afford it.’"	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/17/senate-leadership-fund/did-claire-mccaskill-say-normal-people-can/	Correction, Oct. 17, 2018: Initially, we published this fact-check with a rating of False, because based on the video available, it did not appear that McCaskill was talking about private planes. After publication, we received more complete video of the question-and-answer session between McCaskill and a constituent that showed she was in fact responding to a question about private planes, as well as a report describing the meeting. We re-assessed the evidence, archived the original version here, and published the version you see here with a new rating of Half True. We apologize for the error. Private planes have been a long-running headache for Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. In 2011, she sold a family owned private plane and repaid the federal government $88,000 for flights she paid for through her Senate office. Earlier this year, while running for a third term in a nip-and-tuck race, McCaskill took heat for using her current private plane to criss-cross portions of the state while she was supposedly on a three-day RV tour of the state. The Senate Leadership Fund — a pro-Republican super PAC with close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — is seeking to remind voters about this history in an ad released Oct. 16. The ad takes aim at McCaskill’s "high-flying lifestyle." An animated plane labeled "Air Claire" leads the viewer through the ad, and the narrator cites investments by her husband in the Cayman Islands and reminds viewers of the money McCaskill repaid to the treasury for flights. At one point, the narrator says, "Claire even said this about private planes." The ad then shows footage of McCaskill saying, "That normal people can afford it." The narrator returns to ask, "Normal people can afford a private plane?" The ad concludes with the narrator saying, "Multimillionaire Claire McCaskill: Way out of touch with Missouri." Did McCaskill really say that "normal people can afford" private planes? She did, but the ad takes her literal words out of context. The remark occurred at an Aug. 19, 2017, town hall in Kennett, Mo., located in the state’s southeastern "bootheel." McCaskill was taking a question from Sam Jewell, the manager of Kennett Memorial Airport, who asked whether the federal air traffic system should be privatized. McCaskill responded that her answer was not at the moment, but she added that she hoped the privatization push would nudge the Federal Aviation Administration into long-needed upgrades of its radar system. (We’ve summarized her answer in this article, but you can read the full transcript here.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Jewell responded, "Well, when you go to any other country, you know the cost of flying — I just had a friend who went home to Greece and was trying to fly around over there, it costs like $500 just to go from one little city to the next, and you have to have credit cards on file for them to charge your account. You know, that’s one thing the United States has that nobody else has, is the freedom to fly around and be affordable where a normal person can afford it." McCaskill then responded, "Will you remind them when they come after me about my husband’s plane? That normal people can afford it?" The crowd laughed. "Yeah, but I understand the fear, and I understand the uncertainty, but I remain committed to trying to look at any solution we can find to get our stuff updated, but not at the expense of general aviation." By showing her words in isolation, the Senate Leadership Fund exaggerates McCaskill’s remark. McCaskill was wrapping up a wonky discussion of federal aviation privatization with a constituent whose business depended heavily on the resolution of that issue. She was directly responding to Jewell’s remarks about a friend’s comparative experiences flying a private plane in the United States and Greece. She repeated Jewell’s words when she used the phrase "normal people." In context, these seem to refer to "normal" users of private planes, not to "normal" Americans more generally. In addition to snipping out Jewell’s lead-in comment, the ad also cut what followed McCaskill’s retort: laughter from the crowd. The McCaskill campaign said she was attempting to make a joke that elaborated on what the audience member said, and it appears at least some people listening took it that way. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund says McCaskill "even said this about private planes, ‘that normal people can afford it.’" She said those words, but the footage in the ad leaves out both the lead-in comment that prompted McCaskill’s remark and the laughter that followed it. The full footage makes it clear that McCaskill was wrapping up a policy-heavy debate with a private-aviation manager and with a riff using the airport manager’s words. In context, he was referring to "normal" users of private planes, as opposed to "normal" Americans more generally. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10200	"Obama has asked for $932-million in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he’s been in Congress."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/16/john-mccain/mccains-got-obama-over-a-pork-barrel/	John McCain has tried to bolster his reformist credentials throughout the campaign by reminding voters that he has long been a crusader against pork barrel spending – federal money for parochial projects in particular states. At the same time, he's derided Democratic nominee Barack Obama for taking no similar stand. McCain contends that pork spending, which is typically earmarked quietly into massive federal spending bills, forces costs onto every taxpayer that should be borne only by the people who benefit from the projects. The latest broadside by McCain against Obama came in a speech at a rally in Tampa, Fla., on Sept. 16, 2008. “I have never asked for a single earmark, pork barrel project for my state of Arizona. Sen. Obama has asked for $932-million dollars in earmarks, literally $1-million for every day that he’s been in Congress.” We've examined the first part of that sentence, about McCain's own record on pork requests, here. In this item, we'll focus on what he says about Obama, which is nearly identical to what McCain said in a mailer to Florida voters that has been circulating for more than a week. The mailer says, "Obama has requested $1-million in pork barrel spending for every working day he has been in the Senate." Obama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he's requested – but not necessarily received – during that time. It totals $931.3-million, even though the Illinois senator earlier this year said he would eschew any pork for fiscal 2009. The key phrase in McCain's mailer, "for every working day" is missing from the remarks McCain made in his Tampa speech. Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain is on solid ground in the mailer. Technically, Obama's been "in Congress" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying "every working day"? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-16T00:00:00	2008-09-16	['Barack_Obama', 'United_States_Congress']

pomt-15113	As many as six federal department budget bills have been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/sep/11/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-opposition-confederate-flag-lim/	A congressman told a Texas group that action on measures funding the government slowed this summer due to opposition to proposals banning Confederate flag sales. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat whose district runs south from Austin into San Antonio, stressed at a Sept. 3, 2015, Greater San Antonio Chamber of Commerce gathering that he hoped to help resurrect the U.S. Export-Import Bank. As it was in the Republican-majority House, Doggett said, up to six federal department budget bills had been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops. Is that so? We should note that what Doggett said on this topic wasn’t directly quoted in the San Antonio Express-News news story where we saw his claim. Doggett’s backup To our inquiry, including a request for his prepared text, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale said by email she didn’t have Doggett’s precise words. Still, Tisdale said, "Republicans fearful of a floor vote about the Confederate flag, pulled one appropriations bill from floor consideration and have declined to present any more." She said Doggett "did refer to any display of the ‘Stars and Bars’ at a federal facility of which one example is gift shops." Tisdale followed up with an email including a document grouping July 2015 news stories recapping House Democrats’ efforts to amend a 2016 spending bill to bar the display of a Confederate flag and to keep the National Park Service from working with vendors that sell such flags. She also excerpted floor remarks by Democrats including a July 9, 2015, statement by Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip: "Three Democratic amendments were adopted earlier in the consideration of the Interior" Department appropriations "bill that would end the practice of displaying or selling Confederate battle flags and flag merchandise in national parks and National Park Service cemeteries. Those amendments were adopted by voice vote." After that, Democrats complained, Republicans moved to take the amendments off. South Carolina and House action News stories and congressional transcripts confirm the flag amendments making it into the Interior spending measure for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2015, and also a Republican move to reverse course culminating in House consideration of the legislation stalling out. Mid-summer news stories, including several in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, described the flag impasse bubbling up just as South Carolina lawmakers agreed to take down the Confederate battle flag long displayed outside its Capitol. That takedown unspooled after a white man the month before opened fire in a historically black Charleston church, killing nine people. A July 10, 2015, story in The Hill said: "House Republicans are hitting the brakes on consideration of spending bills after leaders yanked a measure from the floor this week over the display of the Confederate flag. The House was originally slated to consider the 2016 spending bill for Financial Services next week," the story said, "but the odds are now low for it hitting the floor. Republicans are worried that Democrats could try to offer more amendments related to the display of the Confederate flag that could again tie the GOP into knots." The story said Republican House leaders earlier "yanked the annual spending bill for the Interior Department on Thursday," July 8, 2015, "after an amendment from Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) that would ban the display of the Confederate flag in national cemeteries passed by voice vote earlier in the week." Three flag amendments We pulled up each of the flag amendments that made it into the spending act. Huffman’s amendment, per the Congressional Record for July 7, 2015, forbade the park service from allowing "a grave in any federal cemetery to be decorated with a Confederate flag." Earlier that day, Huffman won adoption of an amendment barring funds from being spent with any entity "that provides for the sale in any facility within a unit of the National Park System of an item with a Confederate flag as a stand-alone feature." Huffman told House members the mandate was needed to follow up on a park service request that gift shops, bookstores and other concessionaires voluntarily end the sale of standalone items--such as flags, pins, and belt buckles--with imagery of the Confederate flag. Also, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., won approval of an amendment barring the park service from spending funds to display a Confederate flag except when the flags "provide historical context." Jeffries told colleagues: "We have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to go in our march toward a more perfect Union. The cancer of racial hatred continues to adversely impact our society, and people of good will must unite to eradicate it. Limiting the use of federal funds connected to the purchase or display of the Confederate flag is an important step in that direction." The Republican move to repeal The Hill subsequently reported: "Some Republicans, primarily representing Southern states, found out about the" cemetery "amendment after the fact and threatened to vote against the entire bill if it remained intact," the story said. And after it proved uncertain that Republicans could win enough votes to undo Huffman’s amendment. House GOP leaders pulled the Interior bill from the floor." The Congressional Record for July 8, 2015, shows that Calvert offered an amendment peeling back the just-added prohibition on the park service displaying Confederate flags or decorating graves with them. In debate, Calvert said his move would codify existing park service policy "with regard to the declaration of cemeteries and concession sales." Objecting, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., said: "While in certain and very limited circumstances, it might be appropriate in a national park to display the image of the Confederate flag in a historical context--and I say that as a social studies teacher--the general display or sale of Confederate flag items is inappropriate and divisive." She added that "we should make sure that we uphold what this House stood for yesterday, which is to say no to racism, which is to say no to hate speech." Next, a voice vote was declared as carrying Calvert’s amendment to passage. McCollum reacted by calling for a record vote, which would show how each member stood on Calvert’s amendment. The House’s acting chair answered by saying further proceedings on the amendment "will be postponed;" the full measure also wasn’t further considered. Post-debate comments A July 9, 2015, news story in The Hill quoted House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ill., telling reporters the Interior Department proposal had been pulled to avoid the flag issue from becoming a political football. "That bill is going to sit in abeyance until we come to some resolution," Boehner said. The story said the action affecting the Interior proposal was the second time in the year that House Republicans had "punted" on the display of the Confederate flag. In early July 2015, the House voted to refer a measure to ban the display of the Confederate flag around the Capitol complex to committee for review, instead of immediately passing or rejecting it, the story said. A July 10, 2015, Associated Press news story quoted unidentified House Republican aides saying a bill covering general government operations tentatively set for consideration the next week wouldn’t be considered after all. The story quoted Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., chairman of the pivotal House Appropriations Committee, saying "there's a number of options that are being considered" for moving forward on the 2016 spending measures. By our count, that’s three appropriations proposals reportedly stalled in connection with anti-Confederate-flag proposals. Tisdale also pointed out a July 14, 2015, news blog post by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, stating Boehner that day had "reportedly told Republicans during their weekly closed-door meeting there was a hold on all spending bills until they could figure something out on the Confederate flag." The account quoted Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, saying: "We know that every approps bill that we put forward they’re going to go back to trying to make some, you know — exploit for political reasons what happened in South Carolina. And so the speaker wants to work something out with Democrats so they’ll stop doing that so we can move forward," Fleming said. A July 21, 2015, New York Times news story said that weeks after House Republicans called for a bipartisan solution to the fight over the Confederate flag on federal property, there was no visible progress — and, the story said, "the issue has unexpectedly paralyzed spending bills on the House floor." The Times summarized what happened after the House accepted Huffman’s cemetery amendment: "Rep. Ken Calvert, Republican of California, offered an amendment to permit displays of the flag in federal cemeteries on one day a year, Confederate Memorial Day, which is celebrated in nine states. Realizing they did not have the votes for that amendment — but also did not have the votes for their spending bill without it — Republicans pulled the underlying bill from the floor, effectively shutting down the House appropriations process." The story said Boehner’s idea to focus on the flag issue through a bipartisan working group seemed to have gone nowhere. It quoted Boehner saying: "I actually think it’s time for some adults here in the Congress to actually sit down and have a conversation about how to address this issue." Democrats more or less rejected the suggestion, saying that there was little to discuss and that the flags should simply be removed, the newspaper said. We reached out to Boehner’s office and the Republican side of the House appropriations panel. A Boehner spokesman didn’t reply. We didn’t field an on-the-record reply from a committee spokesperson. House yet to vote on six spending acts A July 14, 2015, press release led us to conclude that up to six annual spending bills were at least temporarily marooned. In the release, Chairman Rogers said the appropriations panel had completed its work that day by clearing its 12th and final government funding measure, "marking the first time since 2009 that all Appropriations bills have been approved by the full committee." Rogers said "In addition," Rogers said then, "six Appropriations bills have been approved by the full House." His implication: Six hadn’t been voted to the Senate. That was still so as of the second week of September 2015, a House website indicates, with the House yet to vote on fiscal 2016 spending proposals for agriculture; financial services; homeland security; the Department of Interior and the environment; labor, health and human services and education; and the State Department and foreign operations. In contrast, the House had sent the Senate appropriations proposals for commerce/justice/science; defense; energy and water; the legislative branch; military/veterans; and transportation/Housing and Urban Development. Other factors slowing action? Next, we looked into other possible factors for the stalled budget bills. There may be a few. The July 10 news story in The Hill hinted at factors, stating that whether the House advanced spending measures or not, the GOP-authored bills remained "very unlikely to become law. Senate Democrats have promised to block all GOP funding measures until a new budget deal is reached to lift sequestration spending levels," the story said, closing: "Congress may have to turn to a short-term spending bill when it returns from recess in September to avoid a government shutdown at the end" of that month. Similarly, Donald Wolfensberger, long-time director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, replied to our query about Doggett’s statement by suggesting it’s not unusual for the House to slow action on spending measures that it knows won’t sail through the Senate. In past years, he said by email, it seemed fruitless for the House to advance more spending bills when senators had vowed not to take them up--as, he said, Senate Democrats have done this year until a more generous budget accord is reached. Moreover, Wolfensberger said, "I cannot attest to the rumor that the threat of Confederate flag amendments would even be germane to all of the remaining bills." Via the the Nexis database, we came across an Aug. 27, 2015, post on the Fox News "Capitol Attitude" blog suggesting multiple reasons the spending measures might stay bogged down. Congress must resolve whether to avoid a partial government shutdown by the start of the 2016 fiscal year Oct. 1, 2015, the post said, but the House and Senate to date had "sent precisely zero of the 12 annual spending bills which fund the federal government to" President Barack "Obama to either sign or veto. If any of those 12 bills aren't signed by the president by Oct. 1, that portion of the government shuts down." Trip wires that could touch off a partial shutdown, the post said, range from conservative pushes to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood or to reverse Obama’s initiatives on immigration, environmental policy or the Obamacare law. "Don't forget," the post went on, "liberals in the House brought the appropriations process to a standstill in July over the placement of Confederate flags at national cemeteries." Our ruling Doggett said in San Antonio that House votes on up to six federal department budget bills had been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops. When he spoke, the House had yet to vote on six 2016 spending measures. During floor debate, a stand-off about Democratic amendments restricting displays and sales of the Confederate flag--including a proposal barring the park service from enlisting concessionaires selling the flags--evidently derailed the Interior appropriations act with expected House action on two other spending acts reportedly put off. Still, other factors—such as general reluctance among House leaders to send spending proposals to the potentially unfriendly Senate—may figure into the body’s inaction on the six measures.

See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Giuliani made the same point a day before, telling CNN, "I don't even know if that's a crime, colluding about Russians." This isn’t the first time Trump has dismissed collusion on legal grounds. In a December interview with the New York Times, he noted the views of Harvard emeritus law professor Alan Dershowitz. "I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day," Trump said. "He said, No. 1, there is no collusion, No. 2, collusion is not a crime." For this fact-check, we’ll sort out how collusion overlaps with the law. Key takeaways The press uses the term collusion to describe a range of activities that might have taken place involving the Trump campaign and Russian representatives. Collusion is part of antitrust law (but those statutes are irrelevant in this situation). While the special counsel investigation has produced indictments and guilty pleas, it’s too early to say whether the Trump campaign broke any laws. Legal opinions vary, but people who know the law say that certain statutes could have been violated. The common use of the word collusion includes potentially illegal behavior. An imprecise term If Trump were talking about the purely legal use of the word collusion, he would be wrong. Collusion falls under federal antitrust law, and it involves competing companies that cut secret deals to boost each other’s profits. Trump isn’t using the word that way, and nor is anyone else. The issue is whether people in the Trump campaign knowingly boosted Russian efforts to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to the benefit of candidate Trump. Russia’s intentions are not disputed, at least not among U.S. intelligence agencies and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The focus is on what the Trump campaign did and whether that was illegal, regardless whether the relevant statute contains the word "collusion." No crime here Harvard legal scholar Dershowitz found it hard to see what law the Trump campaign might have broken, even if it knew in advance about emails that Russian operatives allegedly stole from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta. "Obviously, if anyone conspired in advance with another to commit a crime, such as hacking the Democratic National Committee, that would be criminal," Dershowitz wrote in 2017. "But merely seeking to obtain the work product of a prior hack would be no more criminal than a newspaper publishing the work products of thefts such as the Pentagon Papers and the material stolen by Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning." Defense attorney William Jeffress told Politico that "collusion with the Russians in attempting to affect the outcome of the presidential election is a serious political scandal, but I must say it is not clear that it provides a basis for criminal prosecution." But other legal experts say that the Trump campaign could have run afoul of various laws. Potential legal pitfalls If Russia deployed its people, as Mueller described in his indictment of a dozen Russians, then it spent money and that could be a legal hazard for the Trump campaign. Nathaniel Persily at Stanford University Law School said one relevant statute is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime," Persily told us in 2017. "And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime." Persily pointed to a 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on the 2002 law. The judges said that the law bans foreign nationals "from making expenditures to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate." Another election law specialist, John Coates at Harvard University Law School, said if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure. "The related funds could also be viewed as an illegal contribution to any candidate who coordinates (colludes) with the foreign speaker," Coates said. University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said that in addition to possible violations of campaign finance laws, the Trump campaign could be open to another charge. "If others participated in the scheme to do this, it could be a conspiracy," Hasen said. "Whether you want to call that ‘collusion’ or not seems besides the point." The Lawfare Blog, a project with ties to the Brookings Institution, explored whether the Trump campaign was as safe as Dershowitz said when it came to the stolen emails. There is room in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for people to be punished for helping distribute hacked materials. The hacking itself might be only a misdemeanor, but publishing the emails could turn into a felony under state and federal laws. If people in the Trump campaign knew that a release was in the cards, they could be accused of aiding and abetting that transgression. "A defendant wouldn’t have to have been involved from the outset, but he or she would have needed to be aware of the larger scheme before deciding to participate in the second element—the part that made it a felony—for accomplice liability to attach," the Lawfare authors wrote. Josh Douglas at the University of Kentucky Law School offered two other possible relevant statutes. "Collusion in a federal election with a foreign entity could potentially fall under other crimes, such as against public corruption," Douglas said. "There's also a general anti-coercion federal election law." And as always in an investigation, if people lie to federal agents or otherwise try to cover their tracks, that is a felony as well. However, that could be seen as a separate act from any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. Our ruling Trump said that collusion is not a crime. If he means that in a strictly legal sense, he is wrong because collusion is part of antitrust legislation. If he means it in the only way that fits with Russian interference in the 2016 election, then a broader definition applies. Some legal experts don’t see how coordinating with the Russians violates the criminal code. But others can name specific statutes that could be triggered. Those laws don’t include the word "collusion," but they do cover the sort of actions under investigation by the special counsel. Activities by the Trump campaign might have broken laws that deal with elections, public corruption or computer fraud. We don’t say that anyone in the Trump campaign violated these laws. The point is that coordination with Russian representatives potentially could violate them. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00089	"Tina (Smith) profited from the opioid crisis." ​	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/31/karin-housley/karin-housley-twists-tina-smiths-finances-allege-p/	In a recent Minnesota Republican ad for U.S. Senate, a man and woman clink flutes of champagne on the beach as text rolls across the screen: "Tina Smith loves the good life." Smith is defending her U.S. Senate seat on Nov. 6. She was appointed to the position earlier this year after fellow Democrat Al Franken stepped down following sexual misconduct allegations. The "good life" ad comes from Smith’s Republican challenger, state Sen. Karin Housley, and the text on screen quickly departs from the beach scene’s serenity. The next line: "Tina profited from the opioid crisis." The ad lists other dubious ways Smith supposedly enjoys herself, but this one caught our attention. We decided to see if the claim that Smith benefited financially from the opioid crisis held any water. As evidence of Smith profiting from the opioid crisis, Housley’s campaign sent us financial disclosure forms, pointing to Smith and her husband’s jointly owned stock in Abbott Laboratories of a value between $250,000 and $500,000. The Smiths invested in St. Jude Medical, a medical device company, which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in 2017. After the acquisition, St. Jude Medical stock was changed to Abbott stock. In 1996, Abbott partnered in aggressive OxyContin marketing with Purdue Pharma — the company responsible for introducing OxyContin as a supposedly safe opioid pill. In OxyContin’s first year on the market, Abbott made $49 million. That annual figure had jumped to $1.6 billion by 2002. But Abbott cut off its opioid connections in 2002, nearly 15 years before it acquired the company in which the Smiths held stock. The Housley campaign also pointed out that Archie Smith, Tina’s husband, held between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, which has been sued for its role in the opioid crisis. Johnson & Johnson is a also a parent company of two companies that have also been sued for marketing opioids. In Smith’s most recent financial report, the income from that stock was between $200 and $1,000. Our ruling Housley claimed Smith profited from the opioid crisis. The idea that the Smiths benefited financially from Abbott Laboratories’ actions a full 14 years before the company acquired St. Jude Medical goes too far. Smith’s husband does hold between $1,000 and $15,000 in stock in Johnson & Johnson, but it's hard to draw a straight line from that amount of stock ownership to "profiting off the opioid crisis." Overall, the statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Karin Housley	None	None	None	2018-10-31T11:55:08	2018-10-18	['None']
pomt-06026	Suzanne Bonamici was the only no vote on a 2009 bill cracking down on drunk drivers.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/rob-cornilles/was-suzanne-bonamici-sole-no-vote-senate-drunk-dri/	This week’s televised debate between Republican Rob Cornilles and Democrat Suzanne Bonamici offered a rare chance to watch the two question each other. Cornilles tried to paint Bonamici as a candidate weak on crime, by asking her about certain votes she took in 2009. We’ll focus on just one of those statements. "And in another bill that same year, you were the only vote in the entire state Senate against keeping repeat drunk drivers off the road," Cornilles said. House Bill 2238, now law, increased the penalty for refusing to take a breath test. Before the legislation, a person who refused could qualify for a hardship driving permit after 90 days or maybe one year, depending on the driver’s previous record. Now, the minimum is 90 days — and the maximum is three years. Bonamici was the only no vote in Senate committee and on the Senate floor. Her campaign manager Carol Butler said Bonamici wanted to stop people from driving drunk in the first place, not fiddle with legislation that addressed the problem after the fact. In her five years in the Legislature, Bonamici has voted for many bills that crack down on drunk driving. But in this instance, Cornilles is correct. She was the sole no vote. We rate the statement True.	None	Rob Cornilles	None	None	None	2012-01-14T00:00:00	2012-01-10	['None']
pomt-13216	"What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/hillary-clinton/what-hillary-clintons-plans-mean-us-debt/	At the third and final presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace said both candidates are ignoring concerns about the rising national debt. "The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years," Wallace said Oct. 19, 2016. "Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Question is -- why are both of you ignoring this problem?" Trump said the basis of the question was wrong because he will "create tremendous jobs." Clinton, meanwhile, said she pays for everything she proposes, primarily by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans. "What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt," Clinton said. Is that right? Yes and no. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy group, says Clinton’s plans would increase the debt by a relatively small amount, $200 billion over a decade "above current law levels." The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan would generate an additional $275 billion to cancel out that debt increase. However the numbers shake out, the debt would still grow by $9 trillion over 10 years because of interest payments related to the U.S. debt and projected spending on Social Security and Medicare. "Interest on the debt will become the fastest growing part of federal spending. In 2017, the next president will inherit a government projected to spend over $300 billion on interest payments that year alone, an amount that grows to more than $800 billion by 2025 — more than the current combined federal spending on the Defense Department, education, transportation, and medical research," wrote Bob Bixby and Maya MacGuineas for the Brookings Institution. So, as Wallace said, without further changes, debt would rise to above 86 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product under Clinton’s plan. For the record, Wallace was also correct that the debt would grow faster if Trump is elected, according to independent researchers. Here’s a chart spelling it out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "We are encouraged that Clinton continues to largely pay for her new spending and that Trump has made substantial improvements to his plan, including a less costly tax plan and new spending cuts," the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote. "Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented a proposal to address our growing national debt and put it on a more sustainable path, nor have they offered a proposal for shoring up the Social Security, Medicare, or Highway trust funds. As it currently stands, Donald Trump’s proposals would still substantially worsen the debt." Our ruling Clinton said, "What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt." An independent analysis found Clinton’s proposals would add a relatively small amount to the debt, $200 billion over a decade. The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan will address that, though the proposal hasn’t been independently analyzed. Regardless, Clinton’s explanation leaves out the fact that debt would still rise by about $9 trillion over 10 years because of current policies. Clinton’s proposals don’t stem that increase. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/30d13ea3-9259-4377-a2ff-ce6ecb7fb0c3 Update (Oct. 24, 2016): This article has been updated to reflect that one of the reasons the debt will increase is because of projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.

pomt-14442	"(Flint, Mich., is) paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/bernie-sanders/flint-residents-dont-pay-3-times-much-burlington-r/	Sen. Bernie Sanders said during a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., that government officials have added insult to injury by charging citizens astronomical utility rates for lead-tainted water. An audience member who lives in Flint asked both Sanders and Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton what they would do to help Flint’s residents regain their trust in government. Sanders called the state response "a disgrace beyond belief" and said that if he were president, the federal government would take over when a state is incapable of resolving such a crisis. The first place he would start is with dealing with the high price of water. "What is absolutely incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint," Sanders said on March 6, 2016. "You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water." HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER With all the problems with Flint’s water supply, we wondered if it was accurate that Burlington pays one-third the price for service. We learned Flint did indeed have exorbitantly high rates for water that was poisoned with lead, but the numbers have recently dropped from the level Sanders is citing. Rate debate The water crisis emerged after Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager to oversee policy decisions in Flint, a majority African-American city ravaged by poverty following a drastic decline in the manufacturing industry. With the power to overrule local officials, then-emergency manager Michael Brown enacted a 35 percent water rate increase to shore up utilities in 2012 (remember this, because we’re coming back to it). Officials opted in April 2013 to stop getting water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and join a new pipeline project called the Karegnondi Water Authority. But the pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron wasn’t finished. While the infrastructure was being built, the city began drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014. At this point, it was already apparent water was exceptionally expensive in Flint. In June 2014, the Flint Journal reported that the city charged $35 more per month for water and sewer service than the next-highest rates in Genesee County. The Flint River’s corrosive water leached lead from pipes into the city’s supply. After months of complaints from residents, the national media started exposing the issue in the second half of 2015. (You can read a detailed review in our story here.) We didn’t hear back from the Sanders campaign about his statement. But at least one source has said Flint had the highest residential water rates in the country. Food & Water Watch, an environmental nonprofit that advocates for public utility ownership, surveyed average annual water rates for the 500 largest systems in the United States. They found that in January 2015, Flint’s average water bill was $910 per year. Unfortunately, that doesn’t include Burlington (population 42,000), but we can still compare it to Flint’s 100,000 or so residents by looking at the two city’s water rates. If you’ve ever read your own water bill, you know sussing out how you get charged is a little perplexing. But all you really need to know is that Food & Water Watch came up with their total by measuring the cost of the average household’s annual drinking water use, which is about 60,000 gallons per year. That translates to about 8,021 cubic feet, and utilities often use cubic feet to set their rates. Food & Water Watch also included meter charges that utilities may bill their customers. Flint customers were charged at least $22.90 for a typical home meter, but Burlington Public Works doesn’t charge a meter fee. Both cities’ water departments confirmed the rates we’re using. Just to further complicate things: Do you remember that 35 percent emergency rate increase from 2012? A judge ruled in August 2015 that the increase had to be rolled back because the city misused $15.7 million in water funds to settle a lawsuit. The city also must repay those millions. Because of the relatively recent change, we decided to compare Burlington and Flint both before the judge’s ruling and after: City Residential rate per 100 cubic feet Water meter charge Average annual bill for 8,021 cubic feet Flint, January 2015 $7.92 $22.90 $910 Flint, after August 2015 ruling $6.19 $17.88 $770 Burlington $4.00 $0 $321 Flint’s residential water rates used to essentially be twice Burlington’s at the start of 2015, but were about 55 percent higher after the judge ruled the rates rolled back. Neither one of those figures is three times as much as Burlington, like Sanders said. But that hefty meter fee makes a big difference. We’re including it because you had to pay it if your house in Flint had water service, raising your bill significantly. When we look at average annual bills from January 2015, Sanders’ 3-to-1 comparison is pretty close. But after August, Flint customers were paying a little more than twice as much as Burlington residents. Our ruling Sanders said, "You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water." Going back to January 2015, we find that’s the case, as long as we include both water rates and water meter charges in Flint. But after a judge rolled Flint’s rates back in August 2015, people there are paying a little more than twice as much as people in Burlington. His numbers are no longer entirely accurate, but Sanders has a point that Flint’s water bills are gallingly expensive. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/820c0c1f-1041-4c51-be7d-bf909a9c763a	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-03-07T17:07:09	2016-03-06	['Michigan', 'Vermont', 'Flint,_Michigan', 'Burlington,_Vermont']
pomt-10297	"First, he (Obama) opposed the surge. Then he confidently predicted that it would fail. Then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/john-mccain/obama-tried-to-defund-troops-not-exactly/	Sen. John McCain went into attack mode in a recent speech before the Disabled American Veterans convention in Las Vegas. "With just three months to go before the election, a lot of folks are still trying to square Senator Obama's varying positions on the surge in Iraq," McCain told the veterans in the Aug. 11, 2008, speech. "First, he opposed the surge. Then he confidently predicted that it would fail. Then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge." It was a three-pronged attack, and it prompted us to check whether Obama indeed opposed the surge, predicted it would fail, and tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried it out. The first two prongs are clearly true. On Jan. 10, 2007, the day President Bush called for an additional 21,500 troops to try to stabilize Iraq, Obama spoke out against the plan and predicted it would fail to stop the violence. "I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there," he told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann. "In fact, I think it will do the reverse. I think it takes pressure off the Iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there. So I am going to actively oppose the president's proposal." He followed through on that promise on Feb. 17, 2007, when he voted to support a bill expressing that "Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq." The motion failed in a vote of 56 yeas to 34 nays, with three-fifths required to move it forward. Obama continued to predict the surge would not prompt the sort of political reconciliation necessary to end violence in Iraq. On July 18, 2007, Obama told Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show, "My assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now." He continued: "And it is my assessment and the American people's assessment that this strategy has not worked, that al-Qaida has gotten stronger in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that we are fighting on the wrong battlefield and the Iraqi government has not done the work it needs to do to resolve the civil war in Iraq." So yes, Obama opposed the surge and predicted it would fail. Now, did Obama try to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge? The evidence the McCain campaign cited to support that claim is Obama's vote of May 24, 2007, against an appropriations bill that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (and passed, 80-14). "That was the moment that Barack Obama voted to cut off funding for the troops who were in Iraq and carrying out the surge," McCain spokesman Joseph Pounder told us in an e-mail exchange. First of all, the bill in question funded all of the ongoing military operations in both theaters, not just "the troops who carried out the surge," as McCain's comment implied. Secondly, it's misleading to say Obama didn't want to fund "the troops." He said he would support a bill that included a plan for bringing troops home. "We must fund our troops," Obama said. "But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly." If that one vote of Obama's constituted an attempt to "prevent funding to the troops," then almost every Republican in the Senate did the same when they voted against a $124-billion appropriations bill on April 26, 2007, that would have funded operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also required Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq. (McCain missed the vote on that bill, which passed 51-46 and was subsequently vetoed by Bush.) It wasn't the idea of funding the troops that Bush and the other Republicans were opposing, it was the strategy that the bill would have enabled. Likewise, it wasn't "the troops" Obama was trying to defund with his May 24, 2007 vote, it was Bush's war strategy. So the first two prongs of McCain's attack were accurate, while the third was not. Since McCain was two-thirds correct, we considered giving him a Mostly True on this one. But the misleading portion of the attack was the most provocative — painting Obama as opposed to the well-being of the troops. We're calling it Half True.

pomt-05371	"There has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/09/nia-gill/state-sen-nia-gill-claims-new-jersey-has-not-had-d/	New Jersey has a long-standing reputation as a Democratic state, but not since the late 1970s has a Democratic woman represented the Garden State as a member of Congress. State Sen. Nia Gill pointed out that history in an interview Monday on NJToday about her bid for the 10th Congressional District seat previously held by the late Donald Payne. Gill is one of the Democrats running in the June 5 primary to represent the district, which spans Essex, Hudson and Union counties. "There has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades," said Gill, who is African-American. "There has never been an African-American woman ever elected to Congress from the State of New Jersey." While a Republican congresswoman represented New Jersey as recently as 10 years ago, Gill is right that a Democratic woman from the state has not served in Congress since U.S. Rep. Helen Stevenson Meyner served two terms from 1975 to 1979, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Gill is one of six Democratic women seeking their party’s nomination on June 5 for four congressional seats throughout New Jersey. Democratic candidates for the other eight seats are all men. The state’s current congressional delegation includes six Democrats and six Republicans, but no women. The seat held by Payne, who was a Democrat, remains vacant. First, let’s talk about the history of New Jersey women serving in Congress. Five women -- including three Republicans and two Democrats -- have represented New Jersey in Congress. The first representative was Democrat Mary T. Norton, known as "Battling Mary," who served 12 terms between 1925 and 1951. The other representatives and their years of service are as follows: Florence P. Dwyer (R), 1957-1973; Helen Stevenson Meyner (D), 1975-1979; Millicent Fenwick (R), 1975-1983; and Marge Roukema (R), 1981-2003. Now, we’ll discuss the service of Meyner, the last Democratic congresswoman. Meyner -- who was married to former New Jersey Gov. Robert Meyner -- first ran for Congress in 1972, when the original Democratic nominee withdrew from the race for failing to meet the federal citizenship requirement. At the time, that congressional district spanned Hunterdon, Sussex, Warren, Mercer and Morris counties. That year, Meyner lost to Republican Joseph J. Maraziti, but she defeated Maraziti in the 1974 election. Meyner narrowly won re-election in 1976 over Republican challenger William Schluter. During her four years in Congress, Meyner "developed a reputation as a thoughtful internationalist and advocate of human rights issues," according to her profile on the House website, "Women in Congress." Meyner was a critic of the nuclear arms race as well as human rights abuses in the Philippines. She opposed attempts to suspend or expel Israel from the United Nations. Meyner also helped to prevent her district’s Picatinny Arsenal from shutting down and sought to sustain the state’s ailing textile industry. "In her first term, she supported legislation that aided destitute women, including a vote to provide federal funding for abortions through Medicare," according to her profile. However, in the face of high inflation, rising gas prices and a lagging economy, Meyner lost her bid for a third term in 1978. She was defeated by Republican James A. Courter by just under 5,500 votes. To learn more about Meyner’s service, check out her complete profile here. Our ruling In an interview Monday on NJToday, Gill claimed: "There has not been a Democratic woman in Congress from New Jersey in almost four decades." That history lesson is accurate, because the last Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey was Meyner, who served two terms between 1975 and 1979. The most recent congresswoman from either party was Marge Roukema, a Republican who left office in 2003. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

Peter King brushed off a new Senate report on the CIA interrogation program as a partisan, one-sided account. Nothing to see here, people. Move along. During a Dec. 9 appearance on a local radio station, King, a New York Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterintelligence & Terrorism, said that the CIA tactics were "rough, they were tough, but they were not torture." He went on to downplay the report’s findings. "This is not a case where people were killed," he said. "We’re not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that," he added. "We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions, have water put into their nose and into their mouth. But again, nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this." The Senate Intelligence Committee began investigating the scope of the CIA Enhanced Interrogation Program in 2009. On Dec. 9, committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., released the executive summary of the committee’s review of the program, which began in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. It alleges the program was not effective in gathering intelligence, CIA officials lied to Congress and the president about its effectiveness, the program was poorly managed, and the tactics were more brutal than people were told. Those conclusions are contested by many CIA officials and some Senate Republicans, who wrote a 160-page minority opinion. However, many details uncovered by the report, on which King was commenting, don’t appear to be disputed and are based on 6.3 million pages of documents and CIA cables reviewed by Senate staff. Even an ancillary reading of the Senate report’s executive summary — a 600-page document that is only one-tenth of the still-classified full study — finds King’s comments to be dubious. King’s staff did not respond to requests for comment. "Not a case where people were killed" Let’s put to bed one false claim King made off the bat: that no one was killed. In fact, someone did die as a result of the interrogation program. In 2002, the CIA interrogated Gul Rahman at Cobalt, an overseas detention center with an undisclosed location described as a dungeon. Many of the controversial interrogations outlined in the report took place at Cobalt. Rahman, described in the report as a suspected Islamic extremist, underwent "48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower, and rough treatment," according to communications with CIA headquarters. Later, Rahman was shackled to the wall and made to lie on a cold concrete floor. He was stripped of all of his clothes except a sweatshirt. In the morning, guards discovered Rahman was dead, likely from hypothermia. "Not talking about anyone being burned or stabbed or cut or anything like that" The report describes how detainees at Cobalt were subject to something called "rough takedowns" that included physical abuse. "Approximately five CIA officers would scream at a detainee, drag him outside of his cell, cut his clothes off, and secure him with Mylar tape. The detainee would then be hooded and dragged up and down a long corridor while being slapped and punched." These takedowns were "thoroughly planned and rehearsed" and did cause physical harm to detainees. Rahman, for example, had abrasions on his face, legs, and hands, medical examiners found. One of the most discussed elements of the CIA report is the use of "rectal feeding" or "rectal rehydration." In at least five cases, detainees were force fed through their anus. In one instance, a lunch of "hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was ‘pureed’ and rectally infused" into a detainee named Majid Khan, the report said. While current and former CIA officials have defended the practice as medically necessary, Physicians for Human Rights said in a statement that rectal feedings are, "a form of sexual assault masquerading as medical treatment." The CIA’s chief of interrogations characterized rectal feeding as a demonstration of "total control," the report said. Additionally, an unidentified individual in the report said the procedure was used to make people talk and helped to "clear a person’s head." One detainee, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, as a result of rectal feeding was "later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse," the report said. These instances of physical harm directly contradict King’s description. "We’re talking about people being made to stand in awkward in positions" King’s statement significantly downplays what detainees endured. For starters, they were not just made to stand in awkward positions. That tactic was used in addition to sleep deprivation methods that required detainees remain awake for up to 180 hours. Additionally, two detainees broke bones in their feet while trying to escape capture. Despite a CIA physician recommending they stay off their feet for several weeks, the two detainees were placed in "standing sleep deprivation." One of the detainees was kept awake on his feet for 52 hours, the other for an undisclosed amount of time. Similar tactics were used on a detainee with a sprained ankle and on a detainee with a prosthetic leg. Detainees were often naked and shackled with their hands above their head in complete darkness and loud music blasting. In April 2006, President George W. Bush "expressed discomfort" when shown images of a detainee "chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper, and forced to go to the bathroom on himself," according to the reports’ account of CIA documents. "Nobody suffered any lasting injuries from this" You could probably successfully argue that death is a pretty lasting injury. As were the chronic hemorrhoids and anal fissure suffered by the detainee who faced rectal feeding. But there were additional injuries as well. Abu Zubaydah, a high-level target, was captured in a raid during which he sustained a gunshot wound. Despite the obvious need for medical attention, care was instead withheld to convey that it was contingent on Zubaydah’s cooperation. The wound eventually deteriorated due to a "combination of a lack of hygiene, sub-optimal nutrition, inadvertent trauma to the wound secondary to some of the stress techniques utilized at that stage, and the removal of formal obvious medical care," the report said. Zubaydah also lost an eye in custody and was subjected to waterboarding, a procedure that simulates drowning. In one session, he "became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth." He was revived and vomited large amounts of water. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often described as the architect of the 9-11 plots, was waterboarded 183 times over 15 sessions. While King alleged no lasting injuries from this technique, the report indicates otherwise, said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University. "Methods were approved that if used only very sporadically might not have caused permanent damage, but they were used in combination and repeatedly over a course of sometimes weeks or months," Schanzer said. "I think to write off those kinds of compounded injuries as being insignificant is totally inconsistent with the facts." Our ruling King said, "Nobody suffered any lasting injuries" as a result of the CIA enhanced interrogation program. He also said downplayed the methods, claiming it was "not a case where people were killed," and that the techniques amounted to "people being made to stand in awkward in positions." This is the opposite of what the report showed. One need not agree with everything in it to conclude that someone did die, an eye was lost, detainees were made to stand on broken limbs and deprived of sleep for 180 hours. It’s as if King didn’t read the report before he went on the radio. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Peter King	None	None	None	2014-12-15T14:53:17	2014-12-09	['None']

pomt-00472	China has "not acted so well with our elections. They’ve tampered with our elections quite a bit."	false	/california/statements/2018/aug/14/jeff-denham/no-evidence-back-denhams-claim-china-tampered-us-e/	California Congressman Jeff Denham recently called China’s tariffs "a big deal" for Central Valley farmers, especially the 50 percent tariff on almonds grown throughout his Stanislaus County district. A moment later, in the same interview on the 209 Podcast, the Republican claimed China is a big threat for another reason: Interfering in U.S. elections "quite a bit." "China has been a good partner on a lot of issues. They’ve backed us up with North Korea. They are a good trading partner, even though they’ve not acted so well with our elections. They’ve tampered with our elections quite a bit," Denham said in the July 24, 2018 interview. Denham makes his claim at the 15:00 minute mark in the video above. Russia, not China, has been the focus of a U.S. investigation into election meddling since 2016. The Russian government, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, interfered in the 2016 presidential election through a widespread hacking and misinformation campaign. In their January 2017 report, the agencies said: "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments." Russia’s interference remains the focus of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation. But we wanted to know whether there’s evidence showing China has "tampered with our elections quite a bit," as Denham claimed. We decided to fact-check that very specific and serious charge. Background on Denham Denham is seeking his fifth term representing California’s 10th Congressional District. He is being challenged by Democrat Josh Harder, a college instructor and businessman. The race is considered one of four toss ups in California by the Cook Political Report. Denham sits on House committees on transportation, agriculture and natural resources, but doesn’t sit on any panels that would regularly discuss elections or foreign interference. His office did not say the claim comes from classified information. Similar claim rated False Denham’s statement that China has interfered in U.S. elections isn’t common. But there was one high-profile allegation fact-checked last year by PolitiFact Wisconsin. In July 2017, then White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus said on "Fox News Sunday" that "It’s an absolute fact" that China and North Korea "have consistently over many, many years" meddled in U.S. elections. To assess that, PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted a dozen Asian studies and international affairs experts who either said they were unaware of any evidence to back Priebus’ claim or only aware of one example from two decades ago. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Priebus’ claim False, a rating we’ll keep in mind. Still no evidence We contacted several of the same experts to find out whether any new information about China had come to light over the past year, since the recent fact check. Four experts responded and said there’s still nothing to support the claim that China has consistently interfered in U.S. elections. Like many other countries, China does try to influence the American political process, particularly through lobbying. That’s not the same, the experts said, as the pervasive Russian meddling in elections. "I don’t think that there’s any evidence of China as a government acting to interfere in the elections in order to either disrupt the process or to tip the election one way or the other," said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied Russian election interference. Herrera is the former director of the school’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia. "I see no indication from U.S. officials, from intelligence officials, that suggests China has been meddling in U.S. elections," added Robert Ross, political science professor at Boston College and associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. There’s little doubt that China has the technological ability to interfere in U.S. elections, Ross said. But its government is likely showing restraint in this arena, he said, because such action would draw negative attention from the U.S. and distract from China’s other goals, such as its military buildup in the South China Sea. "I know of no evidence that China has tampered with US elections," Susan Shirk, a UC San Diego research professor and chair of the 21st Century China Center at the school, wrote in an email. "China is increasing its efforts at public diplomacy/propaganda, to get people to have a positive view of China, but there are no reports of campaign contributions or meddling with the online information environment similar to those made about Russia." Denham’s response Asked to support the statement, Denham’s spokeswoman Emily Carlin wrote in an email that China’s tampering in U.S. elections was "commonly accepted facts." She then rephrased what the congressman said, writing, "As far as Chinese efforts to influence our political process, there has been increasing evidence of this." She provided links to news articles from NPR, CNBC and CBS SF Bay Area, along with a U.S. intelligence report to support the claim. And while that material shows China poses a cyber and espionage threat and has run disinformation campaigns in Taiwan and Austrailia, it includes no claims China has interfered or tampered with U.S. elections. Alleged Chinese spy In her response, Denham’s spokeswoman cited news reports that a staffer who once worked for U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein had a connection to Chinese spying. Victor Shih, an associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego, said, however, there’s no indication the staffer had any role in election interference. Shih said another matter from the 1990s, and not cited by Denham’s office, does show one "clear case of China trying to influence elections." In 1996, Johnny Chung, a Taiwanese-born California businessman, pleaded guilty to illegally funneling money from China to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic National Committee during Clinton’s re-election campaign. Chung later testified before Congress that the donations included $35,000 from the head of China's military intelligence agency to Clinton’s successful reelection effort. The FBI even warned six members of Congress at the time: "We have reason to believe that the government of China may try to make contributions to members of Congress through Asian donors." Shih and the other experts we contacted said, however, the Chung matter does not represent a widespread, persistent effort by China to interfere in U.S. elections. China is suspected, he added, of conducting a recent and broad political influence campaign in Australia. "Meddling, of course, there are some cases of it (by China in the United States)," Shih said. "But to say that it’s pervasive or everywhere, I think it’s a bit of a stretch." Citing Denham’s words, Herrera added that "Tamper suggests … breaking into something or inappropriately changing something. It doesn’t just suggest buying influence, for example." Our ruling Congressman Jeff Denham recently claimed China has "tampered with our elections quite a bit." Last year, PolitiFact Wisconsin surveyed a dozen international affairs experts to examine a similar claim and found no evidence China has conducted widespread election interference. It found one case in 1996 of illegal campaign contributions by a Taiwanese-born California businessman to Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign. The example, however, was not part of a sustained, pervasive election interference. Experts said they consider it an example of buying influence, but not comprehensive election tampering. We reached four experts to ask whether any information over the past year had changed their assessment. They told us there’s still nothing to support the charge that China has "tampered with our elections quite a bit." They added that China, like many countries, does attempt to influence America’s political process, mainly through lobbying, but does not have a record of election meddling anywhere approaching Russia’s. We rate Denham’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After we published our fact check, Denham’s office provided additional news reports, contending "there is significantly more of a case" for the congressman’s claim than we showed in our fact check. The articles, which center on China’s alleged hacking of the Obama and McCain presidential campaigns in 2008, were not part of the congressman’s initial response. But we reviewed them and consulted several experts on China to evaluate whether they, in fact, make more of a case for Denham’s statement. Denham’s office pointed mainly to an NBC News investigation published in June 2013. It quoted Dennis Blair, President Obama’s director of national intelligence in 2009 and 2010, as saying: "Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyberespionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties. They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China." The NBC report added: "The goal of the campaign intrusion, according to (U.S. Intelligence) officials: to export massive amounts of internal data from both campaigns—including internal position papers and private emails of key advisers in both camps." Robert Ross of the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University told us in an email the 2008 hacking case "does not show evidence of tampering in elections, but rather of an espionage campaign aimed at collecting intelligence on the likely US policies of US presidential candidates." "In this respect," he added, "it is no different from any other intelligence collection effort. This was not tampering, but rather collection. There is a difference between such operations that must not be overlooked." Ross said the difference is that tampering aims to influence political outcomes in the United States, while intelligence collection "aims to improve the foreign policies of the state collecting the intelligence." Additional experts said even if the 2008 case was considered "tampering," they would still take issue with Denham’s characterization of China tampering with U.S. elections "quite a bit." "Folks from the government may know more, but I have not seen any pervasive patterns," wrote Victor Shih, associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego. The additional information from Denham’s office supports the idea that China has conducted widespread intelligence collection to influence America’s political process. But that’s not the same as tampering, which we and the experts we spoke with interpreted as attempting to alter election results, such as Russia’s effort in 2016. Even if it did fit that category, it would not be "quite a bit." Our rating on Denham’s claim remains the same: False.

pomt-04193	"In 2008, tourism brought in $38 billion dollars and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the state of New Jersey."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/09/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-new-jersey-tourism-generates/	Jersey resilience may not be the only factor driving the need to rebuild in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. Tourism dollars also are at stake, to the tune of a total that exceeds the Garden State’s nearly $32 billion budget. Sen. Frank Lautenberg discussed the wrath of Sandy, President Obama’s visit to New Jersey to inspect the damage, and the importance of the state’s tourism industry during a Nov. 13 speech on the Senate floor. "I joined President Obama in his visit to the area. For many people in my State, the boardwalk isn't just a source of pride, it's a source of critical income to our state," according to Lautenberg’s speech published in The Congressional Record. "In 2008, tourism brought in $38 billion dollars and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the state of New Jersey. Families came from all over the country to walk the boardwalk in Atlantic City or take a fishing boat out of one of our ports, Point Pleasant or one of the others, or ride the roller coaster at a pier in Seaside Heights." For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the senator’s claim about tourism in 2008 and the number of jobs created in that field. Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray said the senator’s statement wasn’t meant to imply that New Jersey received $38 billion in tax revenue for 2008. Instead, Gray said, Lautenberg was referring to the overall financial impact tourism has on the Garden State. "Senator Lautenberg was referring to the amount of money spent on tourism in New Jersey and he is right that tourism is a huge generator of revenue for New Jersey businesses," Gray said in an e-mail. "Senator Lautenberg will continue working in Washington to convince his colleagues about the need for disaster relief and to rebuild the state's $38 billion tourism industry." How widespread is tourism in New Jersey’s economy? A 2008 tourism economic impact study shows that the bulk of tourism spending that year -- 33.4 percent -- was in the greater Atlantic City region. The Shore area, from about Monmouth/Ocean counties down to Cape May, was next, at 28.4 percent; Gateway area (northern New Jersey), 21.5 percent; Delaware River region, 9.2 percent; Skylands region (northwestern part of state), 7.4 percent. New Jersey tourism spending dipped a bit during the recession, but numbers have remained strong, with spending at $38.8 billion, revenues (federal, state and local taxes) at $7.7 billion and tourism-related jobs at 359,000. Here's a look at New Jersey tourism during the past five years: YEAR EXPENDITURES REVENUES JOBS (visitor-related spending) (federal, state, local taxes) 2007 $38 bllion $7.9 billion 381,900 2008 $38.8 billion $7.7 billion 359,900 2009 $35.2 billion $7.2 billion 314,000 2010 $35.5 billion $7.2 billion 309,000 2011 $38 billion $9.2 billion 312,000 Sources: Annual tourism economic impact study statements at New Jersey Travel and Tourism website: http://www.visitnj.org/new-jersey-tourism-research-and-information So, the senator’s numbers are correct: New Jersey tourism’s industry in 2008 generated $38 billion and the industry created or supported more than 300,000 jobs. We ran the numbers by the New Jersey Department of Travel and Tourism. "Suffice it to say from where we sit that New Jersey has a $38 billion tourism industry that is vital to our state’s economy, and Senator Lautenberg certainly understands this as well," Ernest Landante Jr., a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of State, said in an e-mail. Our ruling Lautenberg, New Jersey’s senior senator, said Nov. 13 on the Senate floor that "in 2008, tourism brought in $38 billion dollars and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the state of New Jersey." Economic impact studies show that the tourism industry in New Jersey has hovered in the mid-$30 billion range for the past five years, except in 2009 and 2010, when the state was still emerging from the recession. Lautenberg is correct that the state’s tourism industry generated $38 billion in 2008 and supported more than 300,000 jobs that year. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12438	The federal tax code includes "deductions for birds flying across America."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-mentions-tax-deductions-birds-flying-/	There were a number of head-scratching exchanges in President Donald Trump’s interview with The Economist posted on May 11, including Trump’s claim -- easily debunked -- that he had coined the phrase "prime the pump." But one line that raised our eyebrows was about tax deductions for birds. "I get more deductions," Trump said. "I mean I can tell you this, I get more deductions. They have deductions for birds flying across America. They have deductions for everything." At first, we were mystified at what Trump was talking about. But as it turns out, he’s on target -- and as a golf course owner, he has reason to know about this obscure part of the federal tax code. We’ll walk you through it. The tax deductions in question involve what are known as "conservation easements." A conservation easement for a parcel of land is an agreement by which the landowner pledges to forgo future development. This way, the land remains in its natural state and, among other things, can provide habitat for animals, including migratory birds. In typical easements, the landowner continues to own the land itself, but the right to develop it is donated to a nonprofit organization that promises not to build on it. The difference between the pre-donation value of the land and the post-donation value of the land can be deducted on the landowner’s tax returns as a gift, said Steven Barshov, a land-use and environmental-law attorney at the firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, P.C. The exact loss in land value is determined by an appraiser. For large or expensive parcels of land, the tax break can be substantial -- it can eliminate up to half of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (or all of it, if they are a farmer or a rancher). And if the amount of the gift is greater than one year’s adjusted gross income, the balance can be carried over through up to 15 future tax years until the value of the donation is exhausted. Compared to popular tax deductions like those for the interest on home mortgages, deductions for conservation easements are relatively small. Still, they add up: Bloomberg reported that in 2010, almost 3,000 taxpayers used conservation easements to deduct $766 million from their tax returns, according to IRS data. As recently as 2007, that amount was as high as $2.2 billion. Where they have come in for criticism is for disproportionately benefiting the ultra-rich. Indeed, for a time, the administration of President Barack Obama tried to get rid of the tax break. "They’re overwhelmingly for high-end individuals and provide little to no benefit to the public," Dean Zerbe, who examined easement donations as a Republican aide on the Senate Finance Committee, told Bloomberg. "I don’t know if I could design a tax break that’s more targeted toward the millionaire set." This may explain why this particular tax deduction popped into Trump’s head during the Economist interview. Forbes noted that when Trump gave the Associated Press a 94-page list of $102 million in charitable donations he had made since 2010, one of the entries was $63.825 million for "various conservation easements." The White House did not respond to a request for information about easements, but according to Forbes, Trump has donated easements for land on the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles and the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Beyond the golf-course easements, Trump has also donated easements for his personal estate in Westchester County, N.Y., as well as his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Forbes reported. Easements for golf courses have been particularly controversial, but they have been upheld in the courts, albeit with some restrictions. In one case, the U.S. Tax Court denied a deduction for an easement because the golf course used chemicals that rendered the land unsuitable for wildlife habitat. But in a 2009 case, the Kiva Dunes golf course in Alabama won its case to claim the deduction after demonstrating that it was used by 46 species of neotropical birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico. The court’s only quibble was the valuation; the donation’s value was reduced from $30.6 million to $28.7 million. "Protection of significant wildlife habitat is a conservation purpose qualifying a conservation easement for a charitable deduction," David Wooldridge, the Alabama attorney who represented the golf course, told PolitiFact. There’s at least one other provision of the tax code where migratory bird habitat could qualify a landowner for tax deductions. "In general, farm landowners and tenants can deduct expenses related to soil or water conservation, farmland erosion prevention, or endangered species recovery from their federal taxes, where otherwise these would be considered capital expenses," according to a guide for land conservation published by Texas A&M University. To qualify for this deduction requires a nearby endangered species and a conservation plan approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For the record, neither tax benefit applies only or specifically to birds. Our ruling Trump said the federal tax code includes "deductions for birds flying across America." He’s right -- conservation easements to protect wildlife, including but not limited to migratory birds, can be used as tax deductions. And Trump should know -- by all indications, he’s saved millions in tax payments on the backs of these little creatures. We rate the statement True.

pomt-09872	President Barack Obama suggested on national TV that the Democratic health care bill "will have government decide" that a healthy, 100-year-old woman in need of a pacemaker "should take a pain pill" instead.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/03/dan-lungren/lungren-says-obama-would-have-government-require-c/	Rep. Dan Lungren, a Republican from California, says President Barack Obama's health care plan is so mixed up that the government would tell 100-year-old ladies who need pacemakers to take pain pills instead. During a speech on the House floor on July 28, 2009, Lungren cited comments that Obama made in a TV special to suggest that Obama's plan was callous and bureaucratic. "If we are being told that this week we have to make the decision as to whether or not the program we put forward will have government decide whether a 100-year-old woman who is in extraordinarily good health but needs a pacemaker ought to instead be told by the government that merely she should take a pain pill — as the president suggested on television not too long ago — then maybe we owe it to the American people to give ourselves sufficient time” to study this legislation further. Lungren was referring to remarks Obama made during the ABC News' June 24 special, Questions for the President: Prescription for America, which was anchored by Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. We went to the transcript of the event and found that Lungren is distorting Obama's words. While Obama did bring up the example of patients and their families possibly having to choose between a pill and a pacemaker at some point, he did it as a hypothetical example while emphasizing that the government’s role should be to provide background information so that patients and doctors can better sort through thorny, end-of-life issues. The exchange began when Sawyer introduced Jane Sturm, who takes care of her mother, Hazel, now 105. When Hazel was 100, Sturm said, the doctor told her she needed a pacemaker. Both mother and daughter said they were game, but an arrhythmia specialist initially said no, before seeing Hazel’s “joy of life” in person. Sturm asked the president, “Outside the medical criteria for prolonging life for somebody elderly, is there any consideration that can be given for a certain spirit, a certain joy of living, quality of life? Or is it just a medical cutoff at a certain age?” After joking that he’d like to meet Sturm’s mother and “find out what she’s eating,” the president said, “I don't think that we can make judgments based on peoples' spirit. That would be a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that say that we are going to provide good, quality care for all people.” After Gibson interjected with a comment about how money may not have been available for a pacemaker, Obama responded, “Well, and — and that's absolutely true. And end-of-life care is one of the most difficult sets of decisions that we're going to have to make. I don't want bureaucracies making those decisions, but understand that those decisions are already being made in one way or another. If they're not being made under Medicare and Medicaid, they're being made by private insurers. We don't always make those decisions explicitly. We often make those decisions by just letting people run out of money or making the deductibles so high or the out-of-pocket expenses so onerous that they just can't afford the care.” Obama continued, “And all we're suggesting — and we're not going to solve every difficult problem in terms of end-of-life care. A lot of that is going to have to be, we as a culture and as a society starting to make better decisions within our own families and for ourselves. But what we can do is make sure that at least some of the waste that exists in the system that's not making anybody's mom better, that is loading up on additional tests or additional drugs that the evidence shows is not necessarily going to improve care, that at least we can let doctors know and your mom know that, you know what? Maybe this isn't going to help. Maybe you're better off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller. And those kinds of decisions between doctors and patients, and making sure that our incentives are not preventing those good decisions, and that — that doctors and hospitals all are aligned for patient care, that's something we can achieve.” Looking at the full transcript, it’s clear that Obama voluntarily brought up the example of having to choose between a surgery and a pill. But he did so as a hypothetical example of difficult decisions about medical treatment for older patients. He was not advocating, much less requiring, bureaucrats to make a potentially life-ending decision for a centenarian. “I don’t want bureaucracies making those decisions,” Obama said. One can be skeptical about whether Obama’s promises to keep the government out of doctor-patient decisionmaking will hold if health care legislation becomes a reality. But Lungren goes beyond that to distort what the president actually said. We rate Lungren’s claim False.

pomt-13389	According to "independent experts," Donald Trump's tax plan "would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correctly-cites-outside-analyses-t/	During the first presidential debate of 2016, Hillary Clinton took aim at Donald Trump’s latest tax plan, saying it would explode the debt and hike taxes for some middle-class Americans. "Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that (his tax plan) would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy," Clinton said. The Clinton campaign pointed us to an analysis by Lily L. Batchelder, a professor at New York University Law School. When we asked her whether Clinton’s phrasing accurately summarized her findings, Batchelder said it did. "Yep, that’s totally accurate," she told PolitiFact. We’ll look at the two parts of Clinton’s statement in turn, focusing on the revised plan Trump unveiled at a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 15, 2016. (Click the links for details on the plans.) Debt increase In her paper, published a little more than a week after Trump offered his revised plan, Batchelder wrote that her calculations suggested that "Donald Trump’s latest tax plan would cost more than $5 trillion over 10 years." One can argue that Batchelder is not an "independent expert" -- she worked for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus as chief tax counsel of the Senate Finance Committee from 2010 to 2014 and as the deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama in 2014 and 2015. However, a more conservative group, the Tax Foundation, came up with a similar calculation in its own analysis. According to its model, Trump’s plan "would reduce federal revenue" -- in other words, add to the debt -- "by between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion" without taking into account increased economic growth estimates due to the plan’s tax cuts. (The Tax Foundation did note that this debt increase was smaller than what it had projected for earlier versions of Trump’s plan.) Finally, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors deficit reduction, wrote that its update found that "both Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law – though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more. ... Specifically, we estimate Clinton’s plans would add $200 billion to the debt over the next decade, while Trump’s plans would add $5.3 trillion." So Clinton seems on solid ground for this part of the statement. Tax hikes Batchelder’s paper is the primary evidence here (along with a separate analysis by a liberal group, Citizens for Tax Justice). "Despite its enormous price tag, his plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low- and middle-income families with children, with especially large tax increases for working single parents," Batchelder wrote. "I conservatively estimate that Trump’s plan would increase taxes for roughly 7.8 million families with minor children. These families who would pay more taxes represent roughly 20 percent of households with minor children and more than half of single parents. They include roughly 25 million individuals and 15 million children." Batchelder cites several reasons for why some families would see a tax increase, including Trump’s exchange of a new standard deduction for personal exemptions; his repeal of the head of household filing status, which benefits unmarried taxpayers with dependents; his exchange of a 10 percent bracket for a 12 percent bracket; and the reality that his new tax deduction and credit for child care would provide relatively little benefit to low- and middle-income caretakers. The Tax Foundation’s report didn’t address this issue, noting instead that as a rule, taxpayers in all income groups would see more money in their pocket if Trump’s plan was enacted. However, the Tax Foundation did find substantially bigger gains for wealthy Americans, which is consistent with Clinton’s statement that Trump’s plan would "disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy." It found that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would receive an income bump of between 0.8 percent and 1.9 percent, compared to 5.4 percent to 9.3 percent for the top 10 percent of taxpayers and between 10.2 percent and 16.0 percent for taxpayers in the top 1 percent. More to the point, the Tax Foundation’s Kyle Pomerleau tweeted favorably about Batchelder’s finding that some taxpayers would experience tax hikes, saying, "We were able to replicate many of the numbers in the report. The results seem reasonable to me." Another tax policy group, the Tax Policy Center, has not released an analysis of Trump’s most recent plan. The Trump campaign sent us a paper defending the tax proposal. However, it was not "independent" since it was written by a pair of "senior policy advisors to the Trump campaign." Our ruling Clinton said that, according to "independent experts," Trump's tax plan "would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy." Batchelder’s past work for Senate Democrats and the Obama White House may lead some to question whether she is an "independent expert." But her estimate of the debt increase was mirrored by findings by the more conservative Tax Foundation and the deficit-hawk Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the Tax Foundation said Batchelder’s analysis of tax increases for some families seemed "reasonable."

pomt-14252	On supporting winner of Democratic primary with her superdelegate vote.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/12/martha-laning/has-wisconsins-democratic-party-leader-flip-floppe/	The speeches, the balloons and the calls of "the great state of" (fill in the blank) -- all part of the pageantry of the 2016 Democratic and Republican national conventions -- won't fill the air until well after Independence Day. But already there are pitched battles among the presidential campaigns for delegates. Those are the folks who, in accordance with -- or perhaps in spite of -- the primaries and caucuses, will choose the party nominees. Ahead of the Democratic gathering in Philadelphia, Bernie Sanders is causing fireworks by trying to pry away superdelegates who have pledged to support Hillary Clinton. And Republican delegate leader Donald Trump has threatened to run as an independent if he is not treated fairly in Cleveland. All of which is to say there is significance attached to a delegate’s support -- particularly when the delegate, or in this case a superdelegate, is the head of a state party. On April 6, 2016, the day after Wisconsin's presidential primary, Wisconsin Associated Press reporter Scott Bauer tweeted that in 2015, state Democratic Party chairwoman Martha Laning told him she would give her superdelegate vote to the winner of the primary -- but that now she was telling him her vote would go instead to the presumptive nominee. So, has Laning flip flopped? That’s what our Flip-O-Meter is for -- to determine whether a political leader has been consistent on an issue. What she said In November 2015, in response to a question from the Associated Press, the Democratic Party sent a statement from Laning saying: "I will be supporting the candidate who wins the primary in Wisconsin next year. The Democratic voters in Wisconsin will evaluate each candidate and pick the strongest one and I will cast my vote for the candidate that they pick." As we noted, Sanders’ Wisconsin win was decisive -- he captured more than 56 percent of the vote, to Clinton’s 43 percent. At least one other Democratic superdelegate from Wisconsin has attributed the margin to the fact that Wisconsin holds an open primary, which allowed anyone -- voters who identify as Democrats or not -- to cast a ballot for the Vermont senator or the former secretary of state. Whether that influenced Laning isn't clear. But she did reverse her position, with her spokesman telling the AP after the primary she would back the presumptive nominee. She had also made such statements a few weeks earlier. At this stage, the presumptive nominee is Clinton, not Sanders. (As of April 10, 2016, Clinton is within 627 of the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination. Sanders is 1,315 short, leaving him little chance of winning the nomination with the remaining primaries and caucuses. The tally, from the Associated Press, includes superdelegates.) When we asked the state party about Laning’s apparent change, we received this statement from Laning: "As the party chair, I feel one of my main goals is to bring our party together to work together to defeat the Republicans. As our primary race has evolved and I have had the opportunity to talk to many voters across the state, I concluded it would be better for me to remain neutral and thereby be supportive of all our members’ individual choice. Once we have a nominee I will work with Democrats across the state to create unity and ensure that candidate becomes our next president." Our rating In November 2015, Laning said she would cast her superdelegate vote at the Democratic National Convention for the presidential candidate who wins the Wisconsin primary. But after the primary, which was won by Sanders, she reversed that position. She now says she will back whoever is the party’s presumptive nominee -- which at this stage is Clinton. We rate that a Full Flop. Editor's note: On April 12, 2016, after we published this item, the Wisconsin Democratic Party provided us examples of where Laning, before Wisconsin's primary election, said she had changed her position. For example, in one interview posted March 13, 2016, Laning said: "I will be putting my support behind the nominee." We have edited this item to reflect that timing.

pomt-09936	"In the first round of repayments" from financial institutions that received TARP money, "the government has actually turned a profit."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/10/barack-obama/obama-says-government-has-so-far-turned-profit-mon/	Admit it: When the federal government decided last fall to spend hundreds of billions to stabilize banks through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, you thought the money was as good as gone. Not so, President Barack Obama said at the White House on June 9, 2009. "Several financial institutions are set to pay back $68 billion to taxpayers," he said. "And while we know that we will not escape the worst financial crisis in decades without some losses to taxpayers, it's worth noting that in the first round of repayments from these companies the government has actually turned a profit." A quick summary of how we got to this point: As part of the TARP, the government invested about $200 billion in 600 banks across the country, essentially buying up preferred stock. A lot of banks now want out. The government money came with strings, including restrictions on executive compensation. Plus, there was a stigma attached to participating in the government program. On June 9, the Treasury Department announced that 10 of the largest financial institutions that participated in the Capital Purchase Program (through TARP) have been approved to repay $68 billion. Yes, they had to be approved to repay the money. The companies had to prove they no longer needed the money, because the government doesn't want them begging for more down the road. To date, those 10 companies have paid dividends on their preferred stock to the Treasury totaling about $1.8 billion, the Treasury announced. Overall, dividend payments from all of the 600 bank participants has come to about $4.5 billion so far. That's commensurate with the 5 percent (annualized) dividend return that was part of the terms of the program. Now, the government borrowed the money it invested in the banks, and so dividends from the preferred stock are offset by interest the government has had to pay on its loans. But that interest rate has been lower than the 5 percent dividend rate. So when the companies repay the loans, it will result in some profit to the government, banking analysts told us. There's another potential profit center. As part of the deal with banks, the federal government received warrants to buy stock at a future date (with the hope that as the economy improved and bank stock value rose, the government could share in the bounty). According to the Treasury announcement on June 9, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase those warrants at fair market value. Experts believe that could fetch the government several billion dollars. That's in addition to the dividends. David John, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while it's accurate to say the government is turning a profit on these specific transactions, it was so costly to create the TARP that "you can't say the overall program is a moneymaker." And, John said, the 10 financial institutions that will be repaying the Treasury are among the strongest. It remains to be seen how the others will fare, he said. "It's way too soon to judge the entire program," John said. "I'd be surprised if it ends up anything better than break-even." Still, the public too often tagged TARP as a bailout, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. "It's as if people thought money was handed out to banks," Hall said. "It wasn't. And it drove us nuts. The government has turned a profit. It made money plus some." Bank analyst Bert Ely said while the government may end up losing money on investments in some financial firms, it's likely the entirety of the bank portion of the TARP will ultimately turn a profit. The 5 percent paid in dividends on preferred stock purchased by the Treasury will certainly outpace the interest rate on money borrowed to finance the program, he said. And the warrants could also prove profitable. "People think the government gave banks money," Ely said. "They made investments in banks." As for Obama's claim, he is careful to note that the overall program could still cost taxpayers money, but he is correct to say the government turned a profit on the first round of repayments.

pomt-06832	On applying prosecutorial discretion to immigration cases.	full flop	/texas/statements/2011/aug/07/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-urged-immigration-authoritiesa-apply-d/	Two U.S. House members whose districts take in parts of Travis County are on opposite sides of a proposal to suspend the Obama administration’s ability to permit selected illegal immigrants to stay in the country. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, further says the measure offered by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, runs counter to Smith’s 1999 request that authorities apply discretionary authority to prevent the deportation of some immigrants. Doggett points out that Smith, in a 1999 letter to then-Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, then the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, called on the Clinton administration to let immigration authorities decide whether to enforce immigration laws in particular cases. Now, Doggett suggests, Smith is sounding a conflicting note. A Smith switcheroo? We turned on the Flip-O-Meter. In a statement, Smith told us he earlier referenced only cases against legal immigrants. At first, we thought this would be a simple comparison of Smith’s Nov. 4, 1999, letter, posted online by The Huffington Post, to the change in law he seeks. The 1999 letter expressed concern about how the government was removing "criminal aliens" from the country, stating there have been "cases of apparent extreme hardship." Its 28 House signers — including Texas Republicans Smith, Kay Granger and Sam Johnson and Texas Democrats Sheila Jackson Lee, Martin Frost, Eddie Berniece Johnson, Gene Green and Ciro Rodriguez — called for guidelines to ensure consistent application of "prosecutorial discretion." The letter didn’t say it was speaking only to legal immigrants, though it had a sentence singling some out: "Some cases may involve removal proceedings against legal permanent residents" who, the letter said, came to the country when young and "many years ago committed a single crime at the lower end of the ‘aggravated felony’ spectrum, but have been law-abiding ever since, obtained and held jobs and remained self-sufficient, and started families." It added: "Although they did not become United States citizens, immediate family members are citizens." At the time, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron told the San Antonio Express-News the agency was developing guidelines for such cases. The article said Congress had taken away immigration judges’ discretionary powers, though some powers were later restored. Some 5,500 of 55,600 immigrants with criminal records deported in fiscal 1999 were legal permanent residents, the newspaper said. The vast majority were illegal immigrants. Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told us in a telephone interview the government issued guidelines per prosecutorial discretion in 2000, her last year as the INS commissioner in the Bill Clinton administration. Those guidelines have since been refined, she said. Meissner said she sees a conflict between Smith’s 1999 letter and the legislation he and others unveiled last month that would bar the Obama administration from applying discretion in immigration cases. After rereading the 1999 letter, she said she never saw it as applying only to legal immigrants; its example of a legal immigrant is just a subset of all immigrants to whom prosecutorial discretion has long been applicable, she said. Smith’s recent characterization of the letter, she said, is "revisionist." Last month, Smith said his proposal, the Hinder the Administration’s Temptation Legalization (HALT) Act, would keep President Barack Obama from taking steps that Smith said amount to a "backdoor amnesty" for illegal immigrants. In a July 12 press release, Smith accused the administration of using executive branch authority to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country. "While this authority is justifiable when used responsibly, it’s clear this administration plans not to use but to abuse these powers," Smith said. The press release refers to memos issued by John Morton, director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, on how to exercise "prosecutorial discretion." One Morton memo, issued June 17, 2011, states the immigration agency has limited resources and "must prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space, and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system." It continues: "Because the agency is confronted with more administrative violations than its resources can address, the agency must regularly exercise ‘prosecutorial discretion’ if it is to prioritize its efforts. In basic terms, prosecutorial discretion is the authority of an agency charged with enforcing a law to decide to what degree to enforce the law against a particular individual." Listed are about 20 factors immigration officers may consider when deciding to detain individuals. Among them: how long the person has been in the country, with particular consideration given to their presence here legally; if the person came here as a young child; if they’ve pursued a college degree; if they’ve served or have immediate relatives who have served in the military; their ties to the community, including family relationships; and their age, with particular consideration for minors and the elderly. However, the memo says, certain negative factors also should be weighed, including whether individuals pose a clear risk to national security, are serious felons or known gang members, or have egregious records of immigration law violations. The memo includes a disclaimer stating that nothing in it should be "construed to prohibit the apprehension, detention, or removal of any alien unlawfully in the United States or to limit the legal authority of ICE or any of its personnel to enforce federal immigration law." A June 20 Houston Chronicle news article quotes a pro-immigration lawyer praising the memo, while Chris Crane, president of the union for ICE workers, the national ICE Council, is quoted saying the memo creates a law enforcement nightmare and an "out" for "everyone illegally in the United States." "We will never know who we can and can't arrest," Crane said. In the end, do Smith’s objections to the Obama administration’s approach conflict with his 1999 concerns? Sure. While the 1999 letter gives Smith a little fuel for concluding otherwise, it seems reasonable to us that if the House members writing that letter had wanted to limit their appeal to legal immigrants, they would have said so — at the very least saying that they opposed discretion for illegal immigrants. That did not happen. With the HALT proposal, Smith hopes to bar the government from using discretion. He's done a Full Flop.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2011-08-07T06:00:00	2011-07-12	['None']

Speaking favorably of the Bush stimulus plan, Romney said, "What's effective is, first, he's getting money back to consumers. And given the fact that two-thirds of our economy is a consumer economy, getting money back into the hands of our citizens, a lot of them paying a lot for gasoline, a lot for heating oil, a lot of people concerned about how to make ends meet, that makes sense to me." It made us wonder: Two-thirds of our economy geared to consumption? Is that true? Consumption includes pretty much everything we spend our money on. The major components of consumption include things like food, apparel and services, transportation, health care and entertainment. The latest data available from the third quarter of 2007 show that personal consumption expenditures in the United States made up 70 percent of the gross domestic product, with a split of 7.7 percent for durable goods, 20.4 percent for nondurable goods, and 41.9 percent for services.

pomt-04414	The Georgia Department of Economic Development assisted with the creation of 28,776 jobs, an increase of 29 percent from last fiscal year, and $5.97 billion in investments, a 32 percent increase.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/16/nathan-deal/gov-nathan-deal-touts-jobs-creation-investment/	Job creation has become the calling card of politicians on every level. From the president of the United States to the local city council member, all are touting their contributions to improving the economy through the most measurable way: jobs. Earlier this month, Gov. Nathan Deal released a statement touting job creation under his administration for the fiscal year that ended June 30. This was the first such announcement for Deal, who took office in January 2011. In the statement, Deal announced that jobs and investment generated by the Global Commerce Division of the Georgia Department of Economic Development jumped by almost one-third during fiscal 2012. "The department reported that the 403 company expansions or locations with which it assisted created 28,776 jobs, an increase of 29 percent from last fiscal year, and $5.97 billion in investment, a 32 percent increase," the statement said. We wanted to check the numbers. Where did they originate? At PolitiFact Georgia, we fact-check claims of others, but who at the state level fact-checks the companies’ job creation and investment claims? Is there any follow-up from state officials? Georgia’s unemployment rate sat at 9.2 percent in August, according to the state Labor Department, above the national rate of 7.8 percent in September. (Georgia’s unemployment numbers for September are expected later this week). Georgia lost 339,000 jobs during the Great Recession, according to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, and it has only regained about one-third of those jobs. During the most recent legislative session, Deal proposed a series of incentives -- some of which were approved by the Legislature -- designed to boost long- and short-term economic development. The plan included items such as removing the sales tax on energy used in manufacturing and broadening tax credits for adding jobs. With the jobs cited in the news release, we asked the Department of Economic Development about the numbers and how they are computed. The news release includes the number of jobs that companies say they are willing to commit to, said Alison Tyrer, a department spokeswoman. The companies also determine what amount of investment the project will produce, and the state also reports that information. Of the 403 projects worked by the state’s Global Commerce Division and mentioned in the release, 36 percent were new locations; the remaining 64 percent were expansions by existing companies. The release did not include information regarding the duration of the projects or how many of the jobs were new vs. existing or transfers from other areas. Nor does the release mention the incentives offered at the state and local levels to lure the companies to the state and promote expansion. In articles about some of the larger project announcements over the past fiscal year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported additional facts regarding the jobs and investment. For example, a new Caterpillar plant in Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties in northeast Georgia is listed as one of the top projects in the state in fiscal 2012. The company reported 1,400 jobs to be created and an investment in the state of $200 million. The factory was expected to initially employ 800 employees and expand to 1,400 jobs by 2020. The higher number is used in the news release, even though those jobs will come years from now. And a Home Depot company expansion in Cobb County for a customer support center was reported in the release as producing 700 jobs and a $24 million investment. In news reports at the time of the announcement in November 2011, company officials said the center would open with 400 jobs and expand to 700 jobs by 2015. Because they don’t independently track the numbers, the governor’s numbers can’t really be disputed, said Wesley Tharpe, a policy analyst for the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. The institute has done its own analysis based on all jobs, not just those affected by the Economic Development Department, and found that Georgia has seen a net increase of 50,000 jobs during the similar time period of Deal’s release, from July 2011 to July 2012. Without including the full information regarding incentives and job and investment results, releases such as those from Deal and other elected officials are "just fluff without any supporting evidence," said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy center promoting corporate and government accountability in economic development. Two years ago, Good Jobs First conducted a 50-state examination of state’s economic development transparency. At the time, Georgia was one of 13 states plus the District of Columbia to receive a zero rating because they did not report and evaluate the outcomes of economic development deals and spending. The organization plans to update the study next year. Within the Economic Development Department, the state does release information on incentives when required, Tyrer said. The department recommends grants for certain companies and projects that are then tracked by the Department of Community Affairs. Job tax credits are monitored by the Georgia Department of Revenue when companies report the jobs numbers on their annual tax forms. The jobs and investment claims in the news release include information about the total number of jobs created during fiscal 2012, which ended June 30. While the jobs gains are admirable, the numbers do not tell the full story. The numbers included are provided by the companies. They are not from independent analysis or state Economic Development Department examination. And many of the promised jobs and investments extend beyond the noted fiscal year -- they extend over the course of several years. That critical context is needed to move this item higher on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-10-16T06:00:00	2012-10-01	['None']

pomt-04819	Says Texas is 1st in business climate, 49th in education.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/17/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-texas-1st-business-climate-49t/	Still got your "Kinky for Governor: How Hard Could It Be?" t-shirt? Humorist, author and singer Kinky Friedman told the Dallas Morning News he’s considering another run. In an Aug. 1, 2012, commentary, Morning News political writer Wayne Slater quoted Friedman as saying that Gov. Rick "Perry has created a state that’s first in business climate and 49th in education. What’s wrong with that picture?" Friedman ran for governor as an independent in 2006 and for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat in 2010. This time, he told Slater, he’d go after Perry’s job as a Democrat and with a more serious approach. By email, we interviewed Friedman spokesman Cleve Hattersley, who worked on the 2006 gubernatorial campaign. Hattersley said Friedman was referring to a recent "business climate" ranking from CNBC and state education spending rankings from the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union. He sent us an NEA report plus a Huffington Post news story and an education professor’s blog analysis with more numbers, and noted, "Kinky has no campaign staff and no fact-checking apparatus, so he was speaking somewhat anecdotally … His numbers may have been a bit off." The rationale for evaluating Texas education based on spending, Hattersley said, is "that spending affects education on every level, and does so far into the future. Everything from teachers to textbooks is affected." We set out to check Friedman’s measures and give context with other rankings. We set aside the Perry part of the claim; PolitiFact has found many times that governors don’t merit sole credit or blame for the state of a state. As to business climate, the picture’s pretty clear. Texas is tops: CNBC, July 10, 2012: Texas was No. 1 in the "Top States for Business" rankings. "In our sixth annual study, Texas racked up an impressive 1,604 points out of a possible 2,500, with top-10 finishes in six of our 10 categories of competitiveness." The categories sweep in a wide range of factors, from business regulation and available workforce to cost of living and education. Site Selection magazine, November 2011: Texas was No. 1 in state business climate rankings. "By most measures, including Site Selection's own Governor's Cup and Business Climate Rankings, Texas is the place to be for business and industry." To compile its list, the magazine polls business executives and considers factors such as facilities built and business tax climate. Chief Executive magazine, May 2, 2012: Texas was No. 1 in the "Best States for Business." "In Chief Executive’s eighth annual survey of CEO opinion of Best and Worst States in which to do business, Texas easily clinched the No. 1 rank, the eighth successive time it has done so." On education, Hattersley pointed us to five tables in the NEA’s December 2011 report on education spending in 2008-09. The five rankings he cited are based on varied ways to calculate per-student spending from state, local and federal sources combined. Texas averages 41st on those five lists, Hattersley (correctly) noted. The Oct. 10, 2011, Huffington Post news story Hattersley sent us cited a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (which analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics). Looking at state budgets only, the report ranked Texas 3rd in percentage cuts of education spending and 7th in dollars cut. Flipping the rankings to make comparison easier, Texas would have been 47th and 43rd on lists ranking states by the smallest cuts in state funding. The blog post Hattersley cited is an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on the personal blog of Rutgers University Graduate School of Education professor Bruce Baker. Texas averaged 43rd on the post’s five bar charts analyzing 2007-08 state and local spending per student. We checked some other measures as well: The NEA report Hattersley cited puts Texas at 33rd in per-capita state government spending (rather than per student) on all education. Another list in the NEA report places Texas at 40th in per-capita state spending plus local spending for elementary and secondary education. Education Week magazine’s 2012 rankings, released in January, placed Texas 40th in its "school finance" category, which wraps in many factors regarding state and local spending. A nonpartisan public policy center called the New America Foundation analyzes government data in its Federal Education Budget Project. Based on 2008-09 school year numbers, the project ranked Texas 41st in per-student spending of local, federal and state money. Because Friedman’s claim referred to "education" rather than specifying "education spending," we looked up a few student performance measures as well. Texas placed between 12th and 39th on these lists and was near national SAT averages: The U.S. Department of Education’s 2011 results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, as analyzed by the New America project, place Texas 28th in fourth-grade math, 37th in fourth-grade reading, 12th in eighth-grade math and 39th in eighth-grade reading. Education Week’s publisher, Editorial Projects in Education, ranked Texas 17th in both 2011 and 2012 on its "K-12 Achievement" index, which it bases on performance, improvement and equity in results between students who qualify economically for free school lunches and those who don’t. The College Board discourages ranking states by SAT scores, but 2011 results showed Texas students scored below national arithmetic averages in reading and writing and above the national average in math. Mean scores in Texas (with 58 percent participation, the 13th highest rate) were 475 in reading, 500 math, 461 writing. Nationwide mean scores: 500 reading, 495 math, 497 writing. We also looked at "adequate yearly progress," a measure that’s been in the news recently as data for the 2011-12 school year emerges. States are required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act to assess such progress, but each state sets its own standards and benchmarks. An Aug. 8, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas Education Agency reported 44.2 percent of schools met the state’s "adequate yearly progress" standards. How does that compare with other states? We found 2011 state-by-state percentages calculated by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center on Education Policy, though deputy director Diane Stark Rentner warned us not to use them for a "ranking," noting again that each state sets its own standards. Recklessly we plunged ahead, using the center’s collection of data for 2011 (when TEA reported 66 percent of Texas schools hit the mark) to generate our own statistically silly list, on which Texas placed 11th. But again: This compares oranges to apples. Hattersley acknowledged that the backup he provided doesn’t substantiate Friedman’s claim on Texas education. But according to the Morning News interview, we can expect better-researched positions if The Other Man in Black launches a fresh gubernatorial bid. Would a more serious campaign mean no more "He Ain’t Kinky, He’s My Governor" stickers? "The discussions to which I have been privy are quite serious," Hattersley told us, "but good slogans have always been players in political campaigns." Our ruling Friedman nailed the state’s No. 1 business ranking. But his claim that Texas is 49th in education lacks supporting evidence. That said, Texas usually lands in the bottom half of the states, according to education spending and student achievement measures. We rate Friedman’s claim Half True.

pomt-09364	"Farouk is on fire."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/01/j-xavier/rapper-j-xavier-says-farouk-shami-fire/	Stop, drop and roll? Houston businessman and first-time candidate Farouk Shami wasn't successful in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but we're still, um, singing his praises for a song his campaign debuted the night before the primary election. From a March 1 press release issued by his campaign: "In a last-minute push to win supporters and motivate Texans to go to the polls tomorrow, Farouk Shami has publicly released the song 'Farouk' ..." Playing on the well-worn lyric "the roof is on fire," 17-year-old Houston hip-hop artist J. Xavier penned a catchy refrain that stuck: "Farouk, Farouk, Farouk is on fire, serving da community his number one desire." We wonder: Was Shami ever on fire? First, let's review the lyrics the campaign sent in March. Who got da new solutions for Texas... Farouk! / when it comes to da state who's gon rep it... Farouk! / now say it Farouk Farouk Farouk is on fire / serving da community his number one desire... Came to America 44 years ago / 71 dollars to his name now dat's pocket change / kinda like President Obama a few years ago, in his mind frame it's time to change / creating Texas jobs & reforming health care / he cares if nobody else cares, elsewhere / providing quality education / preserving our environment / Farouk is on fire please call da fireman / his drive is inspiring / lives he inspire them... Xavier, a Houston native, wrote "Tell Your Mama to Vote for Obama" during the 2008 presidential campaign, but that song made no reference to pyrotechnics. However, chants of "fired up, ready to go" were often heard during Obama's campaign rallies. Shami falls in line with a other office-seekers who have dabbled with fire. The late Reagan Brown, who once served as state agriculture commissioner, infamously stuck his hand in a fire-ant mound as a campaign stunt in 1982, only to have the fiery pests swarm up and bite his arm. What about Shami's personal relationship with fire? On Nov. 19, the Houston Chronicle reported that Shami had come "under fire" when a conservative commentator claimed his support for Palestinian rights put him opposition to Israel. The Chronicle later pointed out that Shami could fire his employees, some of whom quit rather than be fired. We couldn't reach Shami to gauge if he was ever truly "on fire." But seeing as we've previously rated a Shami statement as Pants on Fire, he definitely was en fuego here. So, we must rate J. Xavier's statement as True. And we wish you a happy April Fools' Day.

pomt-09597	"The No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/20/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-americans-rate-getting-back-w/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, heartily welcomed Republican Scott Brown’s upset win Tuesday of a Senate seat in Massachusetts — a victory that’ll soon give the GOP the 41 Senate seats needed to filibuster legislation to foil the Democratic majority. Cornyn, who doubles as chairman of a political committee devoted to electing GOP senators, was asked by the Fox News Channel on Wednesday what Republicans should do with the message sent by Massachusetts voters. Cornyn initially mentioned public concern about Democrats’ closed-door rewrites of a health care overhaul. But, Cornyn continued, this "is a matter also of misplaced priorities and the No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work." We wondered if Cornyn correctly pegged Americans' priority issue. Indeed, a recent national poll places the economy at the top of voter concerns. In the poll taken Jan. 12-15 for The Washington Post and ABC News, 42 percent of respondents identified the economy as the most important problem they’d like to see President Obama and Congress address this year. Among those economy-focused respondents, 26 percent singled out jobs/employment as a priority. The second-highest-rated issue was health care, named as the first concern of 24 percent. Similarly, a poll taken Jan. 10-14 by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News found jobs topping Americans’ concerns. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said job creation and economic growth was the top priority. Thirteen percent chose national security/terrorism and 13 percent said the deficit and government spending. So the senator got it right. Americans consider jobs the No. 1 issue right now.

pomt-14346	"When those restrictions expire (in the Iran nuclear deal), Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-iran-military-will-have-nuclear/	Donald Trump tried to demonstrate his proficiency in foreign policy March 21 during a speech at the 2016 American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in Washington. One focus of his talk involved condemning the Iran nuclear deal, saying it was a pact that gives "the world’s leading state sponsor of terror" $150 billion while the United States gets "absolutely nothing in return." "I’ve studied this issue in great detail — I would say actually greater by far than anybody else," Trump said. When the audience voiced skepticism he said, "Believe me. Oh, believe me." "The deal doesn’t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability," he said. "Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, especially Israel." Iran had not built a nuclear weapon at the time the deal was struck, so we wondered if Trump was correct in saying, "when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go." We emailed the Trump campaign looking for details, but didn't hear back. So we contacted other people who have also looked at the deal. It is correct that after 15 years, the limitations that prohibit Iran from enriching enough uranium to create a bomb will expire. We'll get into that in a moment. But to say that, at the 15-year mark, Iran will have a ready-to-go military nuclear capacity ignores the reality of creating that capability and "simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association, which supports the deal. Various parts of the agreement expire at different times, as the following chart from the association shows. Yet some portions don't expire at all, such as the provision prohibiting Iran from conducting activities which could contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive. As long as it follows that part of the pact, it will never have nuclear weapons. But critics are focusing on elements of the deal that do expire. For example, the limit on the number of high-tech centrifuges needed to concentrate enough uranium to make a bomb goes away in 10 years. The requirements that uranium-235 be at a concentration no greater than 3.67 percent and that Iran have no more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium expire after 15 years. The concern is that, at that point, Iran would restart its nuclear weapons program. However, there would be nothing "ready to go" about their bomb or the delivery system needed to use it. At the time of the deal, the worst-case scenario was that Iran was two or three months from developing any type of nuclear bomb. Installing more and more sophisticated centrifuges "would take at least several months," according to Matthew Kroenig of Georgetown University and a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign. He said it's true that once the enrichment limit is gone, that could set the stage for a nuclear weapon. "It is hard to know how long this would take because Iran never came clean on its past weaponization work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make covertly over the next 15 years. But again, several months is a reasonable assumption," he said. "Next, it would need to marry the warhead to its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in mounting conventional warheads on its already sizable ballistic missile stockpile, this should be a relatively routine matter, said Kroenig. "So, in sum, after the limits expire, it would likely still take Iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon. But, the expansion of the enrichment program to ‘industrial size’ would be allowed at that point." "To build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it would take several years," Kroenig said. "Iran will not have an industrial-sized nuclear capability, military or otherwise, when the deal ends at 10 to 15 years," said Richard Nephew of Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. The country had about 18,000 IR-1 centrifuges, most of which are dismantled and stored as part of the deal. As existing machines wear out, the stored ones can be brought out of mothballs to replace them. Iran would need about 50,000 to make fuel just for its nuclear power plant. "They won't go from 18,000 stored/operating centrifuges at year 10 to 15 to 50,000 over a weekend," he said. Kroenig said that if the intent is there, "Iran can build as large and sophisticated an enrichment program as it would like, consistent with the terms of the deal. At that point there is very little other states could do to stop it from building nuclear weapons if it decides to do so." But other experts we consulted said that's unlikely for a host of reasons. "U.S. intelligence concluded in 2007 that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003-04," and there is no indication the program was restarted, Nephew said. Then there are the permanent inspection requirements. "While Iran will be allowed to gradually expand its peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program after year 10, it must remain exactly that — a peaceful, civilian, non-military nuclear program," State Department spokesman Sem Werberg said in an email. "If at any point in time — before 10 years, after 10 years, or at any point in the future — there is any evidence that Iran is 'militarizing' its nuclear program in any way, then it would be in violation of the deal AND its international commitments." However, what the world would or could do about it at that point is a matter for debate. "Assuming that the Iranians are not cheating, then they couldn't have a 'military nuclear capability' ready to go ever," Nephew contended. "In fact, provisions of the deal would preclude such a capability forever." If Iran does decide to change course, supporters of the deal suspect that inspection and surveillance provisions of the deal will give other countries plenty of warning. "We will continue to have exquisite knowledge of how much uranium they have for 25 years because inspection of their mines and mills, will continue for 25 years. We will also know for 20 years how many centrifuge machines they will be producing where," said Kimball. "To say there will be a military nuclear capability ready to go simply ignores the other limitations and monitoring provisions that will extend well beyond the 15-year mark of the agreement." "If Mr. Trump had studied the deal more than anyone else," Kimball continued, "these facts would be apparent to him." Our ruling Trump said, "When those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-size military nuclear capability ready to go." Key restrictions in the deal never expire, including the pledge to not conduct activities that would contribute to the design and development of a nuclear explosive. And even if Iran were to go all-out for a nuclear program once the 15-year limit on uranium enrichment goes away, it would take months, if not years, for the country to develop a bomb and delivery system so its military could go to war with nuclear weaponry. We rate the claim as False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-24T10:38:24	2016-03-21	['Iran']

pomt-01798	"There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state (health insurance) exchange."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/24/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-gop-governors-blocke/	Two recent federal court cases, both about federal subsidies for health insurance, came within hours of each other this week, putting the future of the Affordable Care Act into question. In Halbig vs. Burwell, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a 2-1 ruling that said people in states that don't operate their own marketplaces can't get subsidies. But a few hours later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in King vs. Burwell. Their unanimous decision upheld the legality of the subsidies for all states, even those without their own insurance marketplaces. That same day Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair and congresswoman from Florida, appeared on the Nevada news program Ralston Reports. "There was a lot of panic from supporters of the law after the Halbig decision came down from the panel at the D.C. court," said host Jon Ralston. But Wasserman Schultz said she thought it would be resolved in favor of maintaining the subsides for all states. "I think ultimately, when the Supreme Court decides this, it’s going to be very clear that the unanimous ruling by the Fourth Circuit is the right one." She also said Nevada had "a governor who refused to implement a state exchange." She quickly had to backtrack as Ralston reminded her of Gov. Brian Sandoval’s enthusiastic support of a state exchange. "Well, I stand corrected, I’m not from Nevada," Wasserman Schultz acknowledged. But she went on to make another claim we found questionable. "There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange, and as a result people who get Affordable Care Act plans are getting them through the federal exchange," Wasserman Schultz said. It turns out that Wasserman Schultz was off on this claim, too. Numbers don’t lie Using information compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, we looked at each state’s marketplace profile. We found a total of 36 states that currently use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships and would be affected by Halbig vs. Burwell. We sorted them into four categories. States with Republican governors that adopted the federal exchange: 27 States with Democratic governors that adopted the federal exchange: 2 States with Republican governors that adopted a state-federal partnership: 2 States with Democratic governors that adopted state-federal partnership: 5 So of the 36 states that use the federal exchange or a partnership program, only 29 actually had Republican governors when the decisions were made about establishing health care marketplaces. In 27 of those states, Republican governors opted to use the federally established marketplace, Heathcare.gov, instead of a state-run program. This number includes New Mexico and Idaho, whose Republican governors originally aimed to establish state-based marketplaces in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Both states ended up choosing a federally-facilitated marketplace but hope to open their own state-based marketplaces in 2014. It also includes Utah, a state that had an insurance marketplace established before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010. In Utah, the federal government runs the market for individual insurance, but the state controls the insurance exchange for small businesses. There are two Republican-led states, Iowa and Michigan, that supported independent state marketplaces, but ended up establishing state-federal partnerships instead. State-federal partnerships allow the states to play a role in the insurance marketplace, without assuming full responsibility. In 2012, Iowa Republican Gov. Terry Branstad announced that the state would operate on a state-federal partnership for the time being. Branstad said they plan to transition to a state insurance marketplace by 2016. And in Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder supported the creation of a state-based marketplace, but opted for the partnership in 2012. Republican governors were not alone in their decision to use the federal exchange or set up state-federal partnerships. Seven states with Democratic governors did it, too. Of the seven states, two use the federal exchange, while five operate partnership marketplaces. For example, in Missouri, Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon attempted to set up a state marketplace in 2012, but voters blocked his attempts. Ultimately, Nixon was forced to back away from a state marketplace. In Montana, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer opted for the federally run insurance marketplace. The other five Democratic states that operate a state-federal partnership are New Hampshire, Delaware, West Virginia, Illinois and Arkansas. In New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan established the partnership marketplace in February of 2013. Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn laid out a plan similar to that used in Iowa. The state is currently using a partnership exchange, but plans to establish a state marketplace by 2015. DNC spokesman Michael Czin said that Wasserman Schultz meant to say there were "26 Republican governors who used the federal exchange this year instead of setting up their own state-based exchange." Czin was counting the number of states now that have Republican governors. We think it’s more accurate to counts states that had Republican governors when the exchanges were set up, and that number would be 27 (not counting the two GOP governors that set up partnership exchanges). Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that there were "36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state exchange." There are 36 states that use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships instead of state-based marketplaces. But seven of those states are run by Democrats. And, some of the states with Republican governors, like New Mexico and Idaho, tried to institute a state exchange before opting for federally-facilitated marketplace. So while most of the 36 states had Republican governors, not all of them did. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-03282	"In fact New Jersey is a donor state, we get 61 cents back on every dollar we send to Washington. And interestingly Kentucky gets $1.51 on every dollar they send to Washington."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/aug/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-kentucky-gets-more-twice-bac/	The past week’s political sandbox match between Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul kicked up a lot of dust. But after a week of increasingly insulting barbs between the two possible Republican presidential contenders for 2016, fueled by a disagreement about national security matters, there’s one claim that caught the Truth-O-Meter’s attention – and it’s not whether Christie is the "King of Bacon" when it comes to government spending, as Paul claimed July 30 during an interview on CNN. "In fact New Jersey is a donor state, we get 61 cents back on every dollar we send to Washington," Christie said July 30 in response to Rand’s claim that New Jersey has a ‘gimme, gimme, gimme’ attitude about federal spending. "And interestingly Kentucky gets $1.51 on every dollar they send to Washington." Kentucky receives more than double what New Jersey gets in federal funding? For this claim, Christie’s got the numbers on his side. We reviewed data from the business-backed Tax Foundation, which tracked from 1981 through 2005 how much each state gets back in expenditures for every dollar sent in taxes to the federal government. Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said the group is working to update the data. The Washington, D.C.-based foundation calculated the federal tax burden -- a measurement meant to account for taxes that are assessed in one state, but impact taxpayers elsewhere -- to conduct its analysis. Christie’s figures come from data for 2005, which shows that New Jersey received 61 cents and Kentucky received $1.51 for every dollar each state sent to Washington. Paul didn’t challenge Christie’s numbers but noted that two military bases in Kentucky (Fort Campbell and Fort Knox) might be one reason why Kentucky gets the rate of federal funding it does. Two bases? Perhaps the senator didn’t know that New Jersey has five active military bases: the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst; the Army’s Picatinny Arsenal; the Coast Guard’s Loran Support Unit in Wildwood and the Training Center in Cape May; and Naval Weapons Station Earle. Let’s look beyond Christie’s claim and review the Tax Foundation’s 25 years’ worth of data in more depth. For example, as New Jersey’s rate of return on dollars sent to Washington decreased from a high of about 72 cents in 1981, Kentucky’s increased, from $1.06 that year to $1.51 in 2005. Further, in 17 of the 25 years analyzed, New Jersey came in last place, receiving 70 cents or less for every dollar it sent to the federal government. Kentucky, however, has climbed from about 23rd place among all states to 9th place. But since Christie’s data is about eight years old, we also checked with other organizations that track these types of numbers. The Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes 18 states in the region, released a May 2011 report on federal spending and taxation patterns that focused on New Jersey. New Jersey ranked 48th nationwide, according to the report. Only Minnesota and Delaware received smaller returns on their federal tax dollars in 2009. Colleen Cain, a senior policy analyst with the Northeast-Midwest Institute who prepared the 2011 report, said in the report that New Jersey’s low ranking is due to the state’s "relatively high income levels and greater-than-average business income tax contribution, coupled with a relatively low need for federal aid. It does, however, underscore the importance of states like New Jersey in supporting the fiscal health of the nation generally." Cain did not respond to a request for additional comment. Our ruling Christie said, "In fact New Jersey is a donor state, we get 61 cents back on every dollar we send to Washington," in response to Rand’s claim that New Jersey has a ‘gimme’ attitude about federal spending. "And interestingly Kentucky gets $1.51 on every dollar they send to Washington." Christie’s claim is right on the money: even though the most recent data available is eight years old, the Tax Foundation backs up the governor’s statement to the exact penny for both New Jersey and Kentucky. So when it comes to a game of fiscal "gimme, gimme, gimme," it might behoove the senator to check his own state’s coffers first before attacking New Jersey. Christie’s statement rates True.

pomt-07974	The impact of the 2010 federal health care legislation will be "huge" on Georgia.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/21/nathan-deal/deal-healthcare-prediction-needs-more-details/	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like many conservatives, is sickened by the federal health care legislation that passed last year. "When you start talking about the financial obligation this bill will place on this state and every state, it's huge," Deal said in a December interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Deal said earlier this week to the Georgia Healthcare Association that the bill will cost the state government an additional $250 million a year in Medicaid costs, beginning in 2014. We're well aware of the ongoing debate about whether the bill is a good piece of legislation. Most Democrats and progressives praise the legislation, saying it expands health care to more Americans. They also note that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the health care legislation will reduce the deficit by $124 billion over 10 years. Most Republicans and conservatives argue the bill is a classic example of government overreach, dispute the deficit estimates and say it will hurt small businesses. We're not here to argue the merits of the bill. Our curiosity was piqued by Deal's claim about the legislation's impact on the Peach State. Will it, as Deal said, have a "huge" impact on Georgia? Or is he scaring us? "When you expand eligibility for a program, you enlarge costs," said Stephanie Mayfield, a spokeswoman for the governor. "Under new regulations, a family of four earning $30,000 a year can join the Medicaid rolls. You multiply how many new recipients will come on the state rolls by the amount the average recipient costs the state and you're talking about a huge cost. There's no debate on this issue." So how much will this cost Georgia taxpayers? There will be many health cost reductions and cost increases as a result of the bill. Many of those will be determined by regulations yet to be written. But one of the biggest costs will be for Medicaid, the health program for low-income Americans. And those costs have already been widely calculated. In 2014, anyone with an income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, currently about $30,000, will be Medicaid eligible. There were about 1.4 million Georgians on Medicaid in 2010, according to the state Department of Community Health. One widely used estimate, by the Urban Institute for the Henry F. Kaiser Family Foundation, suggests an additional 774,000 Georgians will be eligible under the new plan. Deal estimates an additional 650,000 Georgians would be eligible. The Kaiser Foundation estimates Georgia will spend an additional $714 million to $1.2 billion on Medicaid between 2014 and 2019 as a result of the legislation. The conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation estimates the Peach State will spend $1.3 billion during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2020. The Heritage Foundation based its estimate on data from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The annual average of both projections is about $200 million a year. The state Department of Community Health's budget says its budget for Medicaid and Peachcare, the state's program for uninsured children, is about $1.4 billion. An additional $200 million in spending would result in about a 14 percent increase. Karen Minyard, executive director of the Georgia Health Policy Center, said including Medicaid, there are about 10 changes involving the federal legislation that may have an impact on state finances. They include the health insurance exchange, where people can buy insurance policies that meet minimum standards for coverage. An estimated 1.7 million Georgians who do not have health insurance and 387,000 residents with nongroup insurance will be able to buy coverage through the health insurance exchange, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Minyard also said the state may have to spend more money to cover its own employees, hire people to implement the program, provide additional immunization and oral care, and cover other costs. Minyard, whose center is based in Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said many of the costs will not be known until additional details are worked out by state and federal lawmakers. "When I think of the magnitude of this change, it is going to be a very big change," she said. "There is no way to get around it." The state's Department of Community Health estimated the additional cost in 2013 could be anywhere from $100 million to $200 million, according to one state report. It could rise to $500 million a year between 2014 and 2019, according to a September 2010 report put together by the Georgia Senate's research office. Most of the cost to care for new Medicaid recipients will come from the federal government, experts say. The state's costs do not accurately reflect the state's costs under the final version of the bill, the Senate report said. Georgia's current fiscal year budget is about $18 billion. The highest annual projections of the impact of the health care legislation, $500 million, would be approximately a 2.8 percent increase to the state budget. Deal's projected increase in Medicaid costs amounts to an average of $250 million a year, which is a 1.4 percent budget increase. The governor's number does not include other projected costs. The percentages may seem small, but considering the state's grim financial state, an additional $500 million to the budget would be significant. However, those projections are not as solid as the studies by Kaiser and the Heritage Foundation. Considering that the precise impact of the legislation on Georgia is yet to be determined, we think it's somewhat early for Deal to say exactly how big the impact will be on state finances. But every indication is that it will be significant. The governor's statement is largely correct but needs clarification. Still, in a financially struggling state where the budget, by law, must be balanced and where Medicaid consumes a significant portion of that budget, the governor makes a valid point. We rate Deal's claim as Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2011-01-21T06:00:00	2010-12-08	['None']
pomt-09748	Under the Hate Crimes bill, "any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/09/john-kline/rep-john-kline-and-other-republicans-say-under-hat/	A number of Republican congressmen cried foul this week when Democrats attached a controversial hate crime bill to a must-pass $680 billion national defense policy bill. The House passed the defense bill 281-146, with most of the opposition votes coming from Republicans. They said they objected to inclusion of a hate crime provision that they say will put federal prosecutors in the "thought crime" business. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act would prohibit "violent acts motivated by actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of a victim." Already, some 45 states have hate crime statutes, so in practice the federal law would mostly serve to provide technical and financial support to local law enforcers so they can more aggressively prosecute violent hate crimes; but it also would allow federal prosecutors to pursue violent hate crime cases that state or local officials are unable or unwilling to prosecute. U.S. Rep. John Kline, a former Marine whose son serves in the military, voted for the defense bill in June before it included the expanded hate crimes provision. But in voting against the bill this week, Kline echoed a concern voiced by several Republican leaders that the hate crime bill could lead to prosecution of religious leaders preaching their morality about sexual preference from the pulpit. "I disdain racism, sexism, and bigotry, but under this legislation, any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime," the Minnesota Republican stated in an Oct. 8, 2009, press release. This isn't a new charge about the hate crimes bill. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama was criticized for his support of the hate crimes legislation by an evangelical group that claimed the bill would "put churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality." We rated that claim False . Proponents of the hate crimes law argue that such a hypothetical is absurd, that the law clearly targets violent acts, and that religious leaders are still protected by First Amendment free speech laws. But just to be extra clear, Democrats on a conference committee recently added specific protections against just the kinds of concerns raised by Kline. Here's how the bill reads now: "Nothing in this division ... shall be construed or applied in a manner that infringes any rights under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Nor shall anything in this division ... be construed or applied in a manner that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion (regardless of whether compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), speech, expression, or association" unless prosecutors can demonstrate that the speech was intended to "plan or prepare for an act of physical violence" or "incite an imminent act of physical violence against another." It's that last part that concerns some Republican leaders like Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana. "As has been previously stated by Judge Carter of Texas, under Section 2 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code today, an individual may be held criminally liable who 'aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures' in the commission of a federal crime," Pence said from the House floor on Oct. 8. "Therefore, to put a fine point on it, any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi, or imam, who may give a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices, could presumably under this legislation be found to have aided, abetted or induced in the commission of a federal crime. This will have a chilling effect on religious expression, from the pulpits, in our temples, in our mosques and in our churches. And it must be undone." But we quote more from the bill: "Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit any constitutionally protected speech, expressive conduct or activities (regardless of whether compelled by, central to, a system of religious belief), including the exercise of religion protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and peaceful picketing or demonstration." Again, the bill notes, "The Constitution of the United States does not protect speech, conduct or activities consisting of planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of violence." In other words, you can preach that the Bible says homosexuality is wrong, but you can't encourage violence against gay people. Brian Moulton, chief legislative counsel for the Human Rights Coalition, said this language makes "exceedingly clear" that the kind of thing talked about by Kline, Pence and others is "just not possible under this legislation." "I don't see how anyone who has read the language of the legislation could come to that conclusion," Moulton said. We certainly think it's fair for Republicans to criticize the decision to add this controversial hate crime provision to a bill that funds the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we also think it's wrong for opponents of the bill to again raise the scare tactic that it might lead to the prosecution of preachers who condemn homosexuality from the pulpit. The language of the bill makes abundantly clear that it would not. And we rule Kline's statement False.	None	John Kline	None	None	None	2009-10-09T15:22:37	2009-10-08	['None']

pomt-02626	"Most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/21/bob-kincaid/west-virginia-activist-says-outsiders-own-90-state/	A January chemical spill in West Virginia that left 300,000 without tap water was just the most recent episode of contamination in a state that has suffered more than its share. Bob Kincaid, a liberal radio host and co-founder of Appalachian Community Health Emergency, said in West Virginia "everything has been for sale to the highest bidder," with the toll taken out on the health of the people who live there. "We have sacrificed everything in order to enhance those corporate profits for people who are outside this state," Kincaid said on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. "Let's understand that most of West Virginia is still owned, in excess of 90 percent, by out-of-state interests." That number jumped out at us and when we got in touch with Kincaid, he was quick to say he had made a mistake. "The number is lower," he said. But whatever the number, Kincaid said it wasn’t central to his point. "The germane fact remains that 300,000 human beings are involuntarily participating in an unconscionable experiment on them, and that is a terrifying reality." West Virginia has been rich in coal and timber and the trade-off of who benefits the most from mining and logging is a topic that has simmered for many decades in the state. A landmark 1974 study by a local investigative journalist found that absentee landlords owned or controlled two-thirds of the state’s private land. (That’s obviously well short of 90 percent.) In 2013, a follow-up report from the West Virginia Center for Budget and Policy, a group that focuses on the needs of the moderate and low-income people, and the American Friends Service Committee, found that the fraction of land concentrated in the hands of relatively few owners is much less today. The 10 largest landowners are all headquartered out of state and they hold title to about 12 percent of the state’s private acreage. Laying claim to what’s on the surface misses a big piece of West Virginia’s wealth picture. A huge sum of money lies in the mineral rights, mainly the coal and gas. Owning the land doesn’t necessarily mean you own what’s underneath it. But Ted Boettner, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, is reluctant to make hard and fast claims as to who owns that part of the state. "All you can say is that a large fraction of the mineral rights are held by out-of-state interests, but beyond that, we just don’t have the data," Boettner said. Our ruling Kincaid said during the broadcast that more than 90 percent of West Virginia is owned by out-of-state interests. He told us he realized his mistake after the show and apologized for his error. Kincaid gets credit for his readiness to correct his original statement, but we fact-check what he said on air. His claim was wrong. We rate it False.	None	Bob Kincaid	None	None	None	2014-01-21T11:59:34	2014-01-19	['None']
pomt-08253	Oregon’s budget has grown by 49 percent in just four years.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/12/allen-alley/allen-alley-says-oregons-budget-has-increased-near/	Just days after the 2010 election -- and before some races had even been called -- Allen Alley, an Oregon politico who most recently sought the Republican nomination for governor, assailed the state’s runaway spending. In a post on his website, Alley examined government spending data and concluded that "the State of Oregon Biennial Budget has grown from $41 billion in 2005-07 to $61 billion in 2009-11 - a more than 49% increase in just 4 years." That’s a pretty hefty margin in a short amount of time, so PoltiFact Oregon decided to investigate. We double-checked Alley’s numbers with the state’s Budget and Management Division, a nonpartisan governmental office. According to Brian DeForest, the deputy administrator of the division, Alley’s numbers were right on. For the 2005-2007 biennium, Oregon’s total funds budget was about $40.8 billion. For 2009-2011, the number is projected to be somewhere around $61.3 billion. When you use those two numbers to calculate the percent increase, you find Alley actually underestimated. The total funds budget increased by about 50.2 percent over those four years. But, as with most budget-related issues, there’s more than one way to look at these numbers. That big $61.3 billion number is the total state spending -- it includes federal money and a large number of user-related fees that include everything from gas taxes to physician license fees to college tuition. This number, depending on what you’re analyzing, can be a bit misleading for three reasons: 1) The user fees don’t represent a tax burden for all Oregonians; you only pay the gas tax if you drive and you only pay tuition if you’re taking courses. 2) Many of the federal funds included in this sum can’t be avoided. The federal government sets enrollment requirements and the state must comply. 3) Changes in how benefits are allocated can inflate the numbers. This recently was the case when benefits for educators across the state were centralized, whereas previously they had been doled out at the local level. No new money was spent, but it shows up as an added state expenditure. So, while that figure does say something about the state’s spending, the conversation usually revolves around a smaller piece of that pie called the general fund -- the portion of the state’s budget that is funded primarily through state income tax. That, DeForest says, "is where we typically have the majority of our conversations." A look at this piece of the budget reveals a pretty different picture. During the 2005-2007 budget period, the general fund budget was about $11.6 billion. This budget cycle (2009-2011) the general funds budget was projected to reach $13.4 billion, but that number is in the process of being revised down as state income falls. That reduction will be just shy of $1 billion says DeForest, for a general fund of somewhere near $12.5 billion. With those numbers, the percent increase is a scant 7.75 percent when compared to the 49 percent Alley had originally cited. It’s also worth pointing out that, no matter their desire, Oregon politicians, by law, can’t craft a budget that spends more than the state takes in. So, talk about overspending in Oregon is somewhat different from the conversation at the national level where we’ve become accustomed to running a deficit and building up a large national debt. Anyhow, you all are probably wondering, which number is right: Alley’s 49 percent or our 7.75 percent. Both are accurate from a factual point of view. The number a given politician uses typically depends on which number will help better make his or her point. We think Alley should have offered up more context -- it’s the web; he has the room. But that said, Alley did dig up accurate numbers. And his math stands up. So we rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-07737	"A miscarriage is considered an abortion."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/01/eddie-lucio-jr/state-sen-eddie-lucio-said-miscarriage-considered-/	State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., among supporters of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a sonogram, made a dramatic statement in the floor debate before senators advanced the measure to the House. "There are literally millions of abortions going on each year in our own state," the Brownsville Democrat said Feb. 17, adding that he would "like to see the definition of abortion really be looked at. A miscarriage is considered an abortion, and I don’t think it should be considered an abortion because that’s a natural thing that unfortunately happens." After we sought more information from Lucio’s office, Lucio spoke again in the debate, saying: "A while ago I was speaking with numbers, I misspoke with my numbers." For other articles, we’ve confirmed that there have been about 50 million abortions nationally since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling and that 80,000 abortions took place Texas in 2008. As we started to check Lucio’s other floor statement — that a miscarriage is considered an abortion — Lucio told us in an e-mail statement that friends who lost a baby and underwent a procedure to remove the fetus from the womb told him their insurance company considered the procedure an abortion. He said he didn’t intend to suggest that a miscarriage in itself should be considered an abortion. "I have strong beliefs about life," Lucio said. "In an effort to articulate my beliefs... I misspoke." We sought independent guidance on whether a miscarriage is considered an abortion. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us miscarriages are sometimes referred to as "spontaneous abortions," though she said that the agency doesn’t include them in its annual abortion counts. No law requires the agency to track miscarriages, Williams said. "Unfortunately miscarriages are very common and often happen before a woman even knows she’s pregnant making complete and accurate data collection very difficult," she said. She cited the legal definition of abortion in Texas. According to the Texas Health and Safety Code, an abortion is "an act or procedure performed after pregnancy has been medically verified and with the intent to cause the termination of a pregnancy other than for the purpose of either the birth of a live fetus or removing a dead fetus." According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 66 percent of 6.4 million pregnancies in 2008 resulted in live births and 19 percent ended in abortions. In Texas, 70 percent of 579,700 pregnancies were live births and 15 percent ended in abortions. An estimated 15 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriages, according to the institute. Rebecca Wind, an institute spokeswoman, told us that while "spontaneous abortion" is the medical term for an abortion, miscarriages aren’t included in abortion statistics and there is no national effort to track miscarriages. "In many cases, women who have miscarriages may not know they have had them," Wind said, because one can happen early in a pregnancy. Next, we contacted the Texas Medical Association, which represents 45,000 physicians and medical students. Spokeswoman Pam Udall confirmed that doctors usually call a miscarriage a spontaneous abortion because "the body itself is aborting the pregnancy," she said. "It is a natural consequence that affects up to one in four pregnancies." Udall pointed us to a 2002 pamphlet written by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says "the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks is called early pregnancy loss. Often the loss is a miscarriage (sometimes called spontaneous abortion by doctors)." Where does that leave us?

pomt-05896	The Georgia Secretary of State's Office and the Georgia State Elections Board investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election fraud.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/06/brian-kemp/kemp-makes-case-voter-id-law/	The political divide in Georgia these days often stretches as far and wide as rush-hour traffic on I-285 -- even to seemingly simple issues such as which forms of identification people can use to vote. Some say Georgia’s stricter policies on voter ID are a way to keep the poor and racial minorities from voting. Those in charge of enforcing the law counter that it helps prevent voter fraud. "I can attest that every year we investigate and penalize hundreds of people guilty of election and voter fraud," Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp wrote The Washington Post in June. He’s made similar statements in the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers have asked us to fact-check such statements. In June, PolitiFact Georgia checked out a claim by Kemp that the elections board had handed out about $275,000 in fines for violations of Georgia’s absentee ballot law. The number of cases since 2007, by our count, was 59. Could the state really have investigated and handed out fines in so many more cases each year? Matt Carrothers, a spokesman for the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, sent us numbers outlining how many cases the State Elections Board reviewed in 2009, 2010 and 2011, along with the number of investigations Kemp’s office has opened. The annual totals: -- 208 in 2009 -- 234 in 2010 -- 205 in 2011 Some of the investigations consist of multiple people, so the actual number of people investigated could be higher, Carrothers said. "The numbers that we based that original statement on are not only factual, but the base line," he said. "The real numbers are higher." A detailed breakdown of each investigation wasn’t available, but the cases reviewed by the State Elections Board are on its website. The board reviewed 102 cases this year, as Carrothers said. The 2010 total we calculated of people who had cases before the board was about the same as what Carrothers told us. Some 2009 board public orders were not on the state’s website. From the information we’ve seen and what Kemp’s office shared with us, it appears Kemp’s office has investigated and penalized at least 200 people each of the past three years. That does qualify as "hundreds" as Kemp says. Our rating: True.	None	Brian Kemp	None	None	None	2012-02-06T06:00:00	2011-06-24	['None']
pomt-03181	Obamacare-caused paperwork will annually absorb 190 million hours or more--and Mount Rushmore could be built 1,547 times over "with the paperwork."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/03/ted-cruz/cruz-statement-about-obamacare-caused-paperwork-an/	Ted Cruz, the junior Republican senator from Texas, said the health care overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama would create mountains--or at least Mount Rushmores--of paperwork. In Senate floor remarks on July 30, 2013, Cruz said: "According to federal agency estimates, Obamacare will add paperwork burdens totaling nearly 190 million hours or more every year. And... to put that in perspective, Mount Rushmore, which took 14 years to build, could be constructed 1,547 times with the paperwork." By email, a Tennessee doctor asked us to investigate. Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Utah Sen. Mike Lee have taken center stage in a campaign from the right to "defund" changes set to roll out under the Obamacare law. The senators and their supporters declare that otherwise the economy will be gutted. And to spread their message, they’ve released online ads and held town halls. Without a doubt, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is highly complicated and extensive; the text runs 974 pages. Does it generate millions of hours of paperwork? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier directed us to the Obamacare Burden Tracker, an 18-page document issued in February 2013 by the Republican sides of three House committees. It states that per six agencies--including the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Social Security Administration--the Obamacare law will result in 189,822,836 hours of paperwork a year, plus nearly 80 million once-only hours. Frazier also pointed us to the National Park Service’s website, which says Mount Rushmore was built between Oct. 4,1927, and Oct. 13, 1941, or a little more than 14 years. And, she sent us to a May 7, 2013 Energy and Commerce Committee press release that says those 14 years could be used to construct 1,547 monuments. Here is what we take to be the relevant equation: The Burden Tracker’s 189,822,836 hours divided by 24 comes out to 7,909,284.83 days, equal to 21,669.27 years. Divide that by 14 and you find out that during 21,669.27 years, there are 1,547.8 spans of 14 years. Let’s review the paperwork details, then tackle those mountains. Committee explains tracker The Burden Tracker was described in a Feb. 6, 2013, press release from the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee as "a real-time online resource to help the public keep track of all of the new government mandates, rules, and red tape as a result of Obamacare." The release said that burden would fall on individuals, businesses and health care providers. The tracker was updated in May 2013 and is to be updated every few months, according to Ways and Means Committee spokespeople. When we peeked, the tracker listed 174 separate Obamacare-related paperwork tasks, each one leading to online documentation intended to show the associated paperwork hours. The tracker says, for instance, that according to Health and Human Services and two other agencies, changes to coverage for certain types of care, including contraceptive services, would require 2.5 hours of paperwork each year from health organizations. Meanwhile, regulations for government-funded insurance programs would generate paperwork for hospitals and other groups absorbing 45,982,371 million hours annually, which is the tracker’s largest single entry. By phone, Sarah Swinehart, a staff spokeswoman for the Republican side of the Ways and Means Committee, told us that staff members went through federal documents that list all paperwork associated with the regulations for government-funded insurance programs to reach the 45.98 million figure. We tried to follow similar steps, but ended up with a much smaller sum of several million hours. When we shared our tally with Swinehart, she said the committee didn’t have anyone available to explain in detail how its 45.98 million number was reached. We also couldn’t confirm the smallest paperwork burden of 2.5 hours, which did not appear in the documents referenced in the tracker. Michelle Dimarob, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee’s Republican office, said by email that most of the paperwork hours came from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is part of the Obama administration’s Office of Management and Budget. Congress created the regulatory office in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Swinehart said committee staff members built the tracker by using a search function on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website. It allows users to check a box that filters out all paperwork burdens related to the Obamacare law, Swinehart said. In the most straightforward instances, she said, a provision by itself created a paperwork burden. In sticky cases, she said, the law was among several contributing to a paperwork burden, which meant committee staff had to extract the Obamacare-tied burden. To do so, she said, staff looked at documents in the Federal Register, which include paperwork burden estimates. We drew no comment on the accuracy of the tracker from Health and Human Services as well as the OMB and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office and Government Accountability Office. Spokespeople for each agency also said they had not estimated paperwork burdens related to the law. Examining the numbers Federal law defines a burden as the "time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, or provide information to or for a federal agency." Burdens can include gathering information, disseminating information to the public and installing technology. For context, the public spent 9.14 billion hours completing paperwork burdens for the federal government in 2011, according to OMB’s 2012 Information Collection Budget, the latest available annual report. Obamacare’s supposed 190 million burden hours would represent a 2.1 percent increase from that 2011 figure. The Obamacare law is not alone in creating significant paperwork burdens, according to the information collection budget. A 2009 change in how investment companies are regulated resulted in 33.5 million hours of additional paperwork a year, a figure that was based on forms that mutual funds had to newly fill out to report information to the public and the IRS. Perhaps a more familiar burden, one that college students and their families bear, is the estimated 26 million hours total it takes to fill out forms used to determine eligibility for financial aid. Before a federal agency can require the public to comply with a paperwork burden, it must seek public comment, and obtain review and approval from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Fabien Levy, a Washington, D.C.-based HHS spokesman, said by email that the health care law reduces some paperwork burdens, noting that applications consumers will use to enroll in health insurance under the law will be "simple and significantly shortened." When we looked, the tracker did not refer to reduced paperwork hours from enrollment applications. Among the burdens specified in the tracker are 21.3 million paperwork hours for insurance agencies related to changes in Medicaid eligibility and 10.8 million hours for health plans that will sell insurance under the law. In one case, the tracker suggests paperwork time will drop. New rules limiting how long it takes for insurance benefits to kick in will cut paperwork by 341,000 hours, according to the tracker. To sample the tracker’s accuracy, we looked into three of the largest identified paperwork burdens. Together, these burdens total 75,537,966 hours -- about 40 percent of the 190 million number aired by Cruz. One of those burdens comes from the Obamacare law’s menu-labeling provision requiring chain restaurants and vending machine operators to disclose nutritional information. The tracker says this provision will annually impose 14,068,808 hours in paperwork. A 2011 OMB report backs up that figure, listing it as one of five "significant burden increases." Another of the highest paperwork burdens, the 40,189,456 hours created by forms that small employers will use to figure out tax credits for health insurance premiums, was listed in a 2012 OMB report in an appendix attributing the burden to the Obamacare law. Our examination of other sizeable items in the tracker revealed miscalculations. For instance, the tracker overcounted 6.75 million hours it attributes to additional information that hospitals must report. A document from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that increase stems partly from a section of the Obamacare law, but also from the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. The document also says the 6.75 million hours hospitals spend reporting the information would save them 2.5 million hours they currently put toward giving the same information to accreditation groups. The tracker also incorrectly counted a preliminary estimate that regulations regarding Medicaid eligibility would generate about 11 million hours of paperwork. Health and Human Services updated that figure in March 2012, predicting it would create more than 21 million hours of paperwork. The tracker lists both the original estimate plus the revised one. We noticed as well that some listed burdens are from a college student loan overhaul rolled into the health care law. The tracker counted 2,232,386 hours of new annual paperwork for Stafford and Ford loans. Admittedly, we devoted only a few days to looking over the tracker. Still, it looks like at least 57 million of the listed hours--the 45.98 million that the Ways and Means committee couldn’t explain, plus the miscalculations we found--are factually unsupported or insufficiently documented. On the flip side, we found that at least 75 million hours of paperwork has been forecasted in connection with the Obamacare law. Experts weigh in Other issues may be worth chewing over, outside experts suggested. Donald Arbuckle, who was second-in-command at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs from 1996 to 2006, said by phone that any estimate of a law’s paperwork hours is "soft" because each federal agency uses a different method to calculate the hours. Some agencies, he said, are more diligent than others. Arbuckle, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas-Dallas, said that generally, such information helps track government activity. "Paperwork burdens are usually associated with government red tape, which is bad," Arbuckle said. "Except, one person’s red tape is another person’s accountability. If the government is putting money toward Medicare or Medicaid, using tax dollars, the government needs to be ultra, obsessively responsible" for "where that money is going." Chris Jacobs, a health care analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, emphasized by phone that the Obama administration recognized the large paperwork burdens created by the law by delaying the requirement for some employers to provide insurance to workers. In July 2013, the White House announced that it was delaying from 2014 to 2015 the law’s mandate that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees offer health insurance. In a July 2, 2013, agency blog post, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s assistant secretary for tax policy, Mark J. Mazur, wrote that the employer mandate was delayed because of "concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively." Building Mount Rushmores When we turned to the second half of Cruz’s statement--that the time spent on Obamacare paperwork could be used to build Mount Rushmore 1,547 times--we spoke to National Park Service Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Maureen McGee-Ballinger. Cruz’s calculation uses the total number of hours in 14 years--122,640. That assumes, in effect, that one person created Mount Rushmore by working around the clock for 14 years--or any other scenario getting to the hours’ total. McGee-Ballinger said by phone that there are no records of how many worker hours went into Mount Rushmore, which was created in South Dakota at a cost of nearly $990,000 ($15.7 million in 2013 dollars). A web search led us to Lou Del Bianco, who has researched his grandfather Luigi Del Bianco’s role in carving Mount Rushmore. By phone, Del Bianco said that some of the 400 people who built Mount Rushmore--doing tasks like blasting away granite with dynamite or carving the stone--worked only for half a year while others stayed for all 14. Their hours varied greatly, he said, and they didn’t work for about four to six months during the cold. Just to get a handle on how that might affect the numbers, we estimated the total hours if Mount Rushmore had been created by 400 people who each stuck with the project for 12 years, working 40 hours a week (which became the federal standard in 1938) for 32 weeks per year, or about eight months. We got 6,144,000 hours, which means they could build 30 Mount Rushmores in the Burden Tracker’s 189.8 million hours. To cook up a low-end estimate, we tweaked it to 400 people working three years each, putting in 40 hours a week but averaging only about six months of labor in each year -- say, 26 weeks. This time we got 1,248,000 hours, which means those efficient 400 people could build 152 Mount Rushmores in the hours aired by Cruz. When we reached out to Frazier, Cruz’s spokeswoman, about the seeming shortcomings of the tracker and the Mount Rushmore calculation, she did not speak directly to them. In an email, she noted that several lawmakers have relied on the tracker’s paperwork tally. Our ruling Cruz said the Affordable Care Act would "add paperwork burdens totaling nearly 190 million hours or more every year." He went on to say that Mount Rushmore could be built 1,547 times over "with the paperwork." Based on the 190 million figure, that mount count is ridiculously off, premised on the notion that one person carved the monument around the clock for 14 years--or something equivalent. And about the 190 million hours: the landmark law indeed appears responsible for creating a large amount, at least 75 million hours, of confirmed additional paperwork. However, that total is less than half Cruz’s declared number. The tracker that Cruz relied upon has unexplained holes, miscalculates some burdens and folds in paperwork associated with non-health-care programs such as student loan changes. Significantly, too, we could not tell how the document’s largest single entry--46 million of the declared hours--was calculated. We rate this statement, based on a partially unsupported hour count plus unrealistic Mount Rushmore math, as Mostly False. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

mpws-00033	Late last year, emergency unemployment insurance expired and U.S. House Democrats have been on a crusade to renew it even though their Republican colleagues aren’t interested. Democrats have been putting on the pressure this week, using social media to make their case. Here’s a tweet from Rep. Keith Ellison: “How does the end of emergency unemployment insurance affect the economy? 240,000 jobs. #RenewUI” That number comes from a partisan source.

pomt-02439	"Fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-fewer-black-latino-young-men-par/	In a high-profile event at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, President Barack Obama unveiled a new effort called the My Brother’s Keeper Initiative, designed "to help every boy and young man of color who is willing to do the hard work to get ahead." Obama told the audience -- a mix of African American and Latino youth and such public figures as basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson and former Secretary of State Colin Powell -- that he understood the challenges facing young people of color. "The only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving," Obama said. "So when I made a mistake, the consequences were not as severe. I had people who encouraged me, not just my mom and grandparents, but wonderful teachers and community leaders. … I firmly believe that every child deserves the same chances that I had. That's why we are here today, to do what we can in this year of action to give more young Americans the support they need to make good choices, and to be resilient and overcome obstacles and achieve their dreams." A group of prominent foundations have pledged $200 million over five years to improve early childhood development, school readiness, parental engagement, literacy, educational opportunity and school discipline. As Obama explained the challenges facing young black and Latino men today, he offered this statistic: "Fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men." We wondered whether that was accurate, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official repository for employment data. We used as our yardstick the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of the civilian population that is either employed or unemployed. ("Unemployed" refers to people who are not employed but who are actively looking for work.) In addition, we assumed that Obama was comparing youth labor force participation for black and Latino men to the rate for white youth, even though he didn’t explicitly say that. Given the context, this seemed to be the obvious interpretation. Finally, we had to determine a definition for "young." The most appropriate age ranges for which BLS offers data, we concluded, are 16 to 19 and 20 to 24. So we’ll look at the data for both of these ranges. Here’s a summary of what we found for January 2014, the most recent month for which data on the labor force participation rate is available. 16-19 years old 20-24 years old White men 35.1 percent 74.2 percent Black men 25.3 percent 66.2 percent Hispanic men 27.0 percent 77.1 percent So for Americans age 16 to 19, Obama is correct that labor force participation among black and Hispanic men trails that of white men. But the data for men age 20 to 24 are more mixed. Labor force participation among whites does exceed that of blacks, but the rates for Latinos actually exceed those of whites. (Latinos also have a higher rate for men age 25-29.) So on this score, Obama is only half-right. We checked with economists to see if they had an explanation for higher labor force participation rates. A big reason appears to be what happens in college. "Among the youngsters who complete high school, Latinos and non-Hispanic whites are now about equally likely to attend college, but a higher proportion of Hispanic youngsters drop out of high school before obtaining a diploma," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "In addition, Hispanic college enrollees are less likely to enroll in four-year colleges and less likely to be enrolled as full-time students. Generally, full-time students are less likely to work for pay or be looking for a job compared with non-students and part-time students." What this means, Burtless said, is that more young Hispanics are free to become part of the labor force. Another possible factor, Burtless suggested: A higher percentage of Hispanic young adults are not legal residents, so they may be ineligible for the student assistance and public aid that would permit them to be students and remain outside the workforce. "If you cannot legally obtain college aid or public assistance, or are afraid to ask for it, you are probably more likely to support yourself through work," he said. In the meantime, we also wondered whether having a higher labor force participation rate for those age 16 to 19, as whites do, is unquestionably a good thing, since it could reward high school dropouts who took low-wage jobs. "Participating in the labor force at this age would not seem to be an unmitigated good," said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. "Even at older ages, I wouldn't be against seeing more stay-at-home dads." Burtless said that among economists, the jury is still out on this question. "Many students can combine paid employment with satisfactory progress toward a high school or college degree, but obviously this would be a challenge for some young people who need to apply themselves hard in school in order to complete a degree," he said, adding that his own research suggests that the earlier in life that Americans start to work, the more money they earn later on. What’s less clear is whether late entry into the job market causes lower earnings, or whether people who go on to earn a lot of money simply love to work and start doing so earlier in their lives. Our ruling Obama said that "fewer black and Latino men participate in the labor force, compared to young white men." That’s true for black men age 16-19 and 20-24 and for Hispanic men age 16-19, but it’s not correct for Hispanic men age 20-24. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01447	Republican House candidate Marilinda Garcia "even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/03/americans-responsible-solutions/gun-reform-group-says-gop-candidate-congress-maril/	The liberal group Americans for Responsible Solutions asserts that New Hampshire Republican Marilinda Garcia holds views different from most of the state’s residents. In a 30-second spot titled "Strange Ideas," Americans for Responsible Solutions -- founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly -- says Garcia opposes raising the minimum wage, giving women the same pay as men for the same jobs, and gun ownership restrictions. Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. Representative from a district in Arizona. She was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011, and has since become a leading advocate for preventing gun violence. "Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas," the ad says. "Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it. Most people support guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work. Garcia’s against that, too. Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this article, we’ll take a look at whether Garcia "opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check." About halfway through the ad, an image is shown of a smiling Garcia holding a pink rifle in front of racks of other guns. The printed message says, "Garcia’s against closing gun loopholes." Lower on the screen, what looks like a newspaper clipping has the headline: "Online ads are the latest way gun buyers can avoid background checks." Another common loophole for people to buy firearms without a background check is at gun shows. As evidence for its claim, the ad cites an article from The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, titled, "Influential Hispanic Republicans rally around underdog Garcia in NH" published on June 9. When contacted, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, pointed to the article in The Hill and said that ensuring background checks for all gun sales has widespread support. The March interview cited by The Hill does not directly address gun show loopholes. Instead, Garcia is quoted as saying that lawmakers are "too reactionary sometimes," and pointed to the push for new restrictions on gun rights in the New Hampshire House, according to the article. "Clearly most of those were connected to mental-health issues, so why don’t we first identify what the real problem is before we end up sort of really infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens, because that’s what seems to be happening?" There’s some clearer evidence from Garcia’s tenure as a legislator. In February 2014, the New Hampshire House killed a bill, HB 1589, that would have required background checks for almost all gun sales. The intention of the law was to "protect public safety by helping to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill," according to the text of the bill, which was introduced by eight Democrats. There was never a roll call vote on the measure, but when it came time to debate the issue in the House, Second Amendment advocate J.R. Hoell proposed changing the law to "study the correlation between current New Hampshire law and the low violent crime rate in this state." Such a change would have vastly changed its original aim of requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. Garcia voted in favor of the amendment to change the measure, and it passed by two votes. Eventually the bill was scrapped by a vote of 242-118, with individual votes not recorded. More recently, in an email to PolitiFact, Cunningham didn’t offer a specific response to Garcia’s position on the issue but instead said, "Decreasing gun violence and maintaining the safety of every American is a top priority, but Marilinda knows that achieving this task does not generally involve imposing federal regulations on the 2nd amendment." So Garcia hasn’t really supported keeping the "gun show loophole" -- but nor has she clearly advocated getting rid of it. It’s also worth noting that the ad’s assertion that "dangerous criminals" get their guns through loopholes in the law is somewhat exaggerated. All kinds of people buy weapons at these shows, and that doesn’t make them "dangerous criminals." Indeed, experts says the most common ways criminals obtain guns is to get them through straw buyers, through less-than scrupulous online dealers, or by stealing them, according to a Frontline report, titled "how criminals get guns." Our ruling The ad claims that Garcia "even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check." Her comments on gun control, both past and present, are too vague to draw any real conclusion, but her vote to effectively water down a background-checks bill while serving in the state House does provide some support for the ad’s claim. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Americans for Responsible Solutions	None	None	None	2014-10-03T17:20:47	2014-09-16	['None']
pomt-10455	McCain says the price of a gas tax "holiday" would be about the same as "a Bridge to Nowhere (or) another pork barrel project."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/30/john-mccain/holiday-much-more-costly-than-mccain-suggests/	To give consumers a break from the high price of gasoline, Sen. John McCain has proposed a summer "holiday" from the federal gas tax. He wants the federal government to stop charging the tax (18.4 cents per gallon of gas, 24.4 cents for diesel) between Memorial Day and Labor Day. In an interview on the Fox News Channel on April 24, 2008, McCain was asked: "What would we sacrifice were such a thing to happen?" "Very little," McCain replied. "Maybe a Bridge to Nowhere, maybe another pork barrel project – and it should be made up by general revenues. Look, all I'm asking for is a little holiday." He then added, "We continue to see gas prices go up dramatically at gas stations. (The tax is) 18 cents a gallon for regular gasoline and 24 cents on diesel – and you know when I mentioned it, the special interests in Washington, you'd think I had said I am declaring the end of Western Civilization as we know it – 'Oh my God!' Look – the lowest income Americans drive the furthest in America. They want to take a little vacation this summer. Let's give 'em a little break." As a senator for 21 years, McCain has earned a reputation as a budget hawk who criticizes wasteful spending and preaches fiscal responsibility. But in this case, he dramatically understates the cost of his gas tax proposal. A gas tax holiday in June, July and August would actually cost the federal government about $9 billion in lost revenue, according to 2007 figures from the IRS. And McCain is way off with his suggestion that it could be paid for by eliminating the famous "Bridge to Nowhere" or another pork barrel project. He's referring to the Gravina Island Bridge in Ketchikan, Alaska, which a few years ago became the nation's most notorious federal project. Congress cut funding for the bridge after an outcry from critics who said it would benefit only a few dozen residents of the island. When Congress was considering the project, the federal cost was estimated at just over $200 million. (The latest projection of the total cost is $398-million, but the state has scrapped plans to build it.) Using the $200-million federal cost, it would actually take 45 Bridges to Nowhere to make up for the shortfall in gas tax under McCain's plan. He's also way off with his suggestion that the holiday could be paid for by eliminating a single pork barrel project. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that tracks federal spending, the average congressionally-supported project (they're known in Washington as "earmarks") is $1.3 million this year. So it would take more than 6,900 such projects to pay for the tax holiday – not one as McCain suggests. McCain's additional explanation – that it would be "made up by general revenues" – doesn't pay the bill, either. His gas tax holiday would have a substantial cost and he's misleading voters by suggesting it wouldn't. If he were off a billion or two, we might be more generous with our Truth-O-Meter ruling. But the Straight Talker's math is so far off that we've got to set the meter ablaze: Pants-On-Fire.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-04-30T00:00:00	2008-04-24	['None']
pomt-04339	Says Gov. John Kasich incorrectly claimed Ohio’s economy was 38th in the nation when he took office. "We were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/25/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-claims-john-kasich-undersold-condit/	As in 2008, Ted Strickland has been among President Barack Obama’s most enthusiastic campaign trail surrogates this year, serving as Obama’s national campaign co-chairman and regularly appearing on national media outlets to urge Obama’s re-election. The former Ohio governor has also been publicly pondering a rematch against John Kasich, the Republican who defeated him by two percentage points in 2010, and trying to burnish his own legacy as governor by arguing that the state’s economic recovery actually started during Strickland’s term in office. In an appearance Oct. 7 on CNN’s "State of the Union" with Candy Crowley, Strickland touted his own performance as governor as he argued with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine over whether Obama or Republican Mitt Romney would win Ohio’s presidential vote. After Crowley showed a clip from Kasich’s Aug. 28 Republican National Convention speech where the current governor argued that Ohio "needs a new partner in Washington," Crowley asked Strickland who’s responsible for Ohio’s relatively good economy. Strickland responded by accusing Kasich of "not telling the truth" during a part of the speech that immediately followed the excerpt that Crowley showed her viewers. "He said in that speech that Ohio’s economy was 38th, I believe, in the nation when he took office," Strickland told Crowley. "That’s not true, we were sixth in the nation in terms of economic job growth." Ohio’s recovery, Strickland said, began before John Kasich became governor. "If you look at the data, Ohio’s unemployment declined 1.6 percent in 2010. It declined another 1.7 percent in the first year and a half of the Kasich administration." Strickland went onto attribute Ohio’s turnaround to the Recovery Act and the auto rescue. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth, rather than 38th. We started with Kasich’s speech. What Kasich actually said was: "When I came into office, we were 48th in the nation in job creation. " Later in the speech, Kasich indicated his 48th in the nation comments cited job creation numbers from the four years before he took office -- which corresponds to Strickland’s term. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that between Strickland’s inauguration in January 2007 and his departure in January 2011, Ohio lost 372,300 jobs. Only two states - Florida and California - lost more jobs in that time, according to BLS data. That backs up Kasich’s contention that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation during the four years before he took office. We asked Strickland where he got his statistic that Ohio was sixth in economic job growth when Kasich took office. Strickland cited a 2010 report that he said was issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. His aide, Louis Capobianco, subsequently sent an email that provided an August 2010 table compiled by Reed Construction Data, which he said had come from the Federal Reserve report. Our search of reports released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia did not find that table, and the bank’s manager of media relations, Marliyn Wimp, said the bank did not release any reports that classified Ohio as the sixth fastest growing state. "That must have originated somewhere else," she said. Reed Construction Data, which compiles data for the architectural, engineering and construction industries in North America,did not return PolitiFact Ohio’s calls about the table. It places Ohio behind New Hampshire, North Dakota, West Virginia, Michigan and South Carolina in "recent economic performance" over the three months that ended in June of 2010. Another table on the same page ranked Ohio tenth from the bottom in the "Change in economic activity index - from 2007-2008 peak index value." An article on Reed Construction’s website said the table tracked "the state economic growth indexes calculated by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank from state employment and income data which are benchmarked to approximately track national GDP growth." The article said a manufacturing boom had pushed the industrial Great Lakes states past New England as the strongest regional economy after many years at the bottom of the list, and that economic expansion was underway in 46 states. PolitiFact Ohio also checked whether Strickland’s statements about Ohio’s declining unemployment were correct. BLS data bears out Strickland’s assertion that Ohio’s unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent during 2010, Strickland’s last year in office. The state’s unemployment rate fell from 10.6 percent in January of 2010 to 9 percent in January of 2011. From February of 2011 through August of 2012, it fell from 8.9 percent to 7.2 percent, as Strickland said it did. While Strickland might be correct that Ohio’s economic recovery began on his watch -- the state’s unemployment rate did begin to drop during the last year of his administration -- he was incorrect on the statistics he cited in criticizing Kasich. The former governor did not accurately cite Kasich’s words when he tried to rebut them on CNN. During his speech, Kasich said that Ohio was 48th in the nation in job creation when he took office. He did not say that the state’s economy was 38th in the nation, as Strickland maintained. What’s more, BLS data backs up Kasich’s assertion. Ohio’s rate of job creation did rank 48th relative to other states during Strickland’s term. So Strickland’s statement that Kasich "was not telling the truth" was itself incorrect. And the statistic Strickland cites to support his claim that Ohio actually ranked sixth in economic job growth is misportrayed. That statistic from Reed Construction Data refers to "recent economic performance," not "economic job growth," as Strickland said on CNN. It also examines a narrow three month period of time during 2010 - not the full four years of Strickand’s administration that Kasich’s speech referenced. On the Truth-O-Meter, Strickland’s claim rates False.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2012-10-25T06:00:00	2012-10-17	['John_Kasich', 'Ohio']

pomt-00313	Says Gov. Andrew Cuomo is "stealing money from the MTA and sending it upstate for projects that have nothing to do with transit."	false	/new-york/statements/2018/sep/21/marcus-molinaro/molinaro-makes-claims-about-cuomos-mta-record/	With the general election campaign in full swing, the attacks have begun as Republican Marc Molinaro tries to unseat Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. During a news conference in Manhattan, Molinaro criticized Cuomo’s stewardship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is responsible for New York City buses, subways, and commuter rail lines into Connecticut, Long Island and southeastern New York. Molinaro explained how he would do things differently than the incumbent. "We’re going to start by, instead of focusing on vanity projects and the colors of tiles in Midtown Tunnel, or by the way, stealing money from the MTA and sending it upstate for projects that have nothing to do with transit, we’re going to focus the New York state taxpayers’ dollars on signal switches, and subway cars, on platform rehab and accessibility," Molinaro said. Is Molinaro right? Did the governor steal money from the MTA to send upstate? Background The MTA carries 8.6 million riders on an average weekday and had an operating budget of $13 billion in 2017. Riders frequently face delays and deal with overcrowded trains and trains that break down, putting the transit authority in the spotlight. Molinaro ties his claim to a story published in the New York Daily News in July 2017. The newspaper reported that the MTA in 2016 had been instructed by the Cuomo administration to send a $4.9 million check to the Olympic Regional Development Authority. The authority’s finances had suffered because of a warm winter. The authority operates or manages upstate ski areas at Whiteface, Gore, and Belleayre mountains and the Lake Placid Olympic facilities. The Molinaro campaign provided only a link to a related news story as evidence of his claim. Direct transfer The state Division of Budget does not dispute that the MTA directly transferred $4.9 million to the Olympic authority, said spokesman Morris Peters. The state routinely charges state authorities for services that state government personnel provide them, and it has done so for years. Since at least 2010, the state has charged the MTA around $5 million annually for services it provided the authority, as it does for 13 other authorities, Peters said. Section 2975 of state law allows for "recovery of state governmental costs from public authorities and public benefit corporations." The state can collect money for staff time, equipment and facilities, and other services the state provides to support authorities. Under the law, the money is to be collected by the state treasurer and credited to the state’s general fund, though other appropriations can be made by the budget director. A portion of these payments is to be used to fund the authorities budget office. The MTA owed the state $4.9 million in 2016, and the Olympic authority needed the money soon because of the warm winter, Peters said. Sending the $4.9 million to the state’s general fund, so the state could then send it to the troubled ski areas, would create a delay, he said. These types of direct payments have happened for years. In more than a dozen instances since 2010, authorities were told to send their payment to another entity to deal with a critical budget need, instead of sending it to the state’s general fund. "It’s not the most transparent budget move in the world," said Rachael Fauss, a senior research analyst with Reinvent Albany, an organization focused on transparency in government. Though it’s "just not great policy," Fauss said, "it’s legal, it’s allowed." The Office of the State Comptroller, which reports on state finances, and is mentioned in the state law authorizing these payments, declined to comment on the claim. A spokesman referred us to an audit of the Olympic authority that was published two years ahead of the $4.9 million transaction. The audit recommended better cash management. The MTA also declined to comment on the claim. Our ruling The transfer of $4.9 million directly from the MTA to an upstate authority that manages ski resorts raised eyebrows when it was initially reported, because of the MTA’s financial and operational problems and because it prompted questions about whether it was a sound budget practice. Molinaro’s claim that the money was sent from the MTA to the Olympic redevelopment authority for non-transit projects is correct. State law, however, allows the state to recover money from authorities for the work that state agencies do on behalf of the authorities, contradicting Molinaro’s claim that Cuomo was "stealing" from the MTA. What's more, the $4.9 million could have been collected by the state regardless of who was governor. We rate his claim False.

pomt-13752	On gift taking, "Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what (Tim) Kaine took."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-tim-kaine-took-fraction-bob-mcd/	Donald Trump welcomed U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to the Democratic presidential ticket on Sunday by assailing the presumptive vice presidential nominee’s ethics. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump said Kaine accepted more political gifts than former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. That’s a big claim, because McDonnell, a Republican, stood trial for accepting $177,000 in undisclosed personal gifts from an entrepreneur who was seeking business with the state. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned McDonnell’s bribery convictions in June. "Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what Kaine took," said Trump, the GOP presidential nominee. "And I think, to me, it’s a big problem. Now, how do you take all these gifts? Hundreds of thousands of dollars." We wondered whether McDonnell’s gift-taking was, in fact, "a fraction" of Kaine’s. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for proof. So we set out on our own, comparing gifts Kaine received as lieutenant governor and governor from 2002 to 2010 to those McDonnell accepted as attorney general from 2006 to 2009 and as governor from 2010 to 2014. During those years, Virginia didn’t limit gifts to its politicians; the only requirement was that officeholders disclose what they accepted. We researched the online files of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit organization that keeps records of campaign contributions and financial disclosure statements filed by state politicians. Kaine According to VPAP, Kaine accepted $162,083 in gifts. Of that amount, $35,442 came when he was lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006, and $126,641 came when he was governor the next four years. Most of the money was for political travel. The gifts include $45,000 that Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign paid for Kaine’s airline and lodging expenses as a surrogate speaker. Also on the list were $20,000 in travel reimbursements from Moving Virginia Forward, a PAC Kaine set up for political expenses. He listed another $11,000 in travel financed by the Democratic Party of Virginia. Kaine also accepted some personal gifts. The largest was use of a political donor’s home in the Caribbean for a vacation shortly after Kaine was elected governor in 2005. On a disclosure form, Kaine estimated the in-kind value of the lodging at $18,000. He also accepted $5,500 in clothing from Stuart Siegel, chairman of S&K Famous Brands Inc. And he accepted a variety of tickets to football and basketball games and even a concert by the Dave Matthews Band. All of these gifts were disclosed. There have been no allegations that Kaine accepted undisclosed gifts. McDonnell According to VPAP, McDonnell disclosed $275,707 in gifts. Of that amount, $60,293 came when he was attorney general, and $215,414 came when he was governor. Some of the money was used for political travel, but it’s hard to get an idea of how much, because McDonnell did not consistently report the purpose for his travels. Some of the gifts also went to McDonnell’s enjoyment, including at least $34,000 in tickets and travel to Washington Redskins and University of Notre Dame football games. In addition, as we noted earlier, McDonnell and his family accepted $177,000 in undisclosed gifts and special loans from a businessman who was seeking the state’s help in marketing a dietary supplement. These gifts included a $6,000 Rolex watch; use of the businessman’s vacation home at Smith Mountain Lake; $15,000 for the catering bill at the wedding of McDonnell’s oldest daughter, as well as a $10,000 wedding check to her; and a designer gown for McDonnell’s wife. All told, McDonnell’s disclosed and undisclosed gifts come to $452,707. Our ruling Trump, speaking about gift-taking, said, "Bob McDonnell took a fraction of what (Tim) Kaine took." Kaine accepted $162,083 in gifts as lieutenant governor and governor, all of which was disclosed as required by state law. McDonnell disclosed accepting $275,707 in gifts as attorney general and governor. And there was another $177,000 that he didn’t disclose. That comes to a total of $452,707 in gifts - almost three times Kaine’s total. Trump has got this one dead wrong.

pomt-15117	"The Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-deal-will-facilitate-and-accelerate-/	Along with Donald Trump and the Tea Party Patriots, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke out harshly against a nuclear agreement with Iran at the U.S. Capitol. When the rally was over, Cruz followed up by tweeting out video clips of some of his comments. "The #IranDeal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons," he said in a tweet on Sept. 9, 2015. His comment caught our attention. We wondered whether it was accurate that the agreement would actually make it easier -- not harder -- for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. What the deal will do First, let’s recap what the deal would do. Broadly speaking, Iran would agree to accept strict curbs on nuclear technologies and intrusive access by nuclear-weapons inspectors for 10 to 25 years, with a pledge to abide by existing international treaties limiting its nuclear ambitions in perpetuity. In exchange, international economic sanctions against Iran would be lifted, as long as Iran doesn’t cheat. If Iran did cheat, sanctions could be reimposed. Specifically, the deal requires Iran to give up 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium, as well as most of the centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium. In addition, Iran agrees to only enrich uranium to a level unsuitable for weapons for 15 years, and to cease production of plutonium, the other element that can be used to build a bomb. Known nuclear sites would be monitored for 15 years to confirm compliance, and inspectors would have the ability to enter undeclared sites suspected of nuclear use, though with possible delays of up to 24 days. If Iran were to abide by these rules for 10 years, scientists say it would take them at least 12 months to build a weapon. Cruz's case Cruz’s staff did not respond to inquiries for this story, and we could find only one nuclear-policy expert who thought Cruz’s claim may have some merit. Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it depends on whether and when Iran cheats on the deal. "There’s a some degree of assumption that Iran will cheat in this, which isn’t entirely unreasonable given Iran’s history," she said. "Let’s say Iran abides by the deal just long enough to have sanctions lifted and lucrative contracts signed, and then pulls out, you can make the case" that Cruz does, she said. This might mean Iran sticking with the agreement for two years, then pulling out and pursuing a weapon, Dodge said. Still, even this scenario -- problematic though it would be geopolitically -- would enable two years of tight international scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear program that would not otherwise exist without the agreement. And it’s not as if today’s economic sanctions against Iran are expected to live on if the agreement fails to be enacted. Most observers assume that U.S. allies will begin loosening key sanctions whether or not the agreement is implemented. "The European Union has already begun the process of suspending its sanctions on Iran, and the U.N. Security Council likewise wasted no time in passing a resolution for sanctions relief, though it delayed implementation for 90 days," Suzanne Nossel, a former deputy assistant secretary of state at the U.S. State Department, recently wrote in Foreign Policy. "While congressional naysayers now trumpet the success of sanctions and demand that they remain in place, experts uniformly affirm that their effectiveness depends on wide multilateral support." Obstacles to an Iranian bomb All the other nuclear-policy experts we checked with said the deal puts roadblocks in the way of Iran's effort to pursue a nuclear weapon -- roadblocks that wouldn’t exist if the deal simply fell apart. They said that Cruz's statement went too far. "The logic is astounding," said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. "Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon." Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School, agreed, calling Cruz’s logic "bizarre." "The terms of the deal require Iran to reduce its installed centrifuges by two-thirds, eliminate almost all of its stock of enriched uranium, modify its Arak reactor to drastically reduce its ability to produce plutonium, and to accept much broader inspections," Bunn said. "Those actions would slow and impede any nuclear weapons effort, not facilitate and accelerate it." This is not to say that there is no case to be made against the agreement. Opponents have argued that it simply delays by a decade or so Iran’s eventual acquisition of a bomb, or that the United States and its allies should have negotiated stronger protections, or that by agreeing to the deal, the United States is giving its tacit approval to Iran moving toward a bomb after the deal’s strongest provisions expire. But compared to letting the deal evaporate, it’s hard to see how enactment of the deal makes it easier for Iran to get a bomb. Our ruling Cruz said, "The Iran Deal will facilitate and accelerate the nation of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons." The Iran deal may be less than perfect, but experts say it’s hard to see how implementing the agreement -- rather than doing nothing at all -- would actually "facilitate and accelerate" an Iranian nuclear weapon. The worst-case scenario would be that the deal throws up a couple years’ worth of roadblocks that would not exist otherwise. We rate the claim False. Correction: The Iran deal requires Iran to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 97 percent. A previous version of this fact-check described the reduction differently.

pomt-08192	Says the House Rules Committee is the only panel, other than the Intelligence and Ethics committees, not able to telecast proceedings in its main hearing room.	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/25/john-boehner/transparency-pledge-sparks-call-cameras-house-rule/	Once it was sunshine. The current buzzword for openness in government is transparency. In practice, it means conducting business in public view and access. Democrats and Republicans alike have espoused the idea publicly, but Ohio Republican John Boehner, Speaker-elect of the House of Representatives, made it his issue in January 2010, when he criticized Democrats for what he called a lack of transparency during debate on health care reform. "Every issue of national import should be debated by the people's elected representatives in full public view," he said. A call for more transparent government was part of the "Pledge to America" promoted by congressional Republicans in September. Boehner put particular importance on the installation of cameras in the hearing room of the powerful House Rules Committee, which was included in the House GOP Congressional Transparency Initiative that Boehner introduced. Now, the GOP Leader Blog on Boehner's website says Republicans have asked House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Strodel to begin installing video cameras in the Rules Committee hearing room. The House Rules Committee is the only panel, other than the Intelligence and Ethics committees, not able to telecast proceedings in its main hearing room, the posting on Boehner's blog says. He cites language in a formal request by the panel's ranking Republican, David Dreier of California. PolitiFact Ohio, never willing to miss a chance to do a little House-keeping, made its own call to the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which is responsible for the operating infrastructure of Congress. Dan Weiser, communications director for the chief administrative officer, said it’s true: Rules, Intelligence and Ethics are the only three committees lacking cameras in their main hearing rooms, of 25 committees in the House. Each committee has its own rules for use of the cameras and for coverage, he added. In looking at transparency, however, it’s worth noting that C-SPAN, the cable industry's public-affairs network, has upped the ante by asking Boehner for permission to install its own cameras in the main House chamber to cover activities on the floor. C-SPAN now uses the video feed provided by House-owned cameras for its cable telecasts and free online streaming. Brian Lamb, C-SPAN's founder and chief executive, requested the addition of "a few small robotically operated cameras in the House chamber," and reminded Boehner of his support in January for C-SPAN's request to televise health care negotiations. "Currently," Lamb wrote in a letter to Boehner, "House floor debates are not in full public view because private news media cameras are still not permitted in the House chamber. Rules established when the House installed its TV cameras in 1979 restrict congressional camera operators to head-on shots of members at the podium and committee tables, and they are prohibited from taking reaction shots or shots of the chamber, leaving viewers with a less-than-complete view of your debates." C-SPAN, which said it would make its feed available to accredited news organizations, made similar requests to Republican Newt Gingrich in 1994 and Democrat Nancy Pelosi in 2006. Boehner press secretary Michael Steel responded that the speaker-elect "is committed to making the House more transparent and accountable. "A number of media outlets, including C-SPAN, have requested the ability to install private cameras in the House chamber," Steel said. "While no decisions have been made at this time, these requests are under review." But cameras will be installed in the hearing room of the Rules Committee -- which has been the only panel besides the Intelligence and Ethics committees lacking them.

pomt-04468	"This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/09/american-crossroads/ad-says-barack-obama-promised-jobless-rate-would-b/	A new ad claims President Barack Obama broke his promise about the impact of the economic stimulus plan. The ad uses a familiar Republican talking point, that Obama "promised" low unemployment if the stimulus was passed. We've checked many claims it would stay below 8 percent, but this ad says it would drop to 5.6 percent. It's a flashy ad from pro-Republican super PAC American Crossroads, using gleaming Minority Report-style graphics manipulated by a narrator in an empty warehouse. The version we've seen still running this week uses an outdated number, saying unemployment is "actually" 8.1 percent. The latest monthly report, which came out Friday, says it is now 7.8 percent. In this fact-check, we’re focusing on what Obama said the jobless rate would be if Congress passed a stimulus plan. Separately, we are checking the ad’s claim that "Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt." Here’s the full narration: "This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent. But this is what the jobless rate actually is: 8.1 percent. The difference? About 3.7 million jobs. Obama’s spending drove us $5 trillion deeper in debt, and now we have fewer jobs than when he started. What Obama promised vs. what he delivered." The screen displays the line, "We can’t afford 4 more years." What Obama said We asked American Crossroads for material to support the ad. Spokesman Jonathan Collegio referred us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report prepared before Obama took office, and a speech by the president-elect. The report, designed to help Obama argue for an aggressive response to the burgeoning jobs crisis, featured projections for the effect of a stimulus plan. Those estimates include a chart, "Unemployment Rate With and Without Recovery Plan," that displays a post-stimulus jobless rate around 5.6 percent in mid 2012, like the chart in the American Crossroads ad. But Christina Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser, also wrote that their estimates were "subject to significant margins of error," and "considerable uncertainty." We’ve previously ruled that the report was not a promise, but a projection, noting its several caveats. How about the president-elect’s speech introducing the report? Here, too, we find it's a stretch to describe it as a promise. It doesn’t get into specific jobless rates, but does talk about projected job gains if a stimulus plan — which Congress had yet to write — were to pass. Collegio pointed out that Obama: • Said the report presented "what this plan will mean," not "roughly what this plan might mean." • Said "we’ll create jobs" not "could create jobs." "Obama did promise it," Collegio said. But Obama’s speech first presents the report’s findings as "projections," and later says that a stimulus plan would "likely" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, "we’ll create" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure. Here’s how he sets it up: "I asked my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-Elect's Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Jared Bernstein, to conduct a rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections of how many jobs it will create — and what kind of jobs they will be. Today, I am releasing a report of their findings so that the American people can see exactly what this plan will mean for their families, their communities, and our economy. The report confirms that our plan will likely save or create three to four million jobs." And as we mentioned, the report carried Romer and Bernstein’s warnings about the uncertainty of their projections, including that "the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009. Our ruling An ad from American Crossroads says, "This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent." But we find that's a stretch. In the evidence the group provided, Obama doesn’t mention that statistic. Rather, he introduced "projections" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5.6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates’ "significant margins of error" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02087	David Beckham’s soccer stadium would get a "special tax deal that lets them off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/may/20/miami-seaport-alliance/david-beckhams-soccer-stadium-would-be/	"Tax deal" and "stadium" are fighting words if you put them in the same sentence in Miami-Dade County. Taxpayers were so angry over the public financing that paid for most of the Miami Marlins ballpark -- which failed to produce big crowds or revitalize the area -- that they recalled County Mayor Carlos Alvarez and Commissioner Natacha Seijas. Now opponents of David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at PortMiami are trying to tap into voters’ distaste for tax breaks in a TV ad that shows concerned looking couples paying bills: "Why won’t the out of town port stadium developers tell us about the special tax deal that lets them off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years. You think you could not pay taxes for 30 years? Now we find out it's Miami-Dade families who have to pay taxes to help give them parking garages." The music then turns sinister as a photo of the boogeyman in Miami sports -- the Marlins’ stadium -- appears on the screen. "Remind you of anything?" the narrator asks. "Miami deserves better." The ad is paid for by the Miami Seaport Alliance, led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, which fought against the stadium site at the port close to the cruise line’s headquarters. PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked an alliance ad that the port stadium proposal "threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries" and rated it False. Here we will fact-check the statement that Beckham will be "off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years." The ad ran on TV in mid-May days before Beckham announced that he would drop the port site in favor of a site downtown. The tax deal that the ad mentioned still exists regardless of the site, however. Legislature approved sales tax subsidy The site now favored by Beckham would involve filling in a boat slip downtown. The city and county both own portions of the site, making the deal somewhat complicated. The Miami Herald reported that a possible agreement could involve the stadium not paying property taxes but making an annual payment in lieu of taxes to the city and rent to the county. This site has its detractors, including environmental activists and those who oppose building along the shoreline. The ad doesn’t explain what type of "tax deal" Beckham is seeking. The answer: Beckham says he will privately finance construction of a stadium, but plans to apply for a state sales tax subsidy. This spring, he worked the halls of Tallahassee posing with legislators taking selfies as he lobbied for the deal. The TV ad pointed viewers to House Bill 7095, which was approved by the state Legislature by wide margins in May. Scott has said he plans to sign the bill. The bill adds soccer to the types of sports franchises that can compete for sales tax rebates for construction projects. Here’s how it works: When fans buy certain items at the stadium -- such as t-shirts or food -- they pay a sales tax. That amount is 7 percent including a 1 percent add-on for Miami-Dade. Typically a little less than 90 percent of sales tax is distributed to state general revenue which can go toward everything from fixing roads to paying teachers or prison guards. Most of the remainder is shared with counties and cities which can also use them for their general revenues. But under the bill, sports facilities, including the Miami soccer stadium, would get a rebate of 75 percent of the sales taxes from the new development. And the bill speeds up the process for Beckham’s stadium in Miami, as well as an Orlando soccer stadium and the Daytona International Speedway. The three projects could share in about $7 million in tax breaks next year, according to the Miami Herald. Beginning in 2015-16, a total of $13 million would be available to multiple sports franchises, including soccer, football and NASCAR. The amount of potential annual subsidies escalates based on the size of the investment -- construction projects of more than $200 million could get up to $3 million a year for 30 years, while projects in the $100 million to $200 million range could get $2 million a year. The stadium at the port was estimated to cost $250, including additional infrastructure costs, but the cost of the downtown site wasn’t immediately clear. The state Department of Economic Opportunity would rank the proposals from sports franchises, but the Legislature would make the final call. Teams would be forced to return the money if they generated less sales tax revenues than anticipated or left the state. We sent the ad to spokespersons for Miami Beckham United, who did not dispute the amount of the tax subsidy cited in the ad. "These funds are considered a sales tax rebate for spending generated by stadium activity that would otherwise not occur, such as fans buying a hot dog at the game, a t-shirt at the team store or a meal at a stadium restaurant," said John Alschuler, strategic advisor to Miami Beckham United. We also sent the ad’s statement about the special tax break to Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed organization that takes a critical look at state taxes and spending. "As is often the case with these things, it’s a matter of semantics. It is not a tax break. It does not let anyone off the hook for taxes," Wenner told PolitiFact Florida. Sales taxes are still collected on sales at the stadium, but the owners get a subsidy of 75 percent of the additional sales tax collected due to the project. "So, it is not a tax break, but the result is basically the same, recipients will get up to $3 million annually of taxpayer money." Our ruling The alliance’s ad says Beckham’s soccer stadium would get a "special tax deal that lets them off the hook for $2 million in taxes every year for 30 years." The ad correctly cites the numbers, though it omits some caveats: Beckham could get at least $2 million every year for 30 years, in the form of a sales tax subsidy. But it’s not an automatic slam dunk, since Beckham would have to apply for it. Though Beckham’s star power certainly influenced legislators to add soccer to the list of eligible franchises, it’s not a "special tax deal" exclusively for Beckham’s project. The main point of this statement is largely correct: Beckham is poised to get at least $2 million a year in rebates from the sales tax. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05841	Says the Congressional Budget Office said "unemployment could top 9 percent in 2013"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/15/us-chamber-commerce/citing-Congressional-budget-office-chamber-ad-says/	This ad is a positive push for business-friendly policies and politicians, brought to you by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But in making its case, the video ad aimed at Illinois voters includes a couple of scary phrases: • 13.1 million Americans out of work • CBO: Unemployment Could Top 9 percent in 2013 We wondered if the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan arm of Congress that analyzes the financial impact of federal laws, is really projecting that high an unemployment rate next year. The CBO report The CBO’s Budget and Economic Outlook report for 2012 through 2022 looks at numerous economic benchmarks and how existing and possible legislation will affect them. The day the report was released, Jan. 31, 2012, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf wrote in his blog a bit about the methodology behind the report. "Each January, CBO prepares ‘baseline’ budget projections spanning the next 10 years. Those projections are not a forecast of future events; rather, they are intended to provide a benchmark against which potential policy changes can be measured," he wrote. The benchmark unemployment figure for 2013: 9.2 percent, the level cited in the chamber ad. But again, benchmark numbers are "not a forecast." ‘Alternative fiscal scenario’ To create its forecasts, the CBO moves beyond benchmarks and makes some assumptions that popular programs and tax policies will be retained, as they have been in past years. In the scenario CBO created: • Expiring tax cuts are extended. Those include income tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush and extended in 2010, as well as lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends. • The Alternative Minimum Tax is indexed for inflation. The AMT, targeted at the wealthy, does not take inflation into account. But according to the Tax Policy Center, since 2001 Congress has repeatedly increased the individual AMT exemption on a temporary basis to prevent middle-class taxpayers from being subject to the tax. • Medicare's payment rates to doctors are held at their current level and not allowed to drop. • More than $100 billion in automatic spending reductions required by law do not take effect. We asked Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, about the reasonableness of that scenario. "There are an infinite number of scenarios one could create. The one they’ve chosen is in line with what I would call the dominant view of how things are going to turn out," Williams said . "It’s a set of numbers people want to see." Under this more politically realistic scenario, the CBO forecast that in 2013 unemployment would not top 9 percent. It predicts a rate between 7.4 percent and 8.9 percent. The CBO's benchmark figure is higher than the forecast because, if Congress did nothing, the tax cuts would expire, triggering a big tax increase which would suck money out of the economy. As a result economic growth would be slower. And that would lead to higher unemployment, Williams said. U.S. News & World Report story The chamber ad pulled the headline from a Jan. 31, 2012, story in U.S. News & World Report. It led with this ominous paragraph: "Alarming news came from the Congressional Budget Office today: the economy is on track to grow by only 1.1 percent next year, with unemployment climbing to 9.2 percent." But in the very next paragraph, the U.S. News story explained what Elmendorf outlined as the more likely alternative scenario: "...That is, if Congress does nothing. Under current law, a bevy of tax breaks, such as the temporary payroll tax cut, will expire in coming months and years, along with the extension in unemployment benefits. The story went on to point out that the Federal Reserve predicted unemployment in 2013 will hover between 7.4 and 8.1 percent. Our ruling The chamber ad flashed a headline saying "CBO: Unemployment Could Top 9 percent in 2013." But that figure represents a benchmark on which the CBO bases its forecast -- not the forecast itself. The CBO’s stated prediction puts unemployment at between 7.4 and 8.9 percent in 2013. The chamber ignored that reality, instead cherry-picking a higher number and making it sound like a prediction when it wasn't. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05150	"Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops, but 41 percent are on welfare."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-less-2-percent-illegals-are-pic/	A reader recently sent us a Facebook post with "10 Illegal Alien Facts." One of them was, "Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops, but 41 percent are on welfare." We’ll examine each part of the claim. "Less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops" Farming has traditionally been a common occupation for immigrants from Mexico and other countries south of the U.S. border, including many who are here illegally. According to figures compiled in 2005 by the Pew Hispanic Center from Census Bureau data, 19 percent of farming, fishing and forest workers were illegal immigrants -- the highest proportion of any broad employment category Pew studied. But as a share of all the jobs held by illegal immigrants in the country, farming does indeed represent a small percentage. About 3 percent of illegal immigrants were working in farming and related sectors, according to Pew, which was well below the percentage working in service occupations (33 percent), construction and extractive jobs (17 percent), production, installation and repair (16 percent) and transportation and moving (8 percent). A subsequent Pew study pegged the number working in farming and related sectors slightly higher, at 4 percent. Steven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, said it’s possible that during peak harvesting times, as many as 5 percent of the U.S. illegal immigrant population is working in agriculture. But in general, the statistics involving illegal immigrants are, not surprisingly, tricky to pin down. So we think that saying that "less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops" is reasonably accurate. "41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare" This half of the statement is more problematic. The most detailed statistics we found were from Camarota’s group. In a 2007 report, the center published a table titled, "Welfare Use for Illegal Alien-Headed Households." The table reported that 40 percent of illegal immigrant-headed households used any "major welfare" program in the previous calendar year. The percentage was even higher in illegal-immigrant headed households that included children: a whopping 71 percent, according to a a 2011 report by the center. So there is some basis for the 40 percent figure. However, it’s important to keep two bits of context in mind: • This statistic addresses households headed by an illegal immigrant. However, many of these households include American citizens within the family, often children who were born in the United States and who received citizenship at birth. Indeed, given the web of restrictions on the granting of government benefits to illegal immigrants, most of the "welfare" benefits being counted in the CIS table are going to citizen children, not to adult illegal immigrants. Indeed, the government is responsible for checking the immigration status of people receiving benefits. It’s true that some types of benefits, such as food stamps, can be shared among all members of a family. An illegal immigrant, for instance, may end up eating food bought with a citizen relative’s food stamps. Still, the Facebook post’s phrasing -- that 41 percent of illegal immigrants are on welfare -- is misleading because it ignores that the benefits in question are generally going to American citizens. • We suspect that when many people hear the term "welfare," they think of cash benefits. However, very little cash assistance is going to illegal immigrants. According to CIS, less than 1 percent of illegal-immigrant-headed households included anyone receiving direct government cash assistance, such as Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or state-run cash aid. This is not surprising: Illegal immigrants are generally barred from receiving such payments. Instead, the kind of "welfare" these households received were primarily one of two types: health care or food. In all, 27 percent of such households received coverage from Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor, while 33 percent received food assistance, such as free or reduced-price school lunches, food stamps, or benefits from the Women-Infants-Children program (WIC). As noted earlier, many of the recipients of these programs were actually citizen children of illegal immigrants. Few illegal immigrants received housing benefits, the other major category of assistance from the government, CIS found. Medicaid and food assistance certainly qualify as government benefits, and they cost the taxpayers money. But it’s less clear that they fit the commonly understood definition of "welfare." Our ruling The Facebook post’s first claim, that "less than 2 percent of illegals are picking crops," is close to correct. The post’s second claim, that "41 percent (of illegal immigrants) are on welfare" is misleading. Most of the "welfare" benefits in question are going to U.S. citizens who live in illegal immigrant households, not directly to illegal immigrants, and very little of it comes in cash form, which is the traditional definition of "welfare." On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-06-20T16:28:51	2012-06-19	['None']

pomt-03156	Says he would be first CPA to serve as Texas comptroller.	true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/09/raul-torres/farmers-lawyers-bookkeeper-and-ghost-no-cpas-have-/	When former state Rep. Raul Torres announced his run for comptroller, he claimed a historic advantage: "I’m a certified public accountant and would be the very first CPA to serve in this office," he said in an Aug. 27, 2013, online campaign video. Torres, a Republican elected in 2010 who served one term representing Corpus Christi’s District 33, has been a certified public accountant since 1993. Later in the video, he said, "Can you believe that this office, which manages your tax dollars, has never had an accountant as its head officer?" Well, can we believe it? Torres told us by phone that he and his campaign staff checked Wikipedia and other online sources for biographical information on Texas comptrollers back to 1896, when the first CPA certificate was handed out in New York. "I drew my own conclusion that there was no other person with the designation of CPA," Torres said. We started our research with current officeholder Susan Combs, who left the comptroller’s race wide open when she announced in May 2013 that she would retire. Combs spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us by email that she holds a law degree and directed us to her official biography online, but said the office had no biographical information on previous comptrollers. A word on the word, which some pronounce "controller" or "comtroller": The "p" snuck in there during the 15th century, an Oxford English Dictionary editor told the New York Times in 2010. It appears that Middle English "counteroller," a person who checks two scrolls against each other, crashed into French "compte," count. Texas’ comptroller of public accounts collects state taxes and predicts how much the state will be able to spend, among other duties, and checks to make sure the budget adopted by the Legislature every two years is balanced. Torres said the knowledge of professional standards and skills required to become a CPA, which include performing audits and making reliable estimates, would be of use in the job. Becoming comptroller doesn't require special qualifications, though. DeSilva said the eligibility standards are the usual ones for a Texas candidate: U.S. citizen, 18 or older, not a felon, etc. For information on comptrollers past, DeSilva suggested we consult the Texas State Library. There, reference and documents librarian Sue Troyan emailed us the Texas Almanac’s list of comptrollers since 1835, when the provisional government of the Republic of Texas created the office. The Republic’s first comptroller is listed as John H. Money, but that surname might be too good to be true; we found him identified as John H. Morey in older editions. For this fact-check we restricted ourselves, as Torres did, to comptrollers after 1896. At the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, general counsel Jerry Hill told us by email that none of the folks on our list popped up in the database of certificates issued since 1915, when the agency began administering CPA examinations. That helps considerably, but doesn’t cover our whole timespan, and it’s limited to CPAs who were certified in Texas. So we set to gathering descriptions from sources including the Austin American-Statesman archives, the Texas State Historical Association, the state cemetery and materials sent to us by Troyan and reference librarian Kay Schlueter at the Legislative Reference Library of Texas. Our full list of sources is at right. Here are the jobs we found Texas’ chief financial officers held before they became comptrollers: Richard Watson Finley In office 1895-1901 Justice of the peace, businessman, cotton warehouse owner, financial agent for Texas penitentiaries. Robert Marshall Love 1901-1903 Teacher, Confederate soldier, farmer, sheriff, U.S. marshal. Assassinated at his desk in the comptroller’s office by an ex-employee whom he had fired. Said to haunt the Capitol. John W. Stephens 1903-1910 Farmer, merchandiser, stockman, county district clerk, chief deputy U.S. marshal to Love and then chief bookkeeper under Love in the comptroller’s office. W.P. Lane 1911-1915 Businessman -- likely including a stint as manager of the carpet department at a dry goods store -- then a state representative. Henry Berryman Terrell 1915-1920 Farmer, merchant, newspaper owner, state representative, state senator. Mark L. Wiginton 1920-1921 A state representative in 1919; possibly an anti-Prohibition activist before that, based on a Dec. 9, 1904, report in the Itasca Item, and a speaker for a fraternal group offering life insurance, according to the Feb. 19, 1917, Bartlett Tribune and News. Lon A. Smith 1921-1925 Teacher, county clerk, state representative, state senator. Sam Houston Terrell 1925-1931 Second lieutenant in the Army during World War I, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs gravesite locator. Alleged fiscal misdeeds as comptroller led to an impeachment trial, during which he resigned. George Hartfield Sheppard 1931-1949 Teacher, county tax assessor, city official, insurance businessman. Robert S. Calvert 1949-1975 Army Air Forces; worked for a railway and an electric company and was a bank teller before becoming a statistician in comptroller’s office and chief clerk in comptroller’s office. The longest-serving comptroller was among the most controversial; in 1973, aged 81, he drew notoriety by using a racial slur to describe Eddie Bernice Johnson (then a state representative from Dallas, now a U.S. representative), who sought to have him impeached for racial discrimination. Robert (Bob) Douglas Bullock 1975-1991 Air Force, lawyer, state representative, assistant attorney general, secretary of state. Credited with modernizing the office and, eventually, most of Texas’ government as well. John Sharp 1991-1999 Army Reserve, Legislative Budget Board staff, state representative, state senator, state railroad commissioner. Carole Keeton Strayhorn 1999-2007 Teacher, Austin school board president, Austin mayor, state insurance board member, railroad commissioner. Susan Combs 2007-present Lawyer, Dallas County assistant district attorney, state agriculture commissioner. Only a few of the jobs seem related to accountancy: Stephens’ post as chief bookkeeper and Calvert’s stints as a statistician and then chief clerk, all within the comptroller’s office itself. But neither man, as far as we could tell, worked as a professional accountant outside the comptroller’s office. We figured that it was unlikely they would have sought certification. Our ruling Torres said he’d be "the very first CPA to serve" as state comptroller. We’re not judging here whether the comptroller needs to be a CPA. But we found nobody with that certification in the checkered past of the comptroller’s office, so we’ll rate Torres’ claim as True. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-09526	Despite touting the economic stimulus as a great triumph, "The very same report, however, notes that unemployment will average 10 percent for the rest of the year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/11/john-boehner/boehner-says-stimulus-no-triumph-if-unemployment-s/	Soon after the White House released the "Economic Report of the President" on Feb. 11, 2010, Republicans derided its boast that the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama may in time be viewed as "one of the great triumphs of timely, effective countercyclical macroeconomic policy." "Washington Democrats still don’t get it," House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a press release. "Two days after the president brushed off Republicans' concerns that Democrats' job-killing policies are causing great uncertainty for small businesses, the White House is now declaring in a new report that the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' will be one of history’s 'great triumphs.' The very same report, however, notes that unemployment will average 10 percent for the rest of the year. The Obama administration promised the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' would create jobs 'immediately' and keep joblessness below 8 percent." The report does, in fact, project that the unemployment rate will hover at about 10 percent through this year. With many press accounts of the economic report highlighting the forecast that job gains for 2010 will average 95,000 a month, those two facts may seem at odds. They are not. "A certain number of jobs need to be created every month simply to hold the unemployment rate stable," said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "That's because the working-age population is growing." In addition, as the job market improves -- or is even perceived as improving -- some people who had given up on looking for work may get back in the game and be added to the unemployed ranks. So there would have to be about 100,000 jobs added a month just for the unemployment rate to tread water. Even still, the report says, there's evidence the labor market is stabilizing. That's because the economy shed 691,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2009, 428,000 in the second quarter, 199,000 in the third, and 69,000 in the fourth. So to have the number of jobs increasing even moderately is an improvement. But Boehner's statement includes an assumption masquerading as a fact: It's that the stimulus has failed if unemployment rates remain at 10 percent through the year. While Boehner and other Republicans have long cited rising unemployment as proof that the stimulus hasn't created jobs, many reputable and independent economists say it has, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse without it. The "Economic Report of the President" estimates the stimulus has already saved or created 1.5 million to 2 million jobs, and is on track to save 3.5 million by the end of this year. We gave President Obama a Half True when he claimed in his State of the Union address that the stimulus has already saved or created 2 million jobs, because that was on the high side of projections from his Council of Economic Advisers, the independent Congressional Budget Office and several other reputable economic forecasters. But we should note all of those forecasters put the number north of 1 million jobs. In other words, just because the unemployment rate may stay at a whopping 10 percent, "doesn't mean that the stimulus didn't prevent an even worse catastrophe," Burtless said. As for the last bit of Boehner's statement, we gave a Barely True to House Republican Whip Eric Cantor and other Republicans who have continued to claim that Obama promised the stimulus would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent. That was a forecast based on where the unemployment rate was expected to go without a stimulus. That forecast was in line with other independent forecasts at the time, but proved overly optimistic, as Christina Romer, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged again in a press conference on Feb. 11, 2010. So Boehner is correct that the president's economic report forecasts the unemployment rate will remain at 10 percent through this year (even as jobs are added). But again, when Boehner cites that statistic as proof that the stimulus is having no immediate effect on jobless rates as promised, it ignores the possibility that if not for the stimulus the unemployment rate might be even worse. Many economic forecasters believe that's exactly the case. Still, projections about the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus are just that, projections. And many economists believe it is still way too early to measure its effectiveness. But we think it's misleading to simply point to a stagnant unemployment rate as proof that the stimulus isn't working. And so we rate Boehner's statement Mostly True.

pomt-07710	"The average (public school) teacher in Wisconsin’s making $89,000 a year" in salary and benefits.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/04/rand-paul/us-sen-rand-paul-says-average-public-school-teache/	Some of us might not believe Wisconsin’s budget battle had gone viral unless it was debated on national TV by, say, comedian David Letterman and, oh, a senator from Kentucky. Lo and behold: On the Feb. 24, 2011 edition of CBS-TV’s "Late Show with David Letterman," the inimitable talk show host raised the Wisconsin controversy with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Letterman asked: "Why don’t we just raise the taxes and let these folks have their collective bargaining, have their union representation and go back to their jobs?" Letterman’s reference was to Wisconsin public school teachers who had skipped school to protest Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill, which was introduced 10 days earlier. That measure would require most public employees to pay more for benefits, to help close a deficit in the state budget ending June 30, 2011. It would also eliminate collective bargaining rights for some public employees and sharply curtail them for others, a move Walker says is aimed at helping balance future state and local government budgets. Paul, a freshman senator and co-founder of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, responded to Letterman’s question by saying: "But I guess the argument is -- is, you have to look at the details and say: Have we been generous with (public school) teachers in Wisconsin? The average teacher in Wisconsin’s making $89,000 a year to work nine months." Is Paul right? The $89,000 claim prompted this comment from a guy named Tom on the Wisconsin Unions page of the Facebook website: "Holy cats, Batman, my wife is hiding $40,000 a year from her paychecks." Paul made a similar claim, varying his wording a little, a day earlier on ABC-TV’s "Good Morning America." He told host George Stephanopoulos that Wisconsin teachers "are making $89,000 a year. Their benefits greatly exceed the private sector." In the Letterman interview, Paul seemed to be saying $89,000 was the average salary for a public school teacher in Wisconsin. But on "Good Morning America," he seemed to suggest that the $89,000 included salary plus benefits, just as Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling did in making a similar claim that was assessed by our colleagues at PolitiFact National. We left messages with two staffers in the senator’s office, asking for clarification of Paul’s statements and for evidence to back up the figure, but got no response. In the Wisconsin budget debate, both sides have said it’s important to look at overall compensation -- pay and benefits. So, by that measure, is the average public school teacher in Wisconsin "making $89,000 a year"? The latest figures available are for 2009-2010, according to a state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. Public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary plus $25,325 in benefits for a total of $75,141. That’s about 16 percent less than the $89,000 claimed by Paul. The $75,141 total compensation figure, of course, is a statewide average. The figures vary across districts, according to tallies from the Department of Public Instruction. The average total compensation ranged from just over $55,000 in the Linn Joint 6 School District in Lake Geneva near the Wisconsin-Illinois border to just over $103,000 in the Nicolet district in suburban Milwaukee. Time for the Truth-O-Meter. Paul said twice on national television that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin "is making $89,000 a year." We’re assuming his figure isn’t just for salary, in which case his number would be too high by $40,000. But even if he meant salary plus benefits, his figure is too high by $14,000. We rate Paul’s statement False. Editor’s note: On March 8, 2011, this item was changed to correct an error in information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. In 2009-2010, public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary (not $49,093), plus $25,325 in benefits (not $25,750), for a total of $75,141 (not $74,843).

pomt-03362	In Rhode Island, 9 percent of workers use the state's temporary disability insurance program each year while in New Jersey, the rate is only 3 percent.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/14/patricia-morgan/rep-patricia-morgan-says-9-percent-rhode-island-wo/	Earlier this month, the General Assembly passed legislation intended to expand Rhode Island's temporary disability insurance program to allow up to four weeks of paid leave per year for workers caring for a seriously ill parent, child, grandparent or spouse or to bond with a new child. The bill, H-5889, will cover the costs by increasing the amount of money that is already taken out of each worker's paycheck for TDI. Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed the bill into law July 11, 2013. For the uninitiated, the state TDI program, pioneered in 1942 and the first of its kind in the United States, pays workers a portion of their lost income if they get sick for any reason. It is separate from worker's compensation, which pays workers if they are injured on the job. One opponent of the expansion plan was Rep. Patricia Morgan, a Republican from West Warwick. "There are only five states right now that mandate TDI. We're one of them. And we overuse it," she said. "I don't think we're an unhealthy place to live, but New Jersey, which also mandates TDI, only has 3 percent of their employees use the program in a year's time. Here in Rhode Island we have 9 percent. Something is out of whack." She also reported that "those 9 percent are using it an average of 11.4 weeks. You can only take 12 [weeks] so clearly people are kind of pushing it to the very end. We need to do a study first on why we overuse TDI before we start expanding it." Are Rhode Islanders really using TDI at a rate that's three time higher than New Jersey? We decided to check the numbers. Morgan said she got her data from Ken Block, head of Rhode Island's Moderate Party and candidate for governor, who made a presentation on TDI costs earlier this year. She sent us a copy of a slide titled "Usage of TDI in Rhode Island versus New Jersey" that he used in a presentation. In his presentation, Block said that, based on the 2011 annual report from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (RIDLT) , 35,836 out of Rhode Island’s 393,000 wage earners received TDI payments that year. That's 9.1 percent. But RIDLT spokeswoman Laura Hart cautioned that the 35,836 number is misleading. That's the number of claims filed each year, but it includes repeat claims from people who became sick more than once that year. To get closer to the number of individuals using the system, you have to look at the number of first claims for the year, also known as "new claims." (That statistic is not listed in the annual report.) That number for 2011 was 30,953. "If you divide that by the total universe of covered employees in 2011 (393,300), you get 7.9 percent," not 9.1 percent, she said in an e-mail. (The rate in 2012: 7.7 percent.) We also checked Block's figures for New Jersey. He said 3.77 percent of people covered by the TDI program there use the insurance each year. Once again, looking only at new claims, Block’s percentage was off, but only a bit -- the rate was 3.72 percent, according to data in the 2011 annual report by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. (Block gets other numbers wrong -- it's 101,627 claims, not 132,193 and 2.7 million workers were covered, not 3.5 million; but the percentage turns out to be comparable.) In short, Rhode Islanders use TDI at twice the rate of New Jersey, not three times more as Morgan indicated. Hart said it's difficult to accurately make a comparison. "RI and NJ run different TDI programs. Not only are they financed differently, but they don't cover the same universes. RI TDI is mandatory for all private sector employees. NJ, on the other hand, gives employers the option to offer state coverage or to buy private coverage. To get a true apple-to-apple participation rate for all private sector employees in NJ, you would have to include participation and coverage data for those with private coverage too." In addition, the rules for each state program are different. In New Jersey, for example, a government employee isn't eligible for disability benefits until all sick leave has been exhausted. And what about other states? We tried to get comparable rates of utilization for California, New York and Hawaii, the other states with TDI coverage, but we couldn't find a quick source for comparable information. So we'll leave it to others to determine whether Rhode Island is really out of line and, if so, why. Two more things. First, Morgan was off a bit when she said people who take TDI in Rhode Island are using it for an average of 11.4 weeks. The average duration was actually 11.2 weeks. In New Jersey, it's 10.1 weeks. More important, she was wrong to suggest in her comment that 11.4 weeks is close to a limit of 12 weeks. That's not the limit. It's up to 30 weeks per 12-month period, beginning when the person makes a claim. The actual allowed duration depends on the person's medically-certified health problem. Our ruling Rep. Patricia Morgan said that in Rhode Island, 9 percent of employees use TDI each year while in New Jersey, which also mandates TDI, the rate is only 3 percent. The actual rates are closer to 8 percent in Rhode Island and 4 percent in New Jersey. But New Jersey’s figures include only workers who receive state coverage, not private coverage. We don’t know how that would affect the usage rate there, but neither does Morgan. Because Morgan’s figures are so far off, the judges rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-02533	"I always supported civil unions."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/07/charlie-crist/he-changed-his-stance-gay-marriage-charlie-crist-s/	Charlie Crist, currently a Democratic candidate for governor, has apologized for his prior stance against gay marriage when he was Florida’s Republican governor. His change of heart isn’t that unusual for a politician in the past year or two, as national public opinion has shifted significantly toward support of same-sex marriage. In fact, Crist has tried to portray his evolution as being in line with that of President Barack Obama, who came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012 after favoring civil unions. Like Obama, "I always supported civil unions," Crist told reporters outside a Fort Lauderdale fundraiser Jan. 28. "But I thought about it just as President Obama thought about it, and I have come to the conclusion, as the Pope said himself, ‘Who am I to judge?’ I’ve always been a live-and-let live kind of guy. That’s what’s in my heart." Crist made similar claims that he supported civil unions in his political autobiography and in an interview with an LGBT publication. But is it the truth? Charlie Crist’s flip flop on gay marriage In May 2013, Crist came out in support of gay marriage on Facebook. "Some great news: On Tuesday, Delaware became the 11th state to allow marriage equality. And just a few days ago, Rhode Island adopted a similar measure, which followed victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington. I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here," Crist wrote. That was a reversal from 2008 when he voted for a state constitutional ban on gay marriage. We gave Crist a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for his reversal. His past record on civil unions, however, is more complex. Crist on civil unions in 2005 and 2006 In general, civil unions include many of the rights of marriage as it pertains to the state level. Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law, but several cities and counties have domestic partnership registries that afford residents some rights. Gay marriage advocates view both civil unions and domestic partnerships as inferior to marriage. The topic of civil unions surfaced in 2005 and 2006 when Crist, the state attorney general at the time, ran for governor in a primary against then-CFO Tom Gallagher. The constitutional amendment in the works in 2005 banned gay marriage but also included a phrase interpreted by some gay rights advocates and lawyers to ban civil unions, too -- that "no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized." In September 2005, Crist signed a petition in favor of the amendment at the request of the Christian Coalition. But in July 2006, Crist told radio talk show host Jim DeFede that civil unions for same-sex couples are "fine, but I support marriage between a man and a woman." Watermark, a Central Florida gay and lesbian publication, endorsed Crist in the homestretch of the Republican primary citing his support for civil unions. During the 2006 general-election debate, Crist said, "We respect civil unions and I do as well. I think it's fine if people want to introduce and go into agreements to be able to have funeral arrangements made, things of that nature. But I think that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman." Moderator Chris Matthews asked: What's the difference between a civil union and a marriage, legally, under the eyes of the law? Crist replied: "Under the eyes of this law, under the eyes of Florida, I believe that the difference is that civil unions are not the same as marriage. Marriage is a relationship like my mother and father had. Like I had before I got divorced. It is one of those unique institutions, not only in America but across the world where a man and a woman commit to one another. This is one of the things where I think it is fundamental, it is my belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman and it is different from civil unions." Crist on the 2008 amendment Amendment backers weren’t able to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot until 2008. Proposition 2 stated: "This amendment protects marriage as the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife and provides that no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized." During Florida Supreme Court oral arguments Chief Justice Barbara Pariente asked whether the amendment would prohibit "any legal sanction of a same sex relationship." "Absolutely not," replied Mathew Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, sponsor of the amendment. He also said it would not affect domestic partner registries. Justice Peggy Quince asked Staver if a same-sex couple entered some type of union in another state and moved to Florida whether that would be recognized in Florida. "It depends upon what that union was. If it was the substantial equivalent of marriage, then yes, it (the amendment) would prevent that..." Staver replied. Justice Raoul Cantero said the meaning of the phrase "substantial equivalent" would be open to challenge if the amendment should pass, though he added that it wasn’t a reason to keep it off the ballot. The Supreme Court ruled that the amendment passed the test of addressing only a single issue and containing clear language so it was allowed on the ballot. The ruling didn’t use the phrase "civil unions" but stated that the amendment could ban other types of unions. "The plain meaning of these words, according to dictionary definition, is clear that the chief purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that unions between same-sex couples that are treated virtually identically to marriage will not be recognized in Florida," the court held. By early 2008, Crist backed away from the topic and asked the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it and direct their efforts elsewhere such as helping presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. "I'll support it. I'll vote for it. Move on," Crist told the Orlando Sentinel in September. "It's not top tier for me, put it that way." On election day, Crist told reporters: "I voted for it. It's what I believe in." It passed with about 62 percent of the vote. In reality, what did amendment mean? There has been no subsequent challenge that would have tested the meaning of "substantial equivalent," because Florida doesn’t have a civil unions law. PolitiFact sent the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling to a few law professors and asked if the amendment would ban civil unions. What they generally said was it would depend on how closely such a civil unions law resembled marriage (though advocates of gay rights told us they questioned the point of drafting a civil unions law that would be so weak as to pass that test). "You could craft a civil union bill that is virtually identical or craft one that is not virtually identical," said University of Florida constitutional law professor Jon Mills. A statewide domestic-partnership registry law was approved by a state legislative committee in 2013 but later died. Supporters of the amendment fought the registry proposal. Crist on civil unions in 2010 During the Republican U.S. Senate primary in 2010, as he lagged behind his rival, Marco Rubio, Crist switched to run as an independent. Crist released a position paper in which he declared support for civil unions that "provide the full range of legal protections" including "access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families." Crist told CNN that he had supported a ban on gay marriage but added (once again) that he's a "live-and-let-live kind of guy. … I think if partners want to have the opportunity to live together, I don't have a problem with that." Following that interview, Crist put out a statement saying, "I am fully supportive of civil unions and will continue to be as a United States senator, but believe marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman." Crist’s adviser's response We sent a summary of our findings to Crist and to former state Sen. Steve Geller -- a Democrat who is informally advising Crist and whose law firm hosted the fundraiser where we heard Crist make the claim. "It simply isn’t fair to say that someone who votes on a constitutional amendment that has both provisions that he supported (prohibition on gay marriage) and provisions that he opposed (prohibitions on civil unions) necessarily is in support of both or against both," Geller responded. "Here, Charlie is clearly and unequivocally on the record as stating that he was in favor of civil unions. He stated this before Amendment 2 and after." Our ruling When asked about his changing stance on gay marriage, Crist said, "I always supported civil unions." Crist repeatedly made statements in favor of civil unions between 2006 and 2010. In fact a gay publication endorsed him in the Republican primary in 2006 because of his stance on civil unions. But Crist sacrified his support for civil unions by voting for an anti-gay-marriage amendment that could have also banned civil unions. As the amendment headed toward the ballot, news stories often quoted experts who said civil unions could be at risk if the amendment were to pass. That supposition hasn’t been tested, since a statewide law on civil unions hasn’t passed. But while Crist was clearly conflicted about the amendment -- he didn’t campaign for it and he urged the Republican Party of Florida not to spend money on it -- he ultimately did say that he voted for it. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-02-07T11:30:11	2014-01-28	['None']
pomt-14486	"It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/feb/26/cory-gardner/cory-gardner-flubs-high-court-history-exam/	Senators are digging deep for historic ammunition in refusing to consider any nominee by President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Some senators have been flunking their exams on Supreme Court nomination history. During a discussion on the high court’s election-year vacancy on Morning Joe this week, Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said, "It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee." (Watch the video.) HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER We looked hard at Gardner’s claim and found he fumbled the facts. Since 1895, there have been 14 times when a Senate controlled by a different party than the president’s party have confirmed his nominee. A Democratic-controlled Senate has confirmed a Republican president’s high court nominee 13 times from 1954 to 1991: 1991: Justice Clarence Thomas, President George H. W. Bush. 1990: Justice David Souter, President George H. W. Bush. 1988: Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Ronald Reagan. 1975: Justice John Paul Stevens, President Gerald Ford. 1971: Justice William Rehnquist, President Richard Nixon. 1971: Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., President Richard Nixon. 1970: Justice Harry Blackmun, President Richard Nixon. 1969: Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, President Richard Nixon. 1959: Justice Potter Stewart, President Dwight Eisenhower. 1957: Justice Charles Evans Whittaker, President Dwight Eisenhower. 1957: Justice William J. Brennan Jr., President Dwight Eisenhower. 1955: John Marshall Harlan II, President Dwight Eisenhower. 1954: Chief Justice Earl Warren, President Dwight Eisenhower. For the last time a Republican-controlled Senate gave the nod to a Democratic president’s high court nominee you have to go back much further to 1895, when the GOP Senate confirmed Justice Rufus Peckham, President Grover Cleveland’s nominee. The non-partisan National Constitution Center reports, "Of the 30 successful confirmations since 1945, 13 of the votes, or about 43 percent, came when the President's party didn’t control the Senate. This was especially true when the Democrats ran the Senate for long periods during the 1960s and 1970s." A spokeswoman for Gardner told us Gardner intended to cite a narrower example from a recent Washington Post story: "While the [Morning Joe] panel was discussing the Supreme Court vacancy in the context of a presidential election year, Senator Gardner referred to the fact that 'the last time a justice was nominated to the Court in a presidential election year and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party was 1888, when President Grover Cleveland nominated Justice Melville Fuller to be Chief Justice.'" It's true that in the 1888 presidential-election year, a Republican-controlled Senate confirmed not one but two high court nominees -- Melville Fuller and Lucius Lamar -- of Cleveland. But Gardner's actual comment cast a wider net -- with no reference to the 1888 "presidential election year." The senator's statement in a broader context: "If you look at the Constitution, the two clauses of the Constitution make it very clear the president shall nominate and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee." Our ruling Gardner claimed, "It's been since 1888 that a Senate of a different party than the president in the White House confirmed a Supreme Court nominee." While he may have intended to invoke the example of Supreme Court nominations in the 1888 presidential election-year, he didn't say that. What he actually said is just wrong, contradicted by 14 instances of a Senate controlled by a different party than the president approving a nominee to the high court. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00300	"Tony Evers says that tax dollars should pay for the abortions just like they pay for tonsillectomies."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/26/scott-walker/scott-walkers-claim-tony-evers-said-taxes-should-p/	A telephone poll conducted for the re-election campaign of Republican Gov. Scott Walker tested lines of attack on state schools superintendent Tony Evers, Walker’s Democratic challenger in the Nov. 6, 2018 election. The person conducting the poll, which was revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 17, 2018, would read a statement. Then she asked the person on the other end of the line if the statement would make her more likely, or less likely, to vote for Evers. One of the statements was: "Tony Evers says that tax dollars should pay for the abortions just like they pay for tonsillectomies." Evers didn’t say exactly that; but it’s close. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Medicaid To begin, let’s note that we will be talking about Medicaid. The state-federal insurance program provides coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. On abortion, federal law prevents states from using federal Medicaid money to pay for an abortion unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the abortion is necessary to save the life of the woman. States can use their own funds to cover other medically necessary abortions — usually defined by states as those to protect the physical or mental health of the woman — for Medicaid beneficiaries. In Wisconsin, Medicaid can be used to pay for an abortion if continuing the pregnancy would "cause grave and long-lasting damage to the physical health of the woman," according to the state Department of Health Services. Now to Evers’ comments. Weekly Standard article A couple of weeks before the poll, the conservative Weekly Standard published an article based on an interview it did with Evers. The article reported that Evers said tax dollars should be used to pay for abortions, just as they do for tonsillectomies. More specifically, this was the exchange: Weekly Standard reporter: One story I'm interested in is the role of pro-life Democrats: Do they have a place in the party? There've been fewer and fewer in Congress. What is your message to them? Do you want to see Medicaid funding of abortion generally? I know that's restricted in Wisconsin. Evers: Yeah, we have a big tent here in Wisconsin. We have to, in order to win elections. And yes, pro-life Democrats are welcome in the party, and I respect their decisions on this issue. But we need to have the Medicaid money be available for all people and restricting it because of a certain procedure, whether it's a tonsillectomy or any other procedure, seems to me a foolhardy thing to do. So, yes, we have to respect people's pro-life beliefs, and certainly they're welcome in the Democratic Party. Absolutely. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Evers’ remarks drew criticism from conservative media, anti-abortion groups and the Rev. Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Walker tweeted a link to the article. When we asked Evers’ campaign about his remarks, the campaign told us: "Tony was talking about access to reproductive care. He believes the government shouldn’t be in the business of coming between patients and doctors and that everyone should have access to affordable reproductive health care." So, when asked about Medicaid funding for abortion, Evers said the use of Medicaid, which is tax funded, should not be restricted by any procedure, which would include abortion. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Our rating Walker stated: "Tony Evers says that tax dollars should pay for the abortions just like they pay for tonsillectomies." Evers didn’t make that exact statement, but the statement is a reasonable way to describe what he said. A reporter had asked Evers: "Do you want to see Medicaid funding of abortion generally?" And Evers replied saying, "we need to have the Medicaid money be available for all people, and restricting it because of a certain procedure, whether it's a tonsillectomy or any other procedure, seems to me a foolhardy thing to do." So, Evers said the use of Medicaid, which is tax funded, should not be restricted by any procedure, which would include abortion. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-07915	In the past 20 years, Egypt has made "great strides" in political and democratic reform.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/31/sameh-shoukry/egyptian-ambassador-claims-egypt-has-made-great-st/	Egyptians took to the streets over the weekend to protest the authoritarian rule of President Hosni Mubarak and urge him to step down. The Egyptian ambassador to the United States, Sameh Shoukry, appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour to discuss the situation. Amanpour, reporting from Cairo, asked the ambassador how long Mubarak would "continue to tolerate this number of people in the streets?" Shoukry replied, "From the outset, the freedom of expression had been guaranteed. Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard. Freedom of expression, freedom of the press had been evolving and advancing with very important strides. I believe, in the president's speech, he indicated that there would be a guarantee of the freedom and ability of all Egyptians to express their points of view in a peaceful manner." That didn't answer Amanpour's question, but we were interested in his statement that the country has made "great strides" in political and democratic reforms. That was at odds with reporting we've read, so we decided to dig deeper to see if perhaps the ambassador was correct that Egypt has indeed been moving strongly toward more human rights over the past 20 years. We found that numerous human rights organizations have given Egypt low marks for political openness and press freedom. We did find a few examples of improvement, particularly among the press and bloggers. But organizations described these positive developments as limited and at times occurring in spite of the government, not because of embraced reforms. The international press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, for example, ranked Egypt as 127th out of 178 countries for press freedom in 2010. "Since taking power in 1981, Hosni Mubarak has gone all out to curb not just press freedom but also citizens' rights to freedom of information. The authorities have for several years been tightening control over the Internet, but without excessive use of filtering," the group reported. Freedom House, a nonprofit that monitors democratic freedoms around the world, noted that "Restrictions on press freedom continued in 2009, as Egyptian reporters tested the boundaries of acceptable coverage but were confronted by arrests, lawsuits and state-sponsored assaults." "The Egyptian blogosphere remains extremely lively, with a large range of opinions freely expressed online and a wide breadth of content available to users of the medium. In response, the government has continued to harass and intimidate those who publish online," the report added. In 2009, the Committee to Protect Journalists listed Egypt as one of the 10 worst countries for bloggers. "Authorities regularly detain critical bloggers for open-ended periods. Local press freedom groups documented the detention of more than 100 bloggers in 2008 alone," the committee said in its release. Human Rights Watch noted widespread instances of police brutality in a 2011 report. "Police and security forces regularly engaged in torture in police stations, detention centers, and at points of arrest," the report said. There also were restrictions on freedom of religion. "Although Egypt's constitution provides for equal rights without regard to religion, there is widespread discrimination against Egyptian Christians, as well as official intolerance of heterodox Muslim sects," the report said. Diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks show that U.S. State Department officials were equally down on Egypt's human rights record. "Police brutality in Egypt against common criminals is routine and pervasive," said a 2009 report from the U.S. embassy in Cairo. "Contacts describe the police using force to extract confessions from criminals as a daily event, resulting from poor training and understaffing." A cable from 2008 reported, "Our fundamental political reform goal in Egypt remains democratic transformation, including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, respect for human rights, and a stable and legitimate transition to the post-Mubarak era. Egyptian democracy and human rights efforts, however, are being suffocated ...Mubarak now makes scant public pretense of advancing a vision for democratic change. An ongoing challenge remains balancing our security interests with our democracy promotion efforts." Experts we spoke with had similar comments. Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told us he saw the ambassador's comments on This Week and thought they were "deeply misleading and inaccurate." "The level of human rights abuses and restrictions on political space have not significantly changed over the past decades, and this stagnation and the daily humiliations that come with it are at the very core of the popular revolt we are seeing today," Bouckaert said via e-mail. "There are two separate realities in Egypt. That seen by the tourists and the ruling elite and that experienced by ordinary Egyptians. The ambassador was doubtlessly hoping that his audience was only familiar with the former." We got a concise but telling reply from Steven Cook, a fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "He's a 'bs-er.' You can quote me," Cook said via e-mail. Michael Collins Dunn, editor of The Middle East Journal, said political freedoms might be a little better than they were 20 years ago, particularly in regard to press freedom. But looking at the government, political opposition remains weak, and Mubarak's ruling party has firm control of the government. "If you're talking about genuine progress to a multiparty democracy, you have to look long and hard," Dunn said. Finally, we should note that Amanpour told the ambassador that the Egyptians protesting in the street didn't seem to agree with his statements. "As I say, they are saying that what's happening is not enough," she said. "What more should the government do to bring more freedom, political pluralism? There is no meaningful political space here." In our ruling, we find little to support the ambassador's statement that "Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard." A few things may have improved, particularly in the area of press freedom, but they are hardly "great strides." In fact, the government continues to arrest journalists, police brutality is widespread, and the ruling party maintains firm control. We rate the ambassador's statement False.

pomt-05426	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget "calls for raising property taxes by nearly $500 billion."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/30/pat-quinn/illinois-gov-pat-quinn-says-gov-scott-walkers-budg/	From his earliest days in office, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has used Wisconsin’s southerly neighbor as a punching bag, hitting Illinois for trying to tax its way out of a big deficit. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn volleyed back when Walker crossed the border for an April 17, 2012 speech in Springfield to tout his record -- and troll for businesses looking to relocate -- at the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. In a campaign fundraising email, Quinn bashed Wisconsin’s last-in-the nation record on job creation in 2011 and tried to poke holes in Walker’s record on taxes. "You might have heard that the Illinois Chamber of Commerce hosted Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker as guest speaker today," the email said. "One would wonder what a governor with a terrible economic record could have to say about jobs and economic growth. While Governor Walker might be fond of anti-worker and tea party rhetoric, the facts aren't on his side." Quinn’s hit list ended with this: "Governor Walker's budget increases state spending by over $1 billion, which is primarily paid for by tax increases on seniors, families with children, and home owners. His budget calls for raising property taxes by nearly … $500 billion." In an earlier item we confirmed that Walker signed a two-year budget that raised spending by more than $1 billion, a 1.8% increase over the biennium. Most of the increase was in Medicaid programs, which are entitlements. But did the budget lead to $500 billion in property tax increases? Hasn’t Walker been touting a property tax freeze? Right out of the gate we found a problem with Quinn’s number. The day after Quinn’s email, we asked his campaign about the figure. Five days later we were told it was a typo that was being corrected. They meant $500 million, not billion. By that time, the higher figure has been reprinted in a Rockford newspaper editorial and on political blogs in both states. Scott Belsky, executive director of Quinn’s campaign organization, subsequently told us the exact figure they are referring to is $483.8 million. The figure, he said, is from Walker’s cut in two tax credits for low-income homeowners and working families, plus "increasing taxes on local levels of government." Sure enough, that number or something close to it was cited by various Democrats after Walker signed the budget in June 2011. They did their math using estimates published in July 2011 by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper. That’s a great source, but the Fiscal Bureau report didn’t actually use the $483.8 million number in estimating the total property tax increase for two years. Fiscal Bureau official Rick Olin said their estimate is better stated as $338 million -- that comes from a comparison of estimated 2012 tax levies with the pre-Walker base year of 2010. Going for the worst-sounding math (just as Republicans have done in the past), Democrats took the estimates for each of the two Walker years and compared them to the 2010 base. "Nobody thinks about it that way," said Olin, a fiscal analyst on property taxes. What about the two tax credits Quinn’s campaign cites? One was for income taxes, so that’s irrelevant to his claim on property taxes. The other Walker change, on the Homestead credit, did in effect raise property taxes by $13.6 million, state fiscal estimates show. So take the $338 million and the $13.6 million and you’re at more than a $350 million increase predicted under Walker’s budget. But there’s a much bigger problem for Quinn. The numbers were Fiscal Bureau estimates from about nine months ago. On April 16, 2012, the day before Quinn’s campaign rolled out the unwelcome mat for Walker, the Wisconsin governor announced hard data on what local governments actually raised property taxes. The net levy increase was $21 million (0.2 percent) in year one -- far, far lower than the Fiscal Bureau projection. Indeed, the owner of a median-valued home actually saw a slight decrease on the property tax bill. A big reason was the tightened revenue caps Walker and GOP legislators slapped on localities -- creating a virtual tax freeze, with an exception increases tied to new construction. Fewer communities than expected used even the little wiggle room Walker gave them. So, while Quinn’s email blamed Walker for property tax decisions made by local officials, the record shows Walker actually sought aggressive controls on local increases. Our rating Quinn said his Wisconsin counterpart had increased property taxes nearly $500 billion. That was explained as an old-fashioned typo. But even then, the $500 million is way off. When Walker signed the budget in June 2011, property taxes were estimated to go up $350 million under the most common accounting. That estimate held until the April 16, 2012 report -- and it seems likely Quinn’s email was prepared before Walker’s announcement changed the game. But he didn’t correct the million/billion typo in a timely way, and is still using the equally wrong $500 million claim. We think that’s ridiculous. And that makes this a Pants on Fire!

pomt-05787	One estimate says there may be "three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-us-may-have-three-times-much-oi/	In a 30-minute speech that’s running on television as a campaign ad in selected primary states, Newt Gingrich suggests the United States is awash in oil. "Turns out, we may have more oil in the United States today, given new science and new technology, than we have actually pumped worldwide since 1870," Gingrich says. "We may, in fact, by one estimate, have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia." For this item, we’ll be looking at the latter claim -- that one estimate says the U.S. may have "three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia." The Gingrich campaign did not tell us which report the candidate was citing, but we found one study that made a comparison that’s almost identical to what Gingrich said. However, Gingrich does not make the comparison accurately. The 2005 report by the RAND Corp., an independent think tank, is titled, "Oil Shale Development in the United States Prospects and Policy Issues." It focuses on oil shale -- sedimentary rocks that release petroleum-like liquids when heated. (Oil shale is different, and more technically difficult to recover, than the "tight oil" being aggressively extracted today in North Dakota, which requires modern drilling and recovery techniques but not heating.) Here’s the comparison from the report that echoes what Gingrich said: "The United States contains massive amounts of oil held in mineral deposits known as oil shale, located primarily in the states of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. The recoverable energy from these high-grade deposits may be more than 800 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent — more than triple the known oil reserves of Saudi Arabia." (The RAND report offered a range of 500 billion barrels to 1.1 trillion barrels, of which 800 billion was roughly the midpoint estimate.) That sounds pretty similar, but we should note a couple of important caveats. Shale oil isn’t yet ready for the taking In an earlier PolitiFact item on this subject, we noted a Congressional Research Service report that offered some broad principles for judging how easy or hard it is to extract natural resources. "It is important to keep in mind that naturally occurring deposits of any material, whether it is fossil fuels, gold, or timber, comprise a broad spectrum of concentration, quality, and accessibility (geologic, technical, and cultural)," CRS wrote. The report’s authors suggested visualizing this notion as a pyramid -- a small amount of easily recoverable resources at the top, with increasingly large deposits that are more and more difficult to extract toward the base of the pyramid. Oil shale is somewhere toward the bottom of the pyramid, making it more susceptible to technological and cost concerns. The RAND report’s lead author, James T. Bartis, told us it's difficult and costly to extract the oil from shale because "the heating process is expensive, since the temperature needs to be raised to over 650 degrees Fahrenheit, as compared to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit for the Canadian tar sands," another non-traditional source that’s been expanding rapidly in recent years. "At this time, no firm with the technical, management, and financial resources needed to develop this resource has stepped forward and stated that they are prepared to build a commercial production facility, though such firms, and others, are actively engaged in developing the necessary technology." The comparison isn’t apples to apples The U.S. side of the comparison is based on "potentially recoverable reserves," whereas the Saudi side of the comparison is based on "proven reserves." Those are two very different measures. "Proven reserves," according to CRS, refers to estimates made with "reasonable certainty" to be "commercially recoverable" under current economic and governmental conditions. According to data from the Energy Information Adminstration, a federal agency, Saudi Arabia has 13 times the amount of proven reserves as the U.S. does. These numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt, due to imperfect estimation techniques and old or unreliable data. (Countries, for instance, have an incentive to exaggerate their holdings.) Still, at least this comparison is as close as one gets to apples to apples in the petroleum estimation business. Assuming one uses a consistent methodology, it would also be valid to compare potentially recoverable reserves in both nations, although the numbers available are even more speculative than they are for proven reserves, especially for the Saudi side of the equation. "I have no basis for estimating Saudi Arabia’s potentially recoverable resource base," Bartis said. The estimate of potentially recoverable resources in the U.S. is also subject to some debate. CRS, for instance, said that "the uncertainty associated with estimates of those deposits is too great to produce meaningful comparisons. … The final tally would have very little meaning considering the difficulties in estimating those resources." Also unknown is how much of an environmental cost there would be to extraction, or how much government investment would be necessary if the industry considered it uneconomical on its own terms. The RAND report explicitly did not factor in economics when making its estimates because shale has never been profitable, which confounds attempts to quantify how much is there. The report assumed that in time, techniques will be developed that would allow 60 percent of the embedded resource to be extracted. Not considering economic feasibility leads some to question whether the RAND paper’s assumptions are too generous. However, the more important factor as we judge Gingrich’s comparison is that he seemed to compare potentially recoverable reserves to proven reserves -- a comparison that’s apples to oranges. "I think it would be most accurate to compare all of our probable reserves including our oil shale and heavy oil as compared to Saudi Arabia's proven and probable reserves," said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. While the RAND report did pair U.S. potentially recoverable reserves with just Saudi proven reserves -- not probable ones -- Bartis said that he and his co-authors did so simply to provide a sense of scale of how big the U.S. shale oil reservoir was -- not to make an actual comparison between how much each country had, as Gingrich did. Bartis said he made the analogy "to help our readers grasp the magnitude of the oil shale resources in the U.S. But that doesn’t mean that the U.S. has three times the oil" of Saudi Arabia. Our ruling Gingrich said that the United States "may, in fact, by one estimate, have three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia." A paper, published by a respected think tank, does make a similar comparison, but it does not go so far as to suggest that the U.S. may actually have "three times as much oil as Saudi Arabia." The paper’s author told PolitiFact that such a leap is invalid since the comparison does not use apples-to-apples statistics. The U.S. figure is an estimate of what may be theoretically recoverable without looking at economic viability, while the Saudi number is an estimate made with at least some consideration of the economics of recovery. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ce4ffa7c-649c-4571-b659-f777b90e0724	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-02-24T18:31:16	2012-02-22	['United_States', 'Saudi_Arabia']

pomt-11022	"By law, Democrats gave the superintendent of public instruction, back in 2009, the ability to take over failing schools … The current superintendent has failed to do that."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/05/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-state-schools-chief-tony-eve/	Have the problems facing Milwaukee Public Schools reached a point where the state should step in? They have in the eyes of Gov. Scott Walker, who said Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers has failed to step up. Evers, not so coincidentally, is one of the many Democrats aiming to take on Walker in the November 2018 election. In an extended interview portion of WISN-TV’s May 13, 2018, episode of "UpFront with Mike Gousha," Walker left open the possibility of changing district boundaries and breaking MPS into smaller sections as "things we realistically have to look at." After Gousha asked if the state has a responsibility to step in with MPS, Walker replied: By law, Democrats gave the superintendent of public instruction, back in 2009, the ability to take over failing schools. And for whatever reason the current superintendent has failed to do that … Maybe we have to look beyond that. If the superintendent is not willing to do that, then I think then maybe there are other things we need to look at. Maybe we shake things up a little bit. Is Walker right about Evers ignoring his ability to take over Milwaukee schools? The background When asked for backup to the claim, Walker spokeswoman Amy Hasenberg cited Wisconsin State Statute 118.42. The statute -- with the heading "Low-performing school districts and schools; state superintendent interventions" -- provides a list of scenarios under which the state schools superintendent can intervene in low-performing school districts and schools. The first part of the statute addresses what can happen to districts found to be in need of improvement for four consecutive school years: (a) Employ a standard, consistent, research-based curriculum that is aligned with the state's model academic standards, as determined by the state superintendent, and across grades in all schools. (b) Use pupil academic performance data, including data indicating improvement in pupil academic achievement and English language acquisition, to differentiate instruction to meet individual pupil needs. To the extent practicable, the school board shall assess pupils in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data. (c) Implement for all pupils a system of academic and behavioral supports and early interventions, including diagnostic assessments, instruction in core academic subjects, different instructional strategies for different pupils, and strategies to improve reading and mathematics instruction and promote positive behavior. (d) Provide additional learning time to address the academic needs of pupils who are struggling academically, including pupils whose proficiency in English is limited. The additional learning time may include an extended school day, an extended school year, summer school, or intersession courses. How it works in practice Department of Public Instruction spokesman Tom McCarthy told the Wisconsin State Journal in an article posted May 14, 2018, the department has never considered a "takeover" of Milwaukee schools because "how schools are governed or run isn’t going to change the challenges kids in Milwaukee face." In an email, McCarthy told us "not only is the governor mischaracterizing how 118.42 works, he's also incorrect in whether it can be currently used to intervene with MPS." McCarthy went on to say: The superintendent powers have a trigger for use (based on the performance of a district/school) and allowable interventions. The allowable interventions do not allow the superintendent to "take over a school," but do allow for specific turn-around strategies to be required. Taking over a school, as we have historically known and used the phrase, means assuming all decision-making power. The superintendent powers do not permit that and no such power exists in 118.42. Meanwhile, an analyst at the state’s Legislative Reference Bureau referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Wisconsin Legislative Council memo for statute 118.42. The memo includes criteria "authorizing the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to intervene with the school district under certain conditions." But it contains no reference to the superintendent having the authority to take over failing schools. What’s more, McCarthy noted MPS no longer qualifies for these permitted interventions. The law’s trigger is based on performance on the school/district report card and whether that district has fallen into the bottom category. MPS -- having moved out of the bottom category -- no longer qualifies. A separate program In our interview with McCarthy, he did note there is a takeover provision in state law . Though it operates differently: "It does exist in the Opportunity Schools Partnership Program," he said. "In that scenario, the takeover authority is vested in the county executive and the commissioner. Not the state superintendent." Under that program, known as OSPP, the department of public instruction identifies districts that would qualify for the program due to performance triggers spelled out by the law, and notifies the county executive in the county that is home to the district "The county executive appoints a commissioner and that person then has the ability to take over a school, provided they are on the list of low-performing schools within the district," said McCarthy. "Again, no authority for (DPI) exists in the OSPP beyond simple identification." In November 2015, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele selected Demond Means, superintendent of the Mequon-Thiensville School District, as the special commissioner. By late July 2016, Means had resigned, saying the adversarial climate surrounding the program "is the last thing our children need." Means was given a list of schools that qualified for takeover. The following school year, 2016-’17, those schools determined to be eligible could be taken over, but Means did not take over any schools. In 2017-'18, the just-concluded year, no schools were eligible for takeover. Alan Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School and weekly columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, said the state superintendent does have options. "The superintendent has strong options to seek change under that state law and had other options under the now-gone federal No Child Left Behind law, but they didn’t rise to what I would label taking over schools," Borsuk told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said "Democrats gave the superintendent of public instruction, back in 2009, the ability to take over failing schools. … The current superintendent has failed to do that." While the law in questions allows the superintendent to order various interventions, it does not have a provision for a complete takeover. A different law allows the local county executive to take action. That process was begun in Milwaukee, but did not advance. In addition, MPS no longer falls into the bottom category of the state's school and district report cards, and therefore no longer qualifies for the interventions under the state law.

pomt-11739	Says Russian President Vladimir Putin got a standing ovation from the Duma after he gave a speech saying Muslims are "taking over" other countries but won't take over Russia.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/11/chain-email/chain-email-putin-says-minorities-should-adopt-rus/	A fake speech with explosive language attributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin is being circulated via email chains. The email said that in a speech addressed to the Duma, the Russian legislative body, Putin said, "Russia does not need Muslim minorities," and that minorities, specifically Muslims, living in Russia should accommodate to Russian culture or leave. The email said Putin received a five minute standing ovation at the end of his speech. Here’s what the email claimed was the text of Putin’s speech: "In Russia, (we) live like Russians. Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, it should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims, then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture. We better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland, and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture, or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim Minorities are not Russians.’ ... Snopes fact-checked a similar email in 2015, finding it false; however, this fake news is still spreading. and we wanted to address it. Snopes found a speech that Putin gave to the Board of the Federal Migration Service in January 2012 in which Putin talked about the integration of immigrants into Russian society and respect for Russian culture. But it did not have nearly as aggressive a tone that the language in the email has. Putin’s actual words were far more moderate, though he did support requiring immigrants to learn Russian. "On the whole, the adaptation of guest workers is a separate and comprehensive issue. We must create the conditions for immigrants to normally integrate into our society, learn Russian and, of course, respect our culture and traditions and abide by Russian law. In this regard, I believe that the decision to make learning the Russian language compulsory and administer exams is well grounded," said Putin in the speech to the Board of Federal Migration Service. We failed to find any other of Putin’s public remarks that matched up with the chain email. Email chains can be misleading, but this fake speech did not happen, nor did the five-minute standing ovation. We rate it as Pants on Fire.

pomt-05802	Says the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency brought coyotes into the state "to try to keep the deer population down."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/23/frank-niceley/house-committee-chairman-claims-state-agency-deliv/	At a hearing on wildlife management laws, members of the House Conservation and Environment Committee turned from discussion of a wild hog eradication program now under way to other animals that can cause problems for people. "Let’s talk about the coyotes," said Rep. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, a member of the committee and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. "The TWRA (Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency) brought the coyotes in here to control the deer herd. Their biologists are not dumb. They knew these deer, in an ideal situation like this, would explode (in population)," he said. "So they brought these coyotes in here to try to keep the deer population down. Now, these coyotes, they will kill calves. … It’s a huge problem. I have 80 head of sheep, and the coyotes got into them and they killed 60 head of sheep before I could get them behind a tight fence. … The coyotes, when they get thick enough, will start getting kids out of the yard." In the past, TWRA has engaged in well-known and successful programs to stock deer and wild turkeys into Tennessee, where native populations were virtually wiped out in the 1800s. But we hadn’t heard about coyote stocking. When initially asked whether TWRA had imported coyotes into the state, where they did not appear until sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s, the agency’s assistant executive director, Nat Johnson, at first had trouble taking the query seriously. "Actually, we sent some officers over to Arkansas and gave them swimming lessons," he said. "After we taught them, coyotes could swim over the Mississippi River." Dropping the sarcasm, Johnson said he did not believe Niceley was correct, but referred the question for a more authoritative answer to Steve Patrick, TWRA’s assistant director of field operations. Patrick, a 35-year veteran of the agency, said his job over the years positioned him to know if TWRA had ever been involved in any coyote relocation and, no, that had never happened. But he said it is a fairly common myth. "That and that we’re releasing rattlesnakes, too," he said, adding that TWRA has never engaged in rattlesnake relocation either. Niceley, advised that TWRA disputed his contention, said he has heard reports of coyote transplants attributed to "early biologists back in the 1970s." Further, he said the agency at least collaborated with a federal project to re-introduce red wolves into Tennessee and "red wolves and coyotes have the same DNA." The latter reference is to an effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, launched in 1991, to establish red wolves in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The effort failed and was abandoned in 1998, according to a news release issued by the federal agencies at the time. Patrick said TWRA was aware of the red wolf project, but had no involvement whatsoever. Few pups from the transplanted red wolves survived. The release says at least one was killed by coyotes. Dr. Michael Kennedy, a professor of biology at the University of Memphis who has done extensive research on coyotes since 1975, including some under contract for TWRA, said that today’s remnant red wolves do share some DNA with coyotes, though "taxonomically, they’re different." Coyotes are also known, on occasion, to interbreed with dogs, he said. But in Tennessee, he said, "about 95 percent of what we have are true coyotes" without any genetic kinship to other canines. His research indicates Tennessee coyotes are genetically the same as those from states to the west and they arrived through "natural dispersal." "There’s no question that the TWRA – or anyone else, for that matter – is not responsible for coyotes moving into Tennessee," he said. Kennedy also says that coyotes are generally not good enough at catching deer to serve as an effective control of deer populations. While they can and do kill fawns and ailing animals, deer are a small part of the average coyote’s diverse diet, he said. Coyotes, once confined to the western states, have spread into all states east of the Mississippi. And apparently the notion of them being introduced by wildlife agencies is not unique to Tennessee. The Pennsylvania Game Commission, in fact, was concerned enough to include a denial of stocking in an article about coyotes on its website. "Some folks actually believe the agency has stocked coyotes in recent years to reduce deer numbers. Nothing could be further from the truth," says the article. Our ruling In relying on an unsubstantiated urban myth (or shall we say a "rural myth" in this case?) Niceley broke what should be a cardinal rule of public speaking -- make sure there is some shred of truth to a claim you are making. This one has been debunked before elsewhere and deserves to be again. When questioned, Niceley fell back to the history of red wolves, but even that displayed a misunderstanding of what actually was a federal program that experts said was unsuccessful. Niceley’s statement is definitely a real howler -- Pants On Fire.	None	Frank Niceley	None	None	None	2012-02-23T08:29:34	2012-02-01	['None']

pomt-08384	Says Marco Rubio said that "people who essentially don't agree with him, ought to leave the country, like Keith Olbermann."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-marco-rubio-has-said-people-who/	Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, an independent candidate for U.S. Senate, defends his departure from the Republican Party by criticizing the "extreme views" held by the GOP’s right wing — and by extension his Republican rival, Marco Rubio. So on Oct. 24, 2010, in their fifth debate of the campaign, Crist strove to paint Rubio as a rigid idealogue who wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade and didn’t support stem cell research. Then he turned it up a notch, saying Rubio had said that folks who didn’t agree with him ought to leave the country. "You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with," Crist said. "(Rubio) took it to a point so much so that (he) said that, you know, people who essentially don't agree with him, ought to leave the country, like Keith Olbermann." Could it be true? Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner pointed us to a Palm Beach Post story from March 2010 about a Rubio campaign stop in West Palm Beach. The story ended this way: Rubio also said he was against amnesty for immigrants, believing legal immigration will never work if illegal immigrants are granted amnesty. Then, he closed the speech with a thought he said originated from Glenn Beck, FOX News' popular conservative talk show host. "There are millions of people in America that hate our country, so why can't we just do a trade?" Rubio said. "We'll send you Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo and Keith Olbermann, and you can send us people that actually love this country and want to help us build it." The story prompted this impassioned response from the MSNBC host: "You have inadvertently revealed that you don't see those with other viewpoints as merely disagreeing with you. You have inadvertently revealed that you dismiss them as not loving this country." Sunday morning, Rubio’s campaign didn’t flinch. Spokesman Alex Burgos offered this quick response from his BlackBerry after the debate: "It's true what Marco said, and we appreciate the governor bringing it up." Given the evidence, and both sides’ endorsement of it, we rate Crist’s statement True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-10-24T17:15:19	2010-10-24	['Marco_Rubio', 'Keith_Olbermann']

pomt-07345	The "six largest cities in Ohio all have higher rates of violence and crime than every major city along the U.S.-Mexico border."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/10/silvestre-reyes/silvestre-reyes-says-ohios-most-populous-cities-ha/	U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, teed off on House Speaker John Boehner by comparing cities in Boehner’s home state of Ohio to communities along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Monday, the day before President Barack Obama’s swing through El Paso and Austin, Reyes first noted a comment by the Republican speaker’s spokesman, Michael Steel. Steel said last week that before Congress takes up immigration policy, the priority "must be ending the violence at the border — we really can’t deal with other issues until it is secure." His comment appeared in the May 3 issue of Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper. Boehner, Reyes said in a press release, "should focus on controlling the level of violence in his own state before tarnishing the image of border communities that remain among the safest places to live in America. ... The fact remains that the six largest cities in Ohio all have higher rates of violence and crime than every major city along the U.S.-Mexico border." Whoa. Do the Buckeye State’s largest cities have more violence and crime? Looks like it. As backup, Reyes cited research compiled by CQ Press, which said in a November 2010 press release that its latest compilation of city-by-city crime information reflects data for cities of at least 75,000 residents that reported crime data to the FBI for its Uniform Crime Reporting Program as of September 2010. In 2009, over all, Ohio’s six most populous cities—Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron and Dayton—had higher crime rates than six border cities: San Diego, El Paso, Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen and Yuma, Arizona. The best-rated Ohio city, Columbus, was 49th, the worst-rated border city, Laredo, was 144th, according to CQ Press. We verified the population of each of the dozen cities with the U.S. Census Bureau. Its 2010 counts suggest the average population of the Ohio cities was nearly 363,000 while the average population of the border cities was a little more than 447,000. According to CQ Press’s report, the six Ohio cities had higher rates of murder, rape, robbery and burglary than the six border cities. For murder, specifically, the Ohio cities’ rates ranged from Dayton’s 25.5 per 100,000 residents down to Akron’s 9.7 per 100,000 residents. Among the border burgs, Laredo had the highest rate, 7.5 murders per 100,000 residents, El Paso had the lowest, 1.9. In two crime categories, though, there are wrinkles unfavorable to the border. Yuma had nearly 501 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents, second among all the checked cities to Toledo, Ohio, which had 629 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents. Four Ohio cities had higher rates than the other border cities, though Columbus, with nearly 170 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents, had a lower rate than any border cities except Brownsville and McAllen. For motor vehicle theft, Cleveland topped the reviewed cities with 939 per 100,000 residents. Laredo placed second, though, with nearly 654 per 100,000 residents and San Diego was third, with 570 per 100,000 residents. Next, the five other most populous Ohio cities had greater motor vehicle theft rates than Yuma, Arizona or McAllen. El Paso, 305 per 100,000 residents, and Brownsville, 188 per 100,000 residents, had the lowest rates of motor vehicle theft. Summing up: The six largest Ohio cities had higher overall crime rates and rates of murder, rape, robbery and burglary than the six major border cities. Yet a border city had a higher rate of aggravated assaults than four Ohio cities while the rate for Columbus was higher than the rate in two border cities. Also, all but one of the Ohio cities had lower rates of motor vehicle theft than Laredo. We rate the statement Mostly True. CORRECTION, 10:25 a.m., May 11, 2011: The day this article posted, we subsequently amended our reference to the 2009 rate of aggravated assaults in Columbus. The initial article incorrectly said the Ohio city had the lowest rate of all the checked cities. In addition, the article's conclusion was later amended to correct the Columbus reference.

pomt-13534	As the number of vaccines administered to children has increased in the United States, so has the autism rate.	false	/ohio/statements/2016/aug/29/viral-image/viral-image-perpetuates-misconception-vaccines-cau/	A viral image from the website NaturalNews.com is bouncing along through the echo chamber of Facebook. It suggests a connection between the number of vaccines given to babies in the United States over time, and an increase in people diagnosed with autism. Health memes like this are common on social media, and this particular image’s source, NaturalNews.com, encourages its community to spread the message. The site brands itself as "the world’s top news source on natural health." Its founder, entrepreneur Mike Adams, calls himself the "Health Ranger." To vet this claim of causality between vaccines and autism, we consulted Dennis Cunningham, an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Ohio State University. He is on the physician team on infectious diseases at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. What we found is that the number of autism diagnoses has risen in the past decade, but scientists aren't sure if that represents a true increase in cases or a change in diagnosis. Scientists and experts say the rise in cases, however, is not related to the number of vaccines children are receiving. Small change in vaccines The meme says the number of vaccinations has grown from 10 in 1983 to 46 in 2013. Both numbers are vastly inflated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2013 immunization schedule only lists 10 vaccines recommended for babies up to 24 months of age. "We’re not really up to 46 vaccines," Cunningham said. "They may be including vaccines administered in multiple doses, like for measles, mumps and rubella. If they are counting every time a child gets a shot as a ‘vaccine,’ I’m not sure that’s an accurate way to count." PolitiFact Ohio attempted to contact NaturalNews through a form on the website but received no response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines a vaccine as "a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease." One vaccine can require more than one shot to achieve the best protection. The mumps, measles and rubella vaccine (MMR), for example, prevents all three diseases. It requires two shots, one at 12 to 15 months and one at four to six years of age. Though it is designed to protect against three diseases, and is administered in two shots, the MMR vaccine is treated as one vaccine. Ian Branam, a communications specialist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told PolitiFact Ohio that vaccines sometimes require more than one shot "to build high enough immunity to prevent disease, boost immunity that fades over time, help to make sure people who did not get immunity from a first dose are protected, or protect against germs that change over time, such as flu." For all years, the viral image overstates the number of vaccines recommended for children. The meme says that there were 10 vaccines administered to babies in 1983. Branam gave us the official count: only three vaccines were recommended for babies under two years of age that year. The meme says that the number of recommended vaccines for babies increased to 36 by 2008. Branam corrected that number to 10 -- the same number in 2013. Rise in autism According to NaturalNews’ viral image, the rate of autism has risen from 1 in 10,000 in 1983, to 1 in 150 in 2008, to 1 in 88 in 2013. The viral image’s figures on the prevalence of autism over time are inconsistent with CDC research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first report on autism in 2007, and quantified its prevalence as 1 in 150. The most recent report said autism affects 1 in 68 children in 2016. The rise in the rate of the disorder is proportional to the increase in scientific and medical attention it has received, according to epidemiologist Michael Rosanoff. Rosanoff is the director of Autism Speaks, the largest autism advocacy group in the country. The numbers "suggest that we’ve gotten better at identifying autism in the United States," Rosanoff said. "Ten years ago – when the CDC first started autism surveillance -- the reported prevalence was 1 in 150. We have reason to believe that much of the increase since then is due to improved detection." Put another way, Rosanoff says it’s not necessarily that more children have autism today, it’s that we are better at identifying it. Breaking the link between vaccines and autism rates NaturalNews’ viral image illustrates two phenomenons -- vaccines given to children, and rates of autism -- stair-stepping upward together over time. But Cunningham, with the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, told PolitiFact Ohio that the relationship is spurious. Autism rates have been going up, said Cunningham. That's partly because the criteria for the diagnosis has widened, encompassing children that would not have been considered autistic when the disease was in earlier phases of detection, he said. Moreover, NaturalNews "is ignoring the multiple articles in medical literature that show no association between autism and vaccinations," Cunningham said. (PolitiFact previously has addressed this question in regards to the Measles vaccine, with scientists saying there is no connection between the vaccine and autism.) Concerns over thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that was used in some vaccines, sparked the original vaccine scare. Cunningham said thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is quickly broken down and eliminated by the body. Methylmercury, on the other hand, can build up in cells and tissues over time, to poisonous levels. Though the harm that some feared was based on confusion between the forms of mercury, Cunningham said, thimerosal was nonetheless removed from most vaccines in 2001. "I was one of the doctors who did not agree with taking it out, because it was not done for a scientific reason," Cunningham said. "Since then, there has been no impact on the rates of autism." On its website, the Autism Science Foundation features a statement regarding autism and vaccines. "We’ve asked the autism vaccine question over two dozen times and each time we get the same response: no relationship," it says. "We need to move on. We need to invest in studying genetics, the brain structures of children with autism, and environmental factors that may be playing a role." Cunningham added, "Parents absolutely have the right to make decisions for their children, but I get concerned when they move away from science and evidence-based medicine to an emotion-based response. I have seen kids die in the hospital from vaccine-preventable diseases." Our ruling A viral meme from NaturalNews.com uses dates, rising numbers in vaccines given to babies, and rising rates of autism to suggest a relationship between vaccines and autism. The meme is inflating the number of vaccines, which stood at 10 in 2008 and 2013, according to the CDC. Meanwhile, the rate of children diagnosed with autism is increasing, though the numbers NaturalNews.com offered are not entirely accurate. The problem with this claim, however, is putting the two numbers together to lead people to believe that vaccines are causing the increase in autism rates. A pediatrician and specialist in infectious diseases said that any connection between vaccines (with or without thimerosal) and autism has been thoroughly dismissed through more than two dozen peer-reviewed studies. We rate this claim False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/50ccc4f4-1434-44db-92b6-620e27d8f85b	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-08-29T16:45:00	2016-08-29	['United_States']
pomt-09920	Says the Congressional Budget Office estimates a cap-and-trade program would cost the average family the equivalent of "a postage stamp a day."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/25/edward-markey/claims-cbo-predicts-cap-and-trade-will-cost-about-/	Responding to Republicans who have said a cap-and-trade bill could cost thousands of dollars a year for the average family, the Democratic sponsors of the bill are citing a new study from the Congressional Budget Office that they say shows their plan will be affordable. "For the cost of about a postage stamp a day, all American families will see a return on their investment as our nation breaks our dependence on foreign oil, cuts dangerous carbon pollution and creates millions of new clean-energy jobs that can't be shipped overseas," Rep. Edward Markey said in a June 22, 2009, news release jointly issued with the co-sponsor, Rep. Henry Waxman. Waxman and Markey, from California and Massachusetts respectively, are the authors of a bill that would set up a market for power companies and other polluters to buy and trade carbon credits. The goal is to force them to cut their harmful emissions and lower carbon pollution 83 percent by 2050. But critics say polluters will inevitably pass the cost of buying credits or cleaner technologies on to the consumer. Putting a price tag on such a complex plan is tricky and controversial, as we note in our article Your Guide to the Cap-and-Trade Estimates . The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, says that cap-and-trade could raise the average family's annual energy bill by $1,241. House Republicans have said that cap-and-trade could cost consumers up to $3,100, a figure they say came from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report. But the writers of that report admonished the GOP for incorrectly interpreting their work; intially, the authors predicted it would cost consumers about $340 annually, and have since updated that estimate to $800. Waxman and Markey are relying on a June 19 Congressional Budget Office analysis of their bill. The CBO is a well-respected, independent arm of Congress, but we have found its findings are occasionally mischaracterized by members of Congress. So we wanted to check whether Waxman is correctly summarizing the CBO's findings. Indeed, the report cited by Markey and Waxman predicts the bill would have a net annual economywide cost of $22 billion — or about $175 per household — in 2020. Divide that number by 365 days, and you get about 48 cents. A first-class stamp costs 44 cents, so Waxman is close. The CBO's estimate includes several assumptions about important decisions that still must be made by Congress, such as how much energy companies will pay to buy and trade polluting credits. But it's worth reading the fine print on this one, because CBO notes that the actual cost per family will vary depending on income. For example, low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year, while wealthy people will see a net increase for energy costs of $235 to $340 every year. And the analysis does not include the costs or benefits of other parts of the bill, such as government efforts to quickly develop new technology, wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf in a June 20 blog post. It's also important to note that the costs will vary year to year. As the bill stands, polluting allowances will initially be given away for free. But by 2035, about 70 percent of those allocations will be sold by the government. Supporters of the bill say federal revenue from the program would be used to pay for tax credits and rebates for the middle class. CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more. Waxman and Markey are clear about these variables and omissions in their press statement. They note that the poorest people will gain from the bill, and point out that the study does not include every element that could contribute to cap-and-trade's cost. But critics are more skeptical of the report. By not including all variables, the CBO report "grossly underestimates costs of cap-and-trade," said a memo from the Heritage Foundation, which has published many articles opposing the proposal. Among other things, Heritage says the study is flawed because it doesn't address economic changes resulting from restricted energy use and potential job losses. For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are not addressing which study is best, but focusing on whether Markey correctly described the CBO's findings. He was close — off by just 4 cents — and he indicated it was an approximation because he said "about a postage stamp a day." So we find the statement True.

pomt-03287	Says about NSA data collection: "Every member in both parties who served on the Intelligence Committee voted in favor of this."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/02/tom-cole/rep-tom-cole-says-his-nsa-vote-backed-entire-intel/	Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says he recently voted to keep a controversial National Security Agency data collection program in part because he trusts lawmakers who know it best. "I'm going to go with the people that actually know the program and looked at it," he said. His position had bipartisan support, he explained on MSNBC’s Morning Joe: "Every member in both parties who served on the Intelligence Committee voted in favor of this." Did every Republican and Democrat privy to the committee’s classified briefings vote to keep the NSA program? Section 215 of the Patriot Act Lawmakers recently targeted the scope of the program authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which was thrown under bright lights by leaks in June from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. A secret court order published by the Guardian showed the government routinely collects metadata about Americans’ phone calls — such as phone numbers and times and lengths of conversations. (The administration says such data is only accessed under strict guidelines.) That was news to some lawmakers who assumed a narrower interpretation of U.S. Code that had been amended by Section 215. It allows for collection of records relevant to investigations of foreigners. Who would have thought that included data for every single domestic call placed by some major American communications companies? So last week, House lawmakers voted on two proposed amendments to a defense spending bill that sought to clarify or curtail the government’s use of Section 215. (The Senate's also considering measures to limit the program.) The Pompeo amendment, sponsored by an Intelligence Committee member, clarified no funds could be used by the NSA to store the content of a U.S. person’s electronic communications, but left the metadata program in place. It passed 409-12. The Amash amendment, which got more attention, refused funding to carry out any court order that didn’t restrict records collection to just those "that pertain to a person who is the subject of an investigation." One opponent called it "an on/off switch for Section 215 of the Patriot Act." It failed, 205-217. Cole explained his position on Morning Joe on July 30 — though he didn’t name the amendment he was talking about. "This is a debate worth having," he said. "It's an important debate, and it's not particularly a partisan debate. You know, the majority of Democrats actually voted with Rand Paul on this issue and against Barack Obama and their own leadership in the House. So the majority of Republicans actually supported the president's position." Host Joe Scarborough asked: "How did you vote on this one?" Cole replied: "I voted in favor of keeping the NSA program. I think we're going to review it and change it probably. But this would have ended it. And you're talking about — you know, we've stopped over 50 attacks. Every member in both parties who served on the Intelligence Committee voted in favor of this." We assumed Cole was talking about the Amash amendment, and that he interpreted the votes against that amendment as de facto votes for the NSA program. Cole's' office, however, claimed he was talking about the Pompeo amendment. But that doesn't entirely make sense. Cole said the vote in question would "have ended" the NSA program, and the Pompeo amendment didn't do that. So how did the 21 members of the House Intelligence Committee vote? Every one of them supported the Pompeo amendment, which didn’t end bulk metadata collection, same as Cole. Almost every one of them opposed the Amash amendment, which would have removed funding for bulk metadata collection. (In this case a "no" vote functioned as a vote "in favor of keeping the NSA program.") Cole’s "no" vote wasn’t shared by Rep. Ed Pastor, an Arizona Democrat. Pastor, an influential member of the House’s Progressive Caucus who generally stays out of the national news, didn’t speak out on the House floor, and declined to explain his vote to us. "Mr. Pastor confirms that the roll call is accurate. He declined further comment," his spokeswoman said. His vote was the committee’s sole "yes," among nine Democrats and 12 Republicans. Our ruling Cole told Morning Joe that when it comes to the NSA program, he’s going to vote with "the people that actually know." He said his support was shared by every member of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican or Democrat. He was close. One Arizona Democrat disagreed. We find his statement only Mostly True.

pomt-05278	Lloyd Doggett "made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/25/sylvia-romo/sylvia-romo-says-lloyd-doggett-made-millions-compa/	U.S. House candidate Sylvia Romo depicts Lloyd Doggett, the Austin congressman facing Romo and Maria Luisa Alvarado in the Democratic primary, as a cane-carrying "Lloydopoly" (as in Monopoly) character in a mailer brought to our attention by a San Marcos reader. The mailer from Romo, the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, says: "While in Congress, Lloyd Doggett made millions. He made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money and foreclosed on our homes." Doggett, initially elected to the House in 1994, had a net worth of as much as $8.3 million in 2010, according to a look by the Center for Responsive Politics at the personal financial statement he filed for that year. We are focusing this review on Romo’s statement that Doggett made millions off companies like Bank of America while they fielded bailout money. After asking her campaign for backup, we checked news accounts about Bank of America and the bailout. Bank of America received $45 billion in aid through the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program set up in the wake of the 2008 banking panic, according to a Dec. 3, 2009, New York Times news article, though the story said it had just announced it would repay the money. That evidently occurred. A Jan. 26, 2012, news article by the Associated Press says the government by then had unwound its investments in four of the companies that received the most bailout aid: Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Chrysler Group LLC and Chrysler Financial, the automobile maker's old lending arm. Yet, the AP story says, a report by a special inspector general indicated American taxpayers were still owed about $133 billion that companies had not repaid from $413.4 billion paid out in the bailout program. The story says the gyrating stock market had slowed Treasury Department efforts to sell off stakes in 458 bailed-out companies, including insurer American International Group Inc., General Motors Co. and Ally Financial Inc. We asked Doggett’s campaign if he’d profited from Bank of America holdings. His spokeswoman, Ashley Bliss-Herrera, pointed out Doggett's personal financial disclosure statements for 2008 and 2009, the years of the bailout. Those filings, posted online by the Center for Responsive Politics, require lawmakers to report assets and liabilities within broad dollar ranges. Doggett’s filings indicate that in 2008 and in 2009, Doggett had $1,001 to $15,000 invested in Bank of America. He received dividends of $1,001 to $2,500 in 2008 and of up to $200 in 2009, his report says. In 2010, the year of Doggett’s most recently filed report, he had $1,001 to $15,000 invested in Bank of America and up to $200 in related dividends. That year, he had greater amounts invested in more than 60 other entities. Next, again based on his financial disclosure filings, we looked into whether Doggett bagged millions from investments in other major bailout beneficiaries. The investments we spotted, counting the proceeds from his Bank of America holdings, appear to have generated about $16,000 for him from 2008 through 2010. Some details: --In 2008, Doggett received dividends of up to $1,000 from his investment of up to $15,000 in Citigroup, which fielded $50 million in bailout money, according to the New York Times. In 2009, Doggett reported Citigroup dividends of up to $200. --Also in 2008, Doggett reported dividends of up to $5,000 from his investment of up to $100,000 in JP Morgan Chase, another bailout beneficiary. In 2009, dividends from that investment totaled up to $2,500, he reported, and in 2010, the dividends amounted to up to $1,000. --Also in 2008, Doggett reported earning up to $2,500 in dividends on up to $15,000 invested in Wachovia, which became Wells Fargo, another bailout beneficiary. In 2009 and 2010, Doggett had up to $200 in dividends on the Wells Fargo investments. About $16,000 in gains is far short of millions. As we mulled this, Romo’s campaign consultant, Vince Leibowitz, emailed us a memo stating Romo’s claim is based on Doggett’s financial disclosure statements covering his first 16 years in Congress, including the recent bailout period. The filings show, Leibowitz said, that Doggett reaped millions of dollars over his House career from direct and indirect investments, through mutual funds and other investment devices, in banks and financial services firms including Bank of America. That may be. Then again, Romo’s mailer says Doggett made millions off companies like Bank of America "while" those companies took the bailout aid. Why consider Doggett’s investment earnings over his House career? Leibowitz replied by email: "I'm afraid that we may have to discuss the proper usage of ‘while,’ as that may be what is causing the confusion. ‘While’ is not only a subordinating conjunction, but one that may be used in the contrastive sense. For example, ‘I like to read the" Austin American-Statesman "print edition while my fiancee prefers the Washington Post online.’ He said Romo used "while" in her mailer in the contrastive sense (like the word "whereas"), not to necessarily indicate that Doggett made millions at the same time companies were taking the bailout money. Regardless, Leibowitz said, Doggett also reaped millions starting in 2008, noting a list compiled by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, placing Doggett among the richest members of Congress. The listing states Doggett’s reported assets for 2010 at $8.8 million against $250,000 in liabilities; the article says Doggett’s net worth increased 6 percent from 2009 to 2010.. From 2008 to 2010, according to research by the Center for Responsive Politics, Doggett’s net worth increased from up to $19 million to nearly $22 million or, at the low end, from $6.9 million to $8.3 million. The Romo campaign’s memo on her claim says that Doggett’s net worth, per his financial disclosure filings, more than doubled from as much as $9.2 million when Doggett joined the House in 1995 to as much as $21.7 million in 2010. Leibowitz, referencing Doggett’s financial disclosure filings, noted that Doggett has long reported holdings in a dozen banks and financial services companies. Also, Leibowitz said, Doggett has invested in multiple mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. "A number of those are heavily invested in the financial services industry, meaning that money Doggett invests in these mutual funds and (ETFs) in turn is essentially invested on a pro-rata basis in the same companies," Leibowitz said. He listed nine 2010 Doggett investments in funds and each one’s related stakes in the financial services sector -- of up to 31 percent. Leibowitz said Romo considers all companies in the financial services sector to be "like Bank of America," a reference to her mailer’s message. Ultimately, Leibowitz said, Doggett made millions from his investments in individual financial service sector stocks and off investments in mutual funds and ETFs "heavily invested" in the financial services sector. Our ruling . In her mailer, Romo says Doggett "made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money." We think it’s most reasonable to read Romo’s "while" as meaning Doggett made the millions at the same time companies took the bailout aid. That in mind, Doggett’s overall net worth may have climbed by several million dollars during the bank bailout years, though his earnings directly from stock in Bank of America and companies that fielded bailout money appears to have been less than $20,000 in those years. By tying Doggett’s increase in net worth directly to bailed-out banks, Romo’s statement conflates and inflates. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03005	Says Jeanne Shaheen "got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/oct/16/jennifer-horn/nh-gop-chairwoman-horn-says-jeanne-shaheen-got-beh/	The 2014 election may still be more than a year away, but Republicans are already offering reasons why they think U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., should be defeated. New Hampshire Republican Chairwoman Jennifer Horn accused Shaheen of encouraging the Internal Revenue Service to impose more oversight on specific political groups. At a New Hampshire Republican Party fundraiser in August, Horn told the audience that Shaheen "signed a letter to the IRS asking them to look more closely at some of these 501(c)(4)s," and that Shaheen "got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views." Other Republicans picked up on the theme. On Sept. 18, Jim Rubens announced his intention to challenge Shaheen for her seat. During his speech, Rubens said Shaheen "has sicked the IRS on political groups that are saying unpopular things, breaching our First Amendment privileges." It’s been four months since Republicans first accused Shaheen and six other senators of pressuring the IRS to look into political groups in a letter the senators wrote to former IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman. But as the campaign season heats up, we thought we would see if there’s any truth to claims like Horn’s and Rubens’. When we asked Horn for the evidence behind her statement that Shaheen "got behind" using the IRS to target specific political groups, she pointed to two sources: a letter Shaheen signed last year, and the senator’s comments on 501(c)(4) organizations during floor speeches. The Letter Shaheen signed a letter on Feb. 16, 2012, that asked the IRS to review its oversight of 501(c)(4) organizations that get involved in politics. (The name refers to a section of the tax code.) The Internal Revenue Code grants tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations that promote social welfare. But Shaheen’s letter said some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The letter says the code specifies that social welfare "does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for political office." The letter came to prominence in May, after publication of a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that the IRS improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for such actions. But the accusation isn’t water-tight. Shaheen’s earliest letter was signed on Feb. 16, 2012, long after the date in 2010 cited by the Inspector General as the beginning of the IRS targeting specific groups. Her letter doesn’t mention ideological leaning of the political groups. Meanwhile, Shaheen and the same group of senators sent another letter to the IRS commissioner in March 2012. That letter did encourage the IRS to change the way it handles nonprofit organizations that spend money on politics, suggesting three changes, including that the organizations document the exact percentage of their money that goes toward social welfare. This letter didn’t mention partisan or ideological ties, either. Shaheen’s comments Horn also pointed to numerous floor speeches and comments, saying Shaheen only singled out conservative 501(c)(4) organizations, ignoring liberal social-welfare organizations that operate under the same model. Horn gave a July 17, 2012, floor speech as an example. In Shaheen’s prepared remarks, she only mentions one organization as an example: Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group. But in a video of the actual speech, she lists corporations, unions and nonprofit organizations as the groups who need transparent donation rules. She doesn’t name any one organization or party. Shaheen’s office also argued that the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending (or DISCLOSE) Act that the senator was speaking about on that day doesn’t directly address the IRS, as Horn implied. The act, which Shaheen has supported since 2010, requires groups to share information about their campaign contributions. While both the IRS regulations and the DISCLOSE Act deal with 501(c)(4) organizations, the first addresses their tax status while the second focuses on requirements to reveal their donors. Our Ruling Horn said Jeanne Shaheen "got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views." Shaheen did ask the IRS to tighten its oversight of groups that are tax-free because they’re supposed to be pursuing social welfare efforts, but which are actually spending substantial amounts of money on political campaigns. Shaheen, however, voiced her opinion about two years after the controversial IRS efforts were already under way, and there is no evidence that she was aware of alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups before it became public in the Inspector General’s report. What Shaheen actually "got behind" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires non-profit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. It’s a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens "for their political views." At most, her scrutiny was aimed at ensuring transparency about the funding sources for groups across the ideological spectrum. On balance, we rate Horn’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-05010	Says if labor force participation rate were the same as when Barack Obama became president, unemployment would be 11 percent.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/17/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-unemployment-would-be-11-percent-sa/	At the Texas Republican Party’s 2012 convention, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin told the crowd that the high stakes in November’s election include American jobs. "If the amount of Americans were in the workforce today like they were when President Obama took office, the labor force participation rate, our unemployment rate would be 11 percent today," the House Budget Committee chairman said in his keynote speech June 9, 2012. We decided to check. First, we defined our terms. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the U.S. labor force participation rate by taking the total workforce -- people who are employed or job-hunting -- and dividing by the total civilian population aged 16 or older. (People in military, medical or penal institutions are excluded.) The general unemployment rate, which is the one most people are familiar with, expresses how many people in the labor force are unemployed. Generally, climbs and dips in the general unemployment rate are a reasonable indicator that more Americans are losing jobs or getting hired, respectively. But in times of recession, high numbers of workers simply stop looking for jobs. Common reasons they give are retirement, disability, going to school or caring for household members, according to researchers at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank who drew on federal data. But when adults stop looking for work, the overall workforce shrinks, which can have the effect of reducing the unemployment rate -- which could lead to erroneous conclusions about U.S. economic conditions. To counteract that effect, the BLS also calculates what it calls the U-6 unemployment rate, which folds in people who stopped job-hunting and people who took part-time jobs for economic reasons. Since the U-6 rate was first published in 1994, its three highest points have all accompanied recessions, first in 1990-91, then 2001 and most recently 2007-09. Of late, Republicans have taken to highlighting this distinction, as Ryan does here. His claim can be restated this way: If the same percentage of Americans were employed or looking for work in May 2012 as in January 2009, general unemployment would have been 11 percent instead of 8.2 percent. We asked Ryan’s office for his backup materials, and spokesman Kevin Seifert sent us data, calculations and supporting news coverage. Seifert told us by email that according to the BLS, the January 2009 workforce participation rate was 65.7 percent, while the May 2012 rate was 63.8 percent. Applying those to the May 2012 population of 243 million, he said, gives a labor force of 159.6 million at the first rate and 155 million at the latter rate. Subtracting the real labor force (155 million) from the hypothetical labor force (159.6 million) shows "that 4.6 million more people would actively be seeking work right now instead of being characterized as discouraged, etc.," he wrote. Adding 4.6 million unemployed workers to the May 2012 unemployment count, which was 12.7 million, would give a total 17.3 million unemployed, Seifert said. Then, 17.3 million unemployed people divided by 155 million would give a general unemployment rate of 11.2 percent, Seifert said. We checked the numbers and math for ourselves, then asked Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based regional economist for the labor bureau, for help analyzing the calculations. It looked to us like Ryan should have divided by the hypothetical labor force, rather than the real May 2012 labor force (to correctly describe the unemployment rate of the larger, hypothetical group), and Abbot agreed. But neither that distinction nor small differences due to causes such as rounding off numbers seriously affected the result. Accepting the assumption that all 4.6 million adults added to the labor force would be unemployed -- and using BLS figures that were not rounded off as much as the ones Seifert used to describe his math to us -- Abbot got a result of 10.9 percent. Our ruling The general unemployment rate in June 2012 would have been 10.9 percent if the labor force participation rate had remained at the 65.5 percent in place when Obama became president. That’s about 11 percent. We rate Ryan’s statement True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-07-17T16:36:05	2012-06-09	['None']

pomt-06208	"We have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/08/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-has-more-natural-gas-saudi-ar/	The United States’ "addiction" to imported oil is a hot topic on many presidential candidates’ platforms. During a November editorial board meeting with the Telegraph in New Hampshire, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman recycled some of that rhetoric when he discussed his push for energy independence in America. "I want to take some steps toward energy independence, which is completely doable," said Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China during the Barack Obama administration before he resigned to run for the Republican nomination for president. "We've talked about it under eight presidents. We've made very little in the way of positive forward momentum. We're still addicted to 60 percent imported oil, we have a transfer of wealth of 300 billion bucks a year to unfriendly transactional regimes in parts of the world. And I say, lets wake up to the fact that we have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil. And I say, how stupid are we?" More natural gas than all the oil in one of the world’s largest oil exporting nations? Really? We decided to break down Huntman’s comparison to find out. First, we contacted Huntsman’s campaign to get sources behind his energized claim, but the campaign didn’t return our calls or emails. We turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration for a little guidance on what seemed like comparing apples to oranges. Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics, said the issue is even more complicated than we thought. First, it involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them. Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Grape. On top of that, there are two different ways in which to look at how much of each type of energy is available. One way to look at it is as proved reserves, those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions. In other words, it's oil or natural gas that would be safe and profitable to produce now. Another, more uncertain approach to defining energy supply is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost. Let's start with proved reserves. Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. So the U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil. The technically recoverable resource estimates for Saudi Arabia could be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil. That's still less than the 700 billion barrel resource estimate for Saudi Arabia. But Huntsman would be correct if he was speaking about production, Grape said. "We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil." The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said. Our ruling We don't know whether Huntsman meant "proved" resources, estimates of technically recoverable resources or production totals when comparing U.S. gas to Saudi oil. Using the first two measures, his numbers fall short. If he was talking about production, he is correct, although Huntsman used the word "has," and not "produces." We rule his claim Mostly False.

pomt-09435	"House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/12/jim-demint/sen-jim-demint-says-obeys-partial-earmark-ban-woul/	No sooner had Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations panel, announced a plan to ban earmarks to for-profit companies than Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., sent out a blast of one-upmanship via Twitter. "House Appropriations Chair David Obey's partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks," DeMint wrote. "That's a fig leaf, not real reform." While Congress has steadily moved toward tighter earmark restrictions over the last several years, the issue has taken on renewed steam in light of the massive budget deficit and several high-profile ethics investigations. On Feb. 26, the House ethics committee absolved seven members of the defense spending panel accused of awarding earmarks to companies whose executives and lobbyists donated to their campaigns. Although they were cleared, the ethics committee said it was evident there was at least a perception among corporate donors that political donations have an impact on a legislator's decision to author an earmark for that company. It was just that kind of conflict that Rep. Obey said he was trying to eliminate when on March 10, 2010, he initiated a ban on budget earmarks to private, for-profit companies. The move -- one of several earmark reforms Obey instituted for the House -- was hailed by several government watchdog groups as a meaningful step for earmark reform. "For-profit company earmarks are ground zero for pay-to-play," said Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. But what about DeMint's Twitter claim that Obey's "partial earmark ban wouldn't apply to 90% of earmarks." By Obey's calculation (or more accurately, the research of his House Appropriation Committee staff) the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies would have eliminated about 1,000 earmarks this year, which came to a total of about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers for Common Sense, which looked not only at the roughly 9,000 disclosed earmarks this fiscal year but also pored through the budget and came up with several hundred more projects it deemed to be earmarks, put the total number of earmarks at 9,499, totaling $15.9 billion. That puts the number of earmarks not going to for-profits awfully close to DeMint's 90 percent. Democrats don't really take issue with that statistic. It's what citing that figure implies, as well as the follow-up comment that Obey's ban of earmarks to for-profits is "a fig leaf, not real reform." ''The political reality right now is that the public has lost some confidence in this institution, and one of the reasons is the past abuses of the earmark process,'' Obey told the New York Times. Earmarks for profit-making companies are ''the most vulnerable place'' for abuse in the system, he said. "It's a step forward," Ellis said. "It's not the answer, the be-all-end-all. But I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. It's real. We've been making progress on earmarks for several years now. And I'm fine with that. I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good." The day after Obey announced the changes, House Republicans went one step further, saying their members would renounce all earmarks for the rest of the year. In the Senate, however, banning any earmarks has much less traction. Senate Appropriations panel chair Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, Obey's Senate counterpart and a staunch defender of earmarks, called Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits "quizzical." "Many, if not most, for-profit and nonprofit entities lobby for themselves or employ lobbyists," Inouye told AP. "That is how most of them make the Congress aware of their products and services. It is no secret that many of these individuals make political contributions. All lobbyists file disclosure reports. These contributions are all fully disclosed and available for all to see on the Internet." Inouye told the New York Times that the partial ban amounted to Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, that current earmark restrictions were already working and that ''it does not make sense to discriminate against for-profit organizations'' by banning earmarks to them. A difference in earmark policy between the two chambers would certainly make for some interesting drama when the House and Senate begin to reconcile spending bills later this year. But DeMint, a self-described "recovering earmarker," would like to nip this issue in the bud now. DeMint vowed to force a Senate vote on a proposal he introduced earlier this year -- along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and 15 Republican co-sponsors -- that would put a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. In the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, DeMint floated a similar moratorium proposal. The bill was co-sponsored by then-presidential front-runners John McCain as well as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but it failed by a vote of 71-29. "The Senate will have the opportunity this week to stand with Americans and put a stop to this wasteful spending," DeMint said. "Our nation is drowning in debt that will be paid by our children and we’ll never stop Washington’s spending addiction unless members of both parties take bold action. We need to focus on balancing the budget, not pork barrel spending that has wasted money on bridges to nowhere, teapot museums and monuments to politicians." Obey told the New York Times that banning all earmarks would make Congress ''a rubber stamp'' of the executive branch. ''Where I come from, the Congress has a perfect right, in fact an obligation, to participate in the budget process, but we've got to try to do it in a way that protects the integrity of the system,'' he said. ''This strikes a reasonable balance.'' Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said a one-year moratorium is great, "but to what end?" A moratorium puts off the issue for a year, he said, but Congress still needs a long-term fix to its spending protocol. Some of the projects financed by earmarks are worthy of federal dollars, Ellis said. The problem, he said, is that earmarks are based more on the political muscle of their sponsors than project merit. We think DeMint is a little too dismissive when he calls Obey's ban on earmarks to for-profits a "fig leaf." As the recent ethics report found, private companies certainly believe their contributions win them earmarks. And it's naive to think they don't. So at the very least, Obey's plan addresses some of the worst abuses of the earmark process head-on. But the fact we're checking here is whether eliminating those for-profit earmarks would leave 90 percent of earmarks untouched. It would.

pomt-10911	"Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/01/nancy-pelosi/did-wages-fall-18-percent-after-donald-trumps-tax-/	Democrats have countered President Donald Trump’s message of positive economic growth by trying to highlight parts of the economy that haven’t been so strong on his watch. Recently, Democrats found a potent example: wage stagnation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was among a number of Democrats and liberal groups that shared this assertion about wages following the passage of Trump’s tax cut. On July 26, she tweeted a link to a Vox.com article, adding: Paul Ryan on June 24th: "Wages are rising." Reality: "Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Others who tweeted the same talking point included the Democratic Governors Association and the Fight for 15 coalition, which pushes for a higher minimum wage. The talking point about plummeting wages is at best outdated, given the release of new information. In addition, the data cited is not one of several official measurements, and it appears to be a statistical outlier. Where the number comes from The statistic reached its widest audience after Vox published an article citing it July 23. The finding was previously noted in a Bloomberg column July 18 and, even earlier, in a CBS News article July 11. The first thing to know is that the wage data in question did not come from longstanding government statistical series. Rather, it came from the PayScale Index, a calculation made by a private group. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a problematic source, but it does mean that it needs to be weighed against the wage statistics compiled by the federal government, which are considered the gold standard. When the 1.8 percent decline first hit the media, official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not available for that same quarter — the second quarter of 2018. However, by the time Democrats and their allies began tweeting about the PayScale data, the second-quarter BLS data had become publicly available. When we looked at a standard BLS measurement for wages — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers — we found that this measurement actually rose slightly between the first and second quarter of 2018, from $350 a week to $351 a week. That's an increase of less than three tenths of 1 percent, rather than down by 1.8 percent. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com What other measures show Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, suggested three additional BLS statistics to consult: average hourly earnings for all private employees; hourly earnings for manufacturing; and the employment cost index for private industry workers. Burtless adjusted each of these statistics for inflation and created an index showing how much each of the four wage measures had increased since the end of 2007. (In his system, the final data point of 2007 is pegged at 100, with any subsequent number above 100 showing how much it rose compared to the 2007 reference point.) Here’s his final graph. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Key: Blue = average real hourly earnings of all private employers; red = hourly earnings for manufacturing; green = median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers; purple = employment cost index: wages and salaries for private industry. Generally speaking, the four BLS statistics have moved in tandem, showing wage increases above inflation since 2014, with a bit of a slowdown since 2016. At worst, wages are going sideways or moving slightly higher in the most recent quarter — not suddenly crashing, as the PayScale data indicated. "I don’t think there’s any evidence I would trust that inflation-adjusted wages have declined noticeably, either over the entire Trump administration or in the period since Congress passed the new tax law," Burtless said. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, concurred. "It’s certainly fair to say real wages are not rising rapidly, and depending on the index chosen and the exact time period, they could even be falling slightly, but there is no plausible story where they fell 1.8 percent between the first and second quarter," Baker said. A spokesman for Pelosi said the tweet -- which was written by staff, not Pelosi -- "quotes word for word" from the Vox article and attached the link "for full context and openness." PayScale, for its part, acknowledges that comparing the PayScale Index to other BLS statistics "is comparing apples to pears." In a blog post, the company’s chief economist and vice president of data analytics, Katie Bardaro, wrote that the PayScale Index is designed to capture how workers’ wages change as they switch companies, while a BLS measure like the Employment Cost Index does not. She concluded, "Be careful of spurious comparisons of distinct measures and be sure to understand the underlying methodology of any metric you bring into your data arsenal." Our ruling Pelosi tweeted, "Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent." There's a grain of truth, in that one unofficial measurement did produce that finding. But it is an outlier. Official statistics contradicted that, showing stable or modestly rising wages. Those were available before the recent social media traffic. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06257	"We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/29/john-kasich/ohio-gov-john-kasich-says-key-legislation-has-won-/	Gov. John Kasich often laments how partisan Ohio politics have become. The Republican leader typically blames Democrats for not having an open mind to at least consider his ideas. Democrats, of course, beg to differ. They blame what they call the governor’s ultra-conservative agenda for causing needless division. And at the top of their list is Senate Bill 5, the controversial collective bargaining law that voters overwhelmingly chose to repeal earlier this month. There’s no doubt that SB5, from the time it was introduced in February, has been the most divisive piece of legislation the state has seen in years. After a bitter referendum campaign launched by Democrats and unions, voters trounced the Kasich-backed law on Nov. 8 by 22 points. Since then, the governor has tried to quickly turn the page. He still won’t talk much about the defeat. But he is trying to heal the divide by reminding Ohioans that partisanship has not always ruled the day during his first 10 months in office. "We have had some significant accomplishments on a bipartisan basis," Kasich said on Election Night, conceding the loss of Issue 2, the Senate Bill 5 referendum. "And you all know that I’m interested in trying to do things as often as we can with members of the other party." Was Kasich giving an accurate picture of the record, or was he trying to limit the potential political fallout from losing on a signature piece of legislation? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check. Certainly, Republicans and Democrats have been far apart on a number of initiatives the governor has ushered through with the help of a compliant GOP-controlled legislature, including his controversial state budget that cut aid to schools and communities. Democrats also have opposed Kasich’s efforts to privatize some state operations, and they panned the governor’s rejection of more than $400 million in federal funding for a new passenger train system. But Kasich will tell you that he has won bipartisan support on his proposals for prison sentencing reform, business regulatory reforms, business tax credits, and reining in so-called prescription pill mills. And indeed he has. — House Bill 93 cracks down on pain management clinics and punishes doctors who over-prescribe prescription medication, a huge problem in Southern Ohio. Both the Ohio House and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which Kasich has signed into law. — House Bill 86 will allow some felons to get out of prison early and others to skip prison altogether. Judges will have the discretion to send non-violent offenders to halfway houses instead of prisons and some felons who have served at least 80 percent of their sentences can be released. It passed the Senate 30 to 3 and the House 87 to 9, with support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. — House Bill 58 expands the job retention tax credit program and allows for other tax incentives for businesses. The governor used this program to help keep American Greetings in Northeast Ohio after the company said it was considering moving its headquarters to Illinois. With an emergency clause to allow the bill to become law immediately, it passed the Senate 31 to 1 and House 89 to 6. The governor’s regulatory reform measure that, among other things, requires state agencies with a role in economic development to review and adjust rules that are considered a hindrance to business development, and his JobsOhio program that turns job creation over to a private board appointed by the governor also both received bipartisan support. These are significant pieces of legislation. And each received a healthy dose of Democratic, as well as Republican, support. Some Ohioans may have forgotten about these new laws, which no one is trying to repeal. But the governor has not. We rate Kasich’s statement as True.

pomt-02384	In the recent House special election in Florida, Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/14/democratic-national-committee/democrats-say-alex-sink-got-outspent-republican-di/	The votes in the special election for Florida’s 13th Congressional District were barely in before the blame game began. On March 11, 2013, Republican David Jolly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the high-profile Pinellas County race to fill the seat of the late Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Shortly after Sink lost, the Democratic National Committee sent out a fundraising email signed by the DNC’s CEO, Amy K. Dacey. In it, Dacey called the result "really scary" because "Republican super PACs and outside groups rode to the rescue of a straight-up corporate lobbyist (Jolly) -- spending $5 million to tear down his Democratic opponent." After urging recipients of the email to "chip in $3 or more," Dacey offered an analysis of the outcome: "In a district that Republicans have held for almost six decades, we nearly pulled off an incredible upset thanks to grassroots support from Democrats like you -- but we fell short for one reason: We got outspent in a Republican district. And call me old fashioned, but I think people, and not special interests, should decide elections." We wondered whether the DNC is correct to say that Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district." We’ll address the claim in two parts. Did Democrats get outspent? Some money in campaigns is raised and spent by the candidate. Other funds are spent by outside groups, ranging from state parties to labor unions to the National Rifle Association. To fully understand how much money is sloshing around a particular race, you have to include both types. You also have to combine the money spent to promote a candidate with that spent to attack their opponent. Michael Beckel -- a reporter with the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics -- looked at how much the candidates reported raising and spending in their official Federal Election Commission disclosures through Feb. 19, the last pre-election filing date. He then looked at the amounts they reported raising when they filed more limited "48-hour" reports through election day. Finally, Beckel added the amounts spent by outside groups. Beckel’s total? About $6.4 million for "Team Sink," and about $6.3 million for "Team Jolly." "Both Democrats and Republicans went all-in," Beckel told PolitiFact. "Neither side can claim to have been outgunned." This is not to say there weren’t differences in where the two campaigns’ financial support came from. And those are relevant points when checking the DNC’s comment. When we checked with the DNC, they noted that spending by outside groups tilted toward Jolly. They are correct. Here’s a summary of both outside spending and candidate spending in the special election, using data from the Center for Responsive Politics. (It differs slightly from Beckel’s calculations, but is generally similar.) Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Outside spending $3,752,057 $5,070,604 Candidate spending $1,569,762 $857,997 Total spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601 This shows that Jolly benefited from a level of outside spending that was about 35 percent higher than what Sink benefited from. By contrast, Sink outraised Jolly in money that her own campaign raised. She raised about 80 percent more than Jolly did. On balance, Jolly and the outside groups that supported him did outspend Sink and her allies by about $600,000 -- an 11 percent edge, give or take. But this isn’t the whole story. As we noted, this data on spending stops at Feb. 19, a point several weeks before the election. Stopping here ignores what each candidate had in their war chest -- much of which they would presumably want to spend through the election. So we also looked at what each of the candidates had as "cash on hand" -- essentially, money that hadn’t been spent yet. Here’s what we found: Data through Feb. 19 Pro-Sink Pro-Jolly Candidate + outside spending $5,321,819 $5,928,601 Cash on Hand $971,587 $182,189 Spending plus cash on hand $6,293,406 $6,110,790 So, adding in cash on hand that was likely to be spent before election day, the advantage shifts to "Team Sink." This data suggests that her financial position was no worse in this election than Jolly’s, and perhaps a little better. And that would undercut the DNC’s point that she "got outspent." "Jolly’s campaign may have been sunk without outside groups coming to his aid, but that’s only part of the story," Beckel said. "Thanks to outside group activity on both sides, neither candidate was outgunned. Both Democrats and Republicans made huge investments in the race." Is Florida’s 13th a Republican district? On this question, too, the data is mixed. On the one hand, the district's party registration breakdown is 170,402 Republicans and 159,022 Democrats (plus 111,114 without a party affiliation). The seat had been held (with some variations in its borders) by Young, a Republican, for 44 years. In recent years, his worst re-election margin was 57 percent of the vote. And a widely used method for characterizing the political leanings of districts -- the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index -- calls the 13th a "Republican +2" district, which means that during the previous two presidential elections, the district voted an average of 2 points more Republican than the nation did as a whole. But other factors suggest that calling the 13th a "Republican district" is an exaggeration. Since voters do not always vote in lockstep with their party, Democrats have fared well in the 13th in recent years. Barack Obama won the district in 2008 by nearly 4 percentage points, and in 2012 by 1.4 percentage points. Sink won the district both during her losing gubernatorial bid in 2010 and her successful run for chief financial officer in 2006. Given this, Young’s margins of victory are an outlier that have more to do with his long tenure as an incumbent. And a district that is "Republican +2" places it near the exact partisan middle of the House of Representatives. In the world of political handicappers, this means the 13th is a quintessential "competitive" or "swing" district, not a Republican one. "It's about as evenly divided as you can get," said David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. "We thought this district was competitive before the election, and we still think it’s a competitive district after the election," agreed Nathan Gonzales, who analyzes races for the similarly nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Our ruling In a fundraising letter after the Florida special election, the Democratic National Committee said Democrats "got outspent in a Republican district." Both claims have a grain of truth, but are exaggerated. By the Feb. 19 cutoff for disclosure -- a few weeks before the election was held -- Jolly and his supporters had outspent Sink and her supporters. But if you take into account Sink’s big advantage in banked money -- dollars she was likely to spend in the race’s final weeks -- that edge disappears, and "Team Sink" takes a narrow overall lead. Meanwhile, nonpartisan analysts agree that the district is more accurately labeled "toss-up" than "Republican" in its partisan leanings. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-11440	"Singer Miley Cyrus: ‘Trump fans are destroying my career, I can’t stand them and I decided to move to…’"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/14/blog-posting/fake-news-claims-miley-cyrus-says-trump-supporters/	In 2016, pop singer Miley Cyrus really did threaten to leave the United States if Donald Trump was elected president. New rumors have circulated on the Internet that Cyrus is now revisiting that promise and that Trump fans are ruining her career. "Singer Miley Cyrus: ‘Trump fans are destroying my career, I can’t stand them and I decided to move to…’" read the headline on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to Billboard magazine in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters. In the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments. Cyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues. When searching for the quotes attributed to Cyrus, we found no results of the statements. Celebrity news fact-checking site Gossip Cop also confirmed that Cyrus never accused Trump supporters of hurting her album sales. We did find an actual recent interview with Wonderland Magazine where Cyrus was featured on the cover. In that interview, she talked about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now. Cyrus’s latest album, Younger Now, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the Billboard charts. Even though last year Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she recently backtracked, calling it "ignorant" to leave the country because of the president. Our ruling A fake news story said that Miley Cyrus is blaming Trump supporters for her discontentment with her career and that she is planning to leave the United States. Cyrus has recently expressed satisfaction of her career and life, and she specifically reversed her prior feelings on leaving the country. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03779	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed held not one conversation with the public about the new Falcons stadium project	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/01/william-perry/watchdog-says-reed-didnt-talk-public-about-stadium/	The Falcons are thisclose to having a clear path for a new stadium built in downtown Atlanta. The team and city officials reached agreement on a deal for the almost $1 billion stadium a few weeks ago. Already, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority (which will own the stadium) and the Atlanta City Council have OK’d the deal, which includes using $200 million in city hotel-motel taxes toward construction costs and potentially several times that amount toward financing, maintaining and operating the stadium through 2050. All that’s left is approval from Invest Atlanta, the city’s development authority. In the meantime, ethics watchdog William Perry criticized Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for rushing the deal, and not allowing enough time for public input. "Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed was quoted in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying Atlanta would have a ‘big public conversation.’" We would get an information blitz, he said. But the mayor held not one conversation with the public," said Perry, executive director of government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia. Not one? PolitiFact Georgia has examined several other claims about the stadium deal, including some that were made during meetings about the project. We decided to walk backward through time and examine the weeks leading up to the stadium deal announcement. Perry’s statement appeared last month in an opinion piece for Creative Loafing Atlanta two days after the Atlanta City Council approved the stadium funding plan. A Feb. 8 AJC article quoted Reed as promising "a big public conversation" about the new stadium. "We’re going to give the public every piece of data that we can possibly give them. Everything is going to be known," the mayor went on to say. "Questions are going to be answered in public and on television." The City Council vote came late on a Monday evening after hours of debate between council members. The meeting was public and televised. Reed attended that council session and spoke to the body about the project. But his attendance there -- nor at any other council meeting -- doesn’t qualify as the mayor holding a public conversation on the issue, Perry told PolitiFact Georgia. The Atlanta City Council held several public meetings or work sessions convened by either the chairwoman of the finance executive committee or the council president, Perry said. But none of them were initiated by Reed or his office. We checked with the City Council, and Felicia Moore, who heads the committee that handled the stadium deal, sent us a list of all seven council meetings involving the project. According to Moore’s list, the first meeting was held Feb. 13, and it ended with a committee work session on March 21, three days after the full council approved the deal. The mayor or a representative from his office attended each of the meetings, according to Moore’s notes. The meetings were open to the public, but visitors were only allowed to speak at some of the meetings. "The mayor’s office did not schedule any of those meetings," Moore told PolitiFact Georgia. She was one of four council members who opposed the final funding plan. Moore told her council colleagues that they needed to take time to further vet the deal that will impact the city for at least the next 50 years. Once a proposal was crafted, and before the council and other groups voted, Perry thought there would be public meetings held so people could read through the document and give testimony, he said. "The bottom line is if you’re trying to ramrod something through, the way to do that is to have less public conversation about it. I don’t feel like he lived up to the promise of an information blitz." We took Perry’s claim to Reed’s office, and his spokeswoman, Sonji Jacobs, blitzed us with information contradicting the watchdog leader. She called Perry’s claim "blatantly false and misleading." Jacobs’ three-page report to PolitiFact Georgia detailed the same council meetings that were on Moore’s list, along with meetings held by the GWCCA and Invest Atlanta, of which Reed is the chairman. The meetings were open to the public, and some were broadcast on the city’s cable television station and city website. (Perry says he sent a letter to Reed in February requesting a public forum. He did not receive a response, and was initially reassured by the mayor’s promise of an information blitz.) The meetings were not initiated by Reed’s office. Jacobs said that’s not the way things work with Atlanta’s city governance. "The mayor’s office doesn’t organize meetings. We conduct our meetings in concert with council, which enables us to engage the council and the public in a more efficient manner," Jacobs said. Holding a duplicate set of meetings hosted by the mayor would be wasteful and inefficient, Jacobs said. That process holds true with not only the City Council, but also community groups, and city entities like the GWCCA. The mayor or one of his senior staff attends those meetings, presents information and answers questions of the public or other officials, as has happened during annual budget deliberations, for example. One of the few occasions that Reed has initiated a public meeting was a town hall meeting in 2010 introducing the three police chief candidates to the public. With the new stadium project, no one, or no group, asked Reed’s office to hold a town hall meeting, Jacobs said. Reed and Perry have gotten into verbal fisticuffs before. PolitiFact Georgia examined a claim last January by Perry that Atlanta had established a convoluted process for awarding airport concession contracts. Earlier that same month, we checked a claim by Reed that some Common Cause Georgia members had accepted maximum campaign contributions even though the group criticized the contributions given to Reed by airport vendors. We checked with political science professors, and the issue falls into a gray area. Typically mayors don’t hold public hearings, they are usually done in conjunction with the legislative body (city council) or other department or agency, said Michael Rich, assistant professor of political science at Emory University. But there are other methods of communicating with the public other than town hall meetings and forums, such as establishing a website for comments and soliciting written comments. And in instances involving highly controversial issues, Rich said, mayors have sometimes initiated the public meetings. So, does Perry score a touchdown -- or at least a field goal -- with his claim that Mayor Reed did not hold one conversation with the public leading up to the new Falcons stadium deal? Hard to say. There were meetings held, most of the meetings were open to the public and many were televised and streamed on the city’s website. Reed used the collective "we" in describing the information blitz that would be provided on the stadium plan. It is typically the legislative branch of government that initiates public meetings -- in this case the Atlanta City Council -- and not the executive branch, or mayor’s office. The mayor or at least one of his senior staff did attend stadium meetings held by the City Council and other city entities. But the mayor did not initiate any of those meetings. And Reed did not host any town hall meetings in the communities that will be impacted most by the stadium. Perry has a point -- Reed could have done a lot more to engage the public in person. But Perry’s statement needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rated Perry’s statement Half True.	None	William Perry	None	None	None	2013-04-01T07:44:43	2013-03-20	['Kasim_Reed', 'Atlanta']

pomt-13729	"The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-exaggerates-increase-world-opinion-us/	During Bill Clinton’s Democratic convention speech about Hillary Clinton, the former president touted his wife’s efforts as secretary of state to improve the levels of support for the United States across the globe. He cited his wife as "one of the reasons the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it." We decided to check whether the approval ratings he cited were accurate. We found four surveys that asked questions on a regular basis about how the United States is seen in other countries. We’ll go through them one by one. Pew Research Center We found Pew data for surveys taken in 20 countries between 2008 and 2013. Respondents were asked, "Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the United States." The figures in the chart below show the change in the favorable ratings -- either up or down -- between 2008, the year before Clinton became secretary of state, and 2013, the year she stepped down from the post. The countries are listed in descending order from the most positive change to the most negative change during her tenure. Country Change in approval of U.S., 2008-13* Spain +29 Indonesia +24 Germany +22 France +22 Australia +20 Argentina +19 Japan +19 Mexico +19 South Africa +12 Tanzania +10 Turkey +9 South Korea +8 Russia +5 United Kingdom +5 Poland -1 China -1 Lebanon -4 Jordan -5 Egypt -6 Pakistan -8 Median country, not weighted for population +10 * except Tanzania, which is for the years 2008 to 2014 So eight countries met or came close to the 20-point increase Clinton cited, but 12 did not. Taking into account the whole list of 20 countries, the median change for the countries surveyed was a gain of 10 percentage points. That’s a significant increase, but it’s not the 20 percentage-point increase Clinton cited. BBC As we have previously noted, the BBC World Service/Globescan survey undertakes an annual country ratings poll that asks about respondents’ view of various countries’ "influence in the world" -- either "mostly positive" or "mostly negative." In 2008, the poll found that 35 percent of people said world influence of the United States was "mostly positive" and 47 percent said it was "mostly negative." In the late 2012-early 2013 poll, that number had risen to 45 percent. That’s an increase of 10 percentage points during Clinton’s tenure -- in line with the median country in the Pew survey, but still half of what Bill Clinton said. Gallup Finally, every year, Gallup has asked respondents in various countries, "Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leaders" of various countries, including the United States. In 2008, the United States had a 34 percent approval rating. By 2013, that had risen to 46 percent. That’s an increase of 12 percentage points -- once again, roughly in line with the Pew and BBC polls and less than what Clinton said. Meridian International Center When we asked the Clinton campaign for supporting evidence, they pointed to a survey by the Meridian International Center and Gallup’s U.S.-Global Leadership Project. Between 2008 and 2013, they said, the median U.S. approval rating in Europe grew from 18 percent to 41 percent. That’s a 23-point increase--but it’s also just for Europe, a limitation Clinton didn’t specify. And the data for Asia in the same poll and the same time frame, according to the campaign, showed an increase from 31 percent to 45 percent. That’s a rise of 14 points, which is less than the 20-point benchmark Clinton used. So we don’t see the Meridian International Center data as supporting Clinton’s assertion. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, "The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it." The approval ratings for the United States did go up on Hillary Clinton’s watch, and the Pew poll found that in some countries they did go up by 19 points or more. Still, the median increase in the Pew polling was a more modest 10 points, and the increases in the BBC and Gallup polls were in the same ballpark -- 10 to 12 points. On balance, we rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/346ff278-87b9-465c-8627-958fae7a7561	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-27T00:33:38	2016-07-26	['United_States', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']

pomt-11055	Florida taxpayers "pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jun/26/adam-putnam/do-florida-taxpayers-pay-tens-millions-dollars-yea/	In an interview with Fox News, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam outlined his approach to illegal immigration if elected governor of Florida. Florida has to act, Putnam said, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. Putnam touted his Secure Florida First Agenda, which includes establishing a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "In other words, Florida should have that relationship with ICE because Florida taxpayers are sick of paying tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens who ought to be in the custody of the feds and oughta be deported," Putnam said June 7. The economic impact of immigration is widely debated, so we wanted to take a look at Putnam’s statement. We found it’s uncertain how much money "illegal" immigrants in Florida prisons cost taxpayers. That’s because Florida doesn’t keep tabs on whether inmates are in the country legally or illegally. Flaws in Putnam’s evidence Putnam campaign spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice said that there are two ways to calculate the "tens of millions" dollar figure he is referring to. The problem, though, is that his calculation for "illegal immigrants" includes inmates who are not U.S. citizens but are in the country legally. Putnam’s team multiplied the total state Department of Corrections budget ($2.3 billion) by the percent of "criminal illegal aliens" in Florida’s prisons, which Putnam said was 4.8 percent. That 4.8 percent of Corrections budget is roughly $110 million. In the second calculation, Putnam multiplied the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day ($55.80, according to the Florida Department Of Corrections) by the number of days in a year. Then he multiplied that total ($20,367) by the number of "criminal illegal immigrants" in Florida prisons, which he said was 4,754. That works out to around $96.8 million. But terminology matters. Putnam is referring to that 4,754 figure as all "illegal aliens," but in fact the state prison system labels them simply "aliens." That might sound like a small difference, but it isn’t. The term "aliens" actually refers to all people who are not U.S. citizens, those who arrived both legally and illegally. The state of Florida only keeps a count of all aliens. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, "the vast majority of alien inmates" are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation. It's possible undocumented immigrants make up a good share of the "alien" population, but Putnam still would have no way of knowing the exact numbers. "If the state of Florida doesn’t track illegal immigrants in prison (they don’t) then that number is not knowable," said Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh. Another problem is that even if 4.8 percent of the prison population were released from the prison system, it does not mean it would have a direct 4.8 percent reduction on the total budget because of fixed costs, such as the cost to keep a prison running and administrative and security costs. Bryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said that reducing a small number of people from the prison will only really reduce the cost of clothing, food and direct health care service to that individual. "If they were to release all 5 percent of those people that’s probably not going to be enough to start laying off people and closing prison," Peterson said. "It's unrealistic to think it's going to have a direct five percent impact on their total budget." Our ruling Putnam said Florida taxpayers "pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens." Putnam's estimates for how much undocumented immigrants in prisons cost Florida taxpayers have several major problems. For starters, the state only tracks inmates who are not U.S. citizens, without diving into whether they are in the country legally or illegally. Even if we had the right numbers, experts told us that fixed costs for the prisons mean reducing the population yields uncertain cost savings. Eliminating a small percentage of inmates doesn’t mean the overall prison budget can be reduced by the same percentage. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12878	Says Barack "Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/27/blog-posting/fake-news-theres-no-bronze-statue-president-barack/	A fake story that claimed President Barack Obama was installing a pricey statue of himself in the White House before he left office has gone bust under a smidge of scrutiny. "Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House," read headlines across several websites in January. The latest version we saw was on Jan. 18, 2017, two days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, but there were many other examples. The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers’ news feeds. In the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled "statute," as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue "permanently erected in the entryway of the White House," the article asserted. Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office. Clearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House. The source of this false account is a Dec. 31, 2016, post on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is "intended for entertainment purposes only," and that its content can’t be reproduced without consent. We didn’t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets. There is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it’s not anywhere in the White House. It’s along the "avenue of heroes" near Puerto Rico’s Capitol building in San Juan, where the statue was installed in 2012. Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a trip to the commonwealth in 2011. The image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is dated Jan. 8, 2013. It looks like hoaxsters combined the statue image with a photo of the Oval Office. But even the background is not the Oval Office. It’s really a photo from the U.K.’s Mirror of a replica created by a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade. Wade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office at 80 percent scale. The composite doesn’t even feature Obama’s decor — the absence of his chunky mica coffee table was the giveaway. While EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there’s no evidence of that in the faux story. That’s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit. We’ve chiseled out the details to cast our own decision.

pomt-09942	On calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/03/newt-gingrich/gingrich-reverses-calling-sotomayor-racist/	Editor's Note: This is the first time we've deployed the Flip-O-Meter for a statement made on Twitter. It's truly a new era in political discourse — as long as the discourse can be contained in a 140-character tweet. One week after calling Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a racist through a tweet to his Twitter followers, Newt Gingrich says he is retracting the comment. It all started on May 26 when President Barack Obama named Sotomayor his nominee for the nation's highest court. Conservatives quickly seized on her comment from a 2001 speech that she hoped that "a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." The comment, they contended, showed Sotomayor would take race into account when making judicial decisions. Gingrich, a Republican who is a possible presidential candidate in 2012, joined the chorus of conservative critics the morning of May 27 with this tweet: "Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a latina woman' new racism is no better than old racism." (sic) Ten minutes later, he followed up with this: "White man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw." Other prominent Republicans echoed those sentiments. Rush Limbaugh called her a "reverse racist," and former Congressman Tom Tancredo said on MSNBC that "she appears to be a racist." Republican senators, meanwhile, were more measured. Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said that his committee "will engage in a fair and thorough examination of Ms. Sotomayor's previous judicial opinions, speeches, and academic writings to determine if she has demonstrated the characteristics that great judges share: integrity, impartiality, legal expertise, and a deep and unwavering respect for the rule of law." Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, went so far as to tell National Public Radio that Gingrich and Limbaugh's comments were "terrible" and that they were "not helpful under any circumstances." Now, a little more than a week later, Gingrich is changing his tune. "My initial reaction was strong and direct — perhaps too strong and too direct," Gingrich wrote June 3 on the conservative Web site Human Events. "The sentiment struck me as racist and I said so. Since then, some who want to have an open and honest consideration of Judge Sotomayor's fitness to serve on the nation's highest court have been critical of my word choice. With these critics who want to have an honest conversation, I agree. The word 'racist' should not have been applied to Judge Sotomayor as a person, even if her words themselves are unacceptable." Gingrich isn't backing down completely. "Sotomayor's words reveal a betrayal of a fundamental principle of the American system — that everyone is equal before the law," he wrote. Still, he's done a full 180 on his boldest criticism and the one that has been repeated countlessly by the media. He called her a racist and is now retracting that comment, which earns a Full Flop.

pomt-12929	Americans don't "care at all" about Donald Trump's tax returns.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/11/donald-trump/trump-wrong-reporters-are-only-ones-who-care-about/	In his first press conference since July 2016, President-elect Donald Trump scolded reporters for asking about his tax returns, saying members of the media are the only ones who care about the records. Trump said on Jan. 11, 2017, that he had no financial ties or business deals with Russia. He then dismissed the concerns of a reporter who asked Trump whether he would be releasing his tax returns to prove it. "I’m not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they’re under audit," Trump said. The reporter pointed out that presidents have been releasing their returns since the 1970s. Trump interrupted her and said, "Oh, gee, I never heard that." "You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They’re the only ones," he said, saying he thought the American public isn’t concerned about it. "I won; I mean, I became president. No, I don’t think they care at all. I don’t think they care at all. I think you care." Media outlets have called for Trump to release his returns throughout his campaign, and have increased calls since his election. Trump and his surrogates have offered myriad excuses as to why he won’t release any information. But are they the only people who care whether he does it? Polling data consistently shows that overall, a majority of Americans want to know what’s in Trump’s tax records. The vocal majority It’s been common practice for decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. Despite Trump’s argument that he isn’t releasing his because he’s being audited, the IRS has said he’s allowed to release them whether he’s under an audit or not (as Richard Nixon did). Tax returns show a lot of details about a president’s business dealings and financial background, much more than, say, campaign finance disclosures, which Trump has offered as an alternative. That explains the media interest, which Trump has attacked before. Trump’s transition team did not elaborate on his statement when we contacted them, but he is wrong to say that the public doesn’t care, by most polls. One such poll taken before Trump's news conference confirms most Americans said he should release the returns. Pew Research Center released a new poll Jan. 10, on the eve of Trump’s latest press conference, that re-examined how voters felt. The poll showed that close to two-thirds of Americans think the issue is important. The poll was conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points for the total sample. Sixty percent of the people polled by Pew said Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns. The numbers do vary broadly depending on political affiliation, however — 38 percent of Republicans or those leaning Republican agree he has a responsibility, compared to 79 percent of Democrats or those leaning to the left. There was a lot more polling about this topic before the Nov. 8 election. The way the questions were framed varies from poll to poll, so it's difficult to compare the figures directly. But generally they illustrate that Americans think Trump's tax returns are a serious issue. A Quinnipiac University poll released Aug. 25, 2016, showed that 74 percent of all voters said Trump should release his tax returns publicly. That figure dipped only slightly among Republicans, 62 percent of whom said he should release them. A Monmouth University poll the same week said that 62 percent of Americans thought it was either somewhat or very important to them that presidential candidates release their tax returns. A Fox News poll released Sept. 7 showed that 60 percent of voters, including 36 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats, thought Trump was hiding something in his tax returns. On Sept. 21, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 52 percent of voters were concerned about Trump not releasing his tax returns. The choice was among several options about voters’ areas of concern about both Trump and Clinton. "Trump’s comments and language about women, immigrants and Muslims" was the top concern with 69 percent, and "Trump not having the right temperament to serve as commander in chief" was second with 66 percent. "Trump’s praise for Vladimir Putin" also ranked as a higher concern, at 59 percent. One outlier was when Fox News asked voters in a poll conducted Sept. 27-29 whether "the fact that Donald Trump hasn’t released his tax returns bother you, or is it no big deal?" Forty-six percent of respondents answered "bothers me," while 52 percent said it was "no big deal." But even that tally shows about half of Americans were concerned that Trump hadn't released his tax returns. Our ruling Trump said Americans don't "care at all" about his tax returns. Several polls, including one released the day before his latest press conference, show that a sizable portion of the public does think Trump’s tax returns are an important issue. These polls word their questions differently, but most results showed a majority of Americans believed the issue was relevant, undermining Trump’s assertion that only the media wants to explore the issue.

pomt-15377	Only five states, including Georgia, do not have a hate crimes law.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/01/various-media-reports/south-carolina-georgia-3-other-states-dont-have-ha/	The U.S. Justice Department is weighing whether to bring a federal hate crimes charge in the June 17 church massacre in Charleston. The announcement has put the spotlight on the lack of a state-level law in South Carolina, as well as in a handful of other states. News media outlets, including Newsweek, and National Public Radio, have reported that South Carolina is one of only five states without a hate crimes law. PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig deeper into the claim. First, a little background. The FBI defines a hate crime as a traditional offense, such as murder, arson or vandalism, with the added element that the motivation is a bias based on race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. Nearly 6,000 hate crimes were reported by law enforcement agencies in 2013, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. In Charleston, authorities seemed fairly confident from the beginning that the mass shooting at historically black Emanuel A.M.E. Church was a hate crime. At a press conference on June 18, shellshocked city officials met with reporters to discuss the nine deaths and announce the arrest of suspect Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old high school dropout and sometimes construction worker who is white. "We believe this is a hate crime; that is how we are investigating it," Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said. According to news reports, witnesses claim Roof told victims before shooting them, "You are raping our women and taking over our country." Roof also reportedly said after his arrest that he been out to start a "race war." On June 18, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the Justice Department had opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the church shootings, which she termed a "barbaric crime." In media reports that followed, South Carolina, Arkansas, Wyoming, Indiana and Georgia -- were identified as five states out of 50 without hate crimes law. Steven M. Freeman, legal affairs director for the Anti-Defamation League, arguably the biggest advocacy group for these laws, said the list is accurate. But it’s clearly complicated. Newsweek first reported five states without hate crimes laws, then later revised its report to show only three states, Georgia, Arkansas and South Carolina. Michigan provided PolitiFact a copy of its hate crimes law, countering some reports that it belonged on the no-law list with Georgia. State hate crime laws can vary widely. Some are specific only to sexual orientation, while others address biases related to race and gender. Freeman said hate crime prosecution is best left to the states, since most crimes are investigated by state or local police. The federal hate crime law, he said, is meant as "a backstop." The federal hate crimes law has enhanced penalties for various crimes, as do most state laws of this nature. The filing of a federal hate crime charge in the Charleston church slayings could be viewed as largely symbolic since Roof is already charged with nine counts of murder, and South Carolina’s governor has called for the death penalty. Georgia unique Unlike South Carolina and the other three states, Georgia did have a hate crimes law. The Georgia General Assembly passed a hate crime bill in 2000 calling for enhanced prison sentences if a person or a person's property were victimized "because of bias or prejudice." The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, was thrown out as "unconstitutionally vague" in 2004 by the Georgia Supreme Court. It did not specifically outlaw crimes committed based on specific biases, related to a victim’s race, religion, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation, as laws in other states did. Fort has tried since the 2004 ruling to pass another hate crimes bill, but has been unsuccessful. He said last week that he will try to build on the momentum of Charleston and push for passage of a new law next year. Charleston brings home the point he was trying to make in 1999 when he first introduced Georgia’s bill, that a hate crime is "terrorism and terrorism is different," Fort said. "It ultimately is designed to intimidate, not just one person, but an entire group," he said. "That is an important lesson out of Charleston. Hate crimes are terrorism."What this man did in that church is nothing less than terrorism." Like Fort, Charleston lawmakers have said they are renewing their efforts to establish a South Carolina hate crimes law. Jeannine Bell, a professor of law at Indiana University at Bloomington and a nationally recognized scholar on the topic of hate crimes, said state hate crime laws are effective, but not for the reason most people think. "They are not needed to address hate murders like what occurred in Charleston," Bell said. "Hate murders are relatively rare." The vast majority of hate crimes are low- level crimes that, but for hate crime legislation would not even be investigated by the police, let alone prosecuted, she said. The hate crime legislation provides a way to punish crimes that extremely traumatize the victim and community, Bell said. She said she believes there is a stigma attached to states without any form of hate crime legislation. "It may not be as significant as the stigma attached to those states that fly the Confederate battle flag," Bell said. "But my question, as a scholar in this area is: ‘Why wouldn’t a state enact legislation that addresses extreme acts of bias directed at its citizens?’ I cannot see any downsides to the legislation." Some civil libertarians see "slipper slope" But hate crime laws do raise concerns for some. Jonathan Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School, said the biggest concern is the threat to free speech as more speech is declared hate speech. He points to Europe and Canada as prime examples of prime examples of the dangers of expansive definitions of hate speech. "Unless carefully defined, these laws can place societies on a slippery slope of speech regulation," Turley said. "Since there are already laws criminalizing threats and related crimes, civil libertarians have always cautioned legislators about the implications and necessity of such laws." Our ruling Attorney General Loretta Lynch has opened an investigation to determine whether a federal hate crimes charge should be brought in the mass church shooting in Charleston. This is in the absence of a state hate crimes law in South Carolina. The tragedy has drawn attention South Carolina, Georgia and three others identified as the only ones without state-level hate crime laws. The Anti-Defamation League, which has arguably been the biggest advocate of these laws, says research backs up that there are five states in this category.. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07038	"In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-claims-florida-led-country-job-grow/	With nearly a million Floridians struggling without jobs in the wake of the Great Recession, Gov. Rick "Let's get to work!" Scott has the right message. And May's job numbers gave him a new talking point. On June 23, 2011, as news media gathered at the state Capitol for his signing of a tort reform bill, he repeated it: "In May we generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined: 28,000 jobs in May for the state, 54,000 for the entire country." The unemployment rate in May dipped to 10.6 percent, a near two-year low after five straight months of improvement. Brag-worthy, right? But we were curious: Just how good was May for job creation in Florida? We checked with Scott's office and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks employment across the country. According to a standard measure of employment in April and May, Scott nailed the numbers -- Florida gained 28,000 jobs. (Ohio was second, gaining 12,000 jobs.) That standard look comes from a monthly survey of businesses to ask how many jobs they have. (It's different from the survey that informs the unemployment rate, which is a survey of households.) The business survey helps economists estimate a total number of jobs — in a county, in a metro area, in a state, in the nation. Those numbers can be sliced and diced any number of ways, but Scott picked a useful, mainstream measure: "total nonfarm employment" that had been "seasonally adjusted." Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically (you don't need many farm workers if there's no harvest this week). And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been "seasonally adjusted" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns. Feeling pretty good about Scott's grasp of the situation, we chatted with a few economists. And that's where it got weird. It turns out that while seasonal adjustment is typically a useful tool to make meaningful comparisons over time — allowing you to compare jobs progress during, say, a long, holiday-heavy December with a short February — there are some pretty good reasons it wasn't so helpful in May. Seasonal adjustment formulas are constantly updated based on recent years, to take into account "normal" over-the-month change. David Denslow, a research economist at the University of Florida, pointed out that when you have enormous changes, as with the recent housing boom and bust (remember that?) and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, seasonal adjustment "becomes extraordinarily difficult." So, what did the unadjusted survey numbers show? According to estimates that weren't adjusted for the season, Florida didn't gain 28,000 new jobs from April to May — it actually lost 3,000 jobs. Across the country, the United States added 682,000 jobs when not adjusted for the season (compared to 54,000 jobs when adjusted). The differences here are critical to note. So we'll repeat ourselves. Depending on the two calculations: • Florida gained 28,000 new jobs ... or lost 3,000 jobs. • The country as a whole gained 54,000 new jobs ... or gained 682,000. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist said the bureau attempted to minimize the affect "recent events" might have had on the seasonal adjustment calculation by putting more weight on earlier years than the more recent, irregular years. "In essence the irregular years do still have some influence on the seasonal adjustment factors for this year, however, by putting more weight on its history, the influence will be diminished," said Jonathan Hamburg, an economist who works with state and local statistics. Still, Denslow said, the significantly different stories the two stats tell raise some real questions. We're so used to seasonally adjusted numbers as the gold standard for comparing one month to another, we ran Denslow's concern by another economist who regularly chats with PolitiFact, Gary Burtless with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "One resolution of the problem," he said, "is simply to mention both sets of statistics to your readers and leave it for them to decide whether it is fair to say Florida 'generated more jobs than all the rest of the country combined' in a month when the best BLS estimate suggests the actual number of Florida jobs declined while the actual number of jobs in the nation as a whole increased." But he acknowledged we may all consider that a copout. So he pressed on to explain that with seasonal adjustment being the difference between job gains and losses, even a small error in the Bureau of Labor Statistics formula could make the governor’s claim "wildly off base." "It may be true, and perhaps revisions in the raw data or the seasonal adjustment factor may someday increase the probability that it is true," he said. "But based on the evidence at hand, I would say the governor has made a very silly claim." Where does this leave us? Scott accurately repeated an official statistic. But there's also a strong argument that the wild economic ride of recent years has made it challenging to accurately account for seasonal changes. Two economists we talked to say this undermines the credibility of Scott's claim — though we should note two others didn't mention the issue. But in light of a common federal statistic that shows the state may have actually lost jobs in May, the governor should have been more measured in his public trumpeting. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-07-01T19:10:54	2011-06-23	['None']
pomt-06370	"New Jersey alone, my home state, is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget. This means more cuts in state and local spending for education, which means our kids are hurt."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/03/robert-menendez/robert-menendez-says-new-jersey-budget-shortfall-m/	After more than 20 years of public service on the local, state and federal levels, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez should know you can’t adopt a state budget that doesn’t pay for itself. But that’s what Menendez, a Democrat, suggested during an Oct. 18 press conference about the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, which he recently introduced. The legislation is aimed at creating or protecting jobs for teachers, police officers and firefighters. "New Jersey alone, my home state, is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget," Menendez said. "This means more cuts in state and local spending for education, which means our kids are hurt." PolitiFact New Jersey found that although New Jersey is not meeting all of its statutory obligations, the fiscal year 2012 budget adopted in June is, as required by state law, a balanced spending plan with no shortfall. As for education spending, the budget actually increases state aid for public schools over the previous fiscal year. Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Menendez, acknowledged the senator was wrong to suggest there is a current budget shortfall. "So, yes, he used the wrong tense in expressing the need to invest in educators for our kids," Enright wrote in an email. "But, the need is there and the facts – as our Senator, and most Americans see them -- are clear." But let’s explain the history behind the $10.5 billion cited by Menendez. In July 2010, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated a "structural deficit" of nearly $10.5 billion for fiscal year 2012. That figure represented the difference between projected revenues from existing sources and the amount needed to pay for all spending required by state law and maintain current program levels. However, there’s a difference between what the state is legally obligated to spend and what is budgeted. The fiscal year 2012 budget does not entirely cover the spending level used to calculate the projected structural deficit, but the budget itself is balanced between its anticipated revenues and expenditures. In other words, there is no shortfall. It would be "unconstitutional" to adopt a budget with a built-in shortfall, and OLS is not projecting a shortfall to occur during fiscal year 2012, according to David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the OLS. "A budget shortfall during a fiscal year is a different animal than a structural deficit looking forward to a budget," Rosen told us. "Those are two different concepts, really." Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based, Democratic-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said a state can have a structural deficit as well as a balanced budget. Once a budget is balanced, that year’s budget shortfall has been addressed, she said. McNichol added, "Every year, a state will end up balancing its budget, one way or another." It’s worth pointing out that Gov. Chris Christie has since rejected the use of the structural deficit, calling for a zero-based budgeting approach. In a Sept. 30 email, Andrew Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, told us: "Except in theoretical terms, that means there are no longer any deficits to discuss." Now, let’s talk about education spending under the fiscal year 2012 budget. Menendez suggested that the budget means "more cuts in state and local spending for education." But as we’ve noted in previous rulings, the budget increases state aid for public schools by about $863 million over fiscal year 2011. The state is not funding public schools at the total level required by law, but funding is still up year-over-year, Rosen said. Our ruling Menendez claimed New Jersey "is facing a ten-and-a-half billion dollar shortfall in its 2012 fiscal budget," meaning more cuts in state spending on education. Although a nearly $10.5 billion structural deficit had been projected, the fiscal year 2012 budget is balanced, as required by state law. Also, the budget increases state aid for education over the previous fiscal year. Since Menendez is wrong about there being a budget shortfall and education funding cuts, we rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13660	Thanks to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-jumps-gun-discussing-tpp-and-vietname/	At a press conference with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership would improve global labor rights. Specifically, he said Vietnam had agreed to improve its labor policies as a condition of entering into the 12-country trade agreement, which has been contentious this election cycle. "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms, changing their Constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time," Obama said. We fact-checked another TPP claim from the press conference, on tariffs, elsewhere. Here, we look at Obama’s Vietnam claim. Labor law Before diving into what the TPP asks of Vietnam, let’s look at what protections Vietnam already affords workers. The 2013 Vietnamese Constitution provides for "break policies," "equal and safe" work conditions and protects against "discrimination, forced labor" and under-age workers. It also establishes trade unions to represent workers and protect their legal rights. According to a 2012 "Law on Trade Unions," however, this is an entity "placed under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam." Essentially, all trade unions must affiliate with the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour. We consulted various law firms that cover Vietnamese labor law, and they detailed Vietnam’s already-existing labor protections. According to the the Southeast Asian law firm Tilleke & Gibbins, Vietnam sets a maximum of 48 hours per week and provides mandatory rest periods of at minimum 24 consecutive hours per week. Employers are required to provide protective equipment, and there is maternity leave typically around four months. The labor law firm Fisher Phillips classified Vietnam’s labor law as "employee-friendly." We spoke to White House representatives who acknowledged Vietnam had such provisions. So, what then, was Obama referring to as "unprecedented" labor reforms? Work-in-progress The White House pointed us to a "consistency plan" negotiated as part of the TPP, titled the "United States — Vietnam Plan for the Enhancement of Trade and Labour Relations." Key to the plan is the decoupling of labor unions from the government. Workers must be allowed to spontaneously form a grassroots labour union. The union must be registered, but not affiliated with, the government, thus allowing it to operate by its own rules and procedures. "Vietnam shall ensure that its law does not mandate a labour union registered with the competent government body to operate according to the Statutes of Vietnam General Confederation of Labour," the plan states. Experts we spoke to said the term "unprecedented" is valid. "The workers can form their own unions," said K. William Watson, a trade policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "That's going to be a big change for Vietnam just because of the way it currently regulates labor unions. It’s not going to be compatible with the TPP at all." John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said independent unions are the first step to having workers enforce their own rights. "This other stuff about minimum wage and working ours, all of that, is meaningless if you don’t have unions," he said. "Without unions, without the capacity to organize, whatever workers’ rights are written down on paper don’t have teeth." Changes to labor laws are still going through the country’s legislative process, they said. While acknowledging that might be the case, Sifton said Obama’s claim was "premature" for suggesting current changes. "They’ve signed up to a whole lot of things and if President Obama had simply said, ‘Vietnam has promised and must do a whole bunch of things under the TPP,’ then he would have been perfectly accurate," Sifton noted. "But he made it sound like Vietnam has already started to do things and that’s just not true." Enforcement Changing the law is one thing, but actually implementing it is another. Prior to the TPP entering into force, Vietnam must change its labor code to correspond with the side agreement, the White House explained. The plan also provides a review mechanism after-the-fact whereby the United States can impose higher tariffs on Vietnam if the provisions are not being implemented. Nonetheless, experts questioned both the likelihood of Vietnam implementing the new rules and of the United States enforcing them. Both Sifton and Watson noted America’s poor track record in enforcing other free trade agreements’ labor provisions. "They have a terrible record of enforcing labor chapters as evidenced by the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Colombian Free Trade Agreement," Sifton said. "So he says they’re enforceable and that’s true on paper and its true technically, but it doesn’t mean it would be be enforced." Watson, on the other hand, said it is in Vietnam’s economic interest — due to their significant gains from the TPP — to abide by the proposed legal changes. In order to attract investors, they have to follow the rules and won’t be too antagonistic to the agreement, he explained. "It’s not a situation where this was something that they didn’t want and now they’re going to try to sidestep it," he said. "Vietnam is — economically — the country that will benefit the most from the TPP." Vague language in the consistency plan could also hinder implementation, said Angie Ngoc Tran, a professor at California State University. In an article in New Mandala, she criticized the deal for not offering enough protection for independent unions and other procedural issues. On the flip side, Cathleen Cimino-Isaacs at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the TPP has made progress to address past failures. The Peterson Institute for International Economics has been described as a pro-trade economic policy group. "Although the TPP does not address all the concerns of labor rights advocates, it represents an important step forward," Cimino-Isaacs wrote. "The bilateral plans negotiated alongside the TPP are a major innovative component, targeted to address the substandard labor conditions of most concern. Implementation of the mandated reforms would deliver signiﬁcant improvements in Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The monitoring mechanisms attached to Vietnam’s plan in particular seem more proactive than past U.S. efforts." Our ruling Obama said "Vietnam is drafting and presenting unprecedented labor reforms" and is "changing their constitution to recognize worker organizations in Vietnam for the first time." There are some problems with the claim. Experts said actual changes to the law have not happened yet but acknowledged the drafting process might be underway. They did agree, however, that the changes proposed would qualify as "unprecedented." More critically, they said it’s hard to enforce the changes being described and the United States has a particularly poor track record of doing so. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0b4621f6-693f-412e-9d5f-d66f11d089be (Update Aug. 5: This fact-check was updated to include Cimino-Isaacs' comments.)

pomt-10341	Obama "voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the (immigration overhaul) legislation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/17/john-mccain/killing-the-bill-or-making-it-better/	Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have similar views on how to fix the nation's immigration laws. But that isn't preventing them from exchanging blame for holding up progress on the issue. McCain used a July 14, 2008, appearance at the National Council of La Raza convention to tout his work on immigration reform and fire a broadside at his Democratic rival. He depicted Obama as an obstructionist who helped derail congressional efforts to enact an overhaul package last year. McCain alluded to the political risk he took last year as a Republican presidential candidate by joining forces with liberal icon Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others in promoting a compromise Senate immigration package. Then, he portrayed Obama as a politician willing to put short-term political gains ahead of substantive policymaking. "I (helped draft the compromise bill) not just because I believed it was the right thing to do for Hispanic Americans. It was the right thing to do for all Americans," McCain said before the nation's largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. "Sen. Obama declined to cast some of those tough votes. He voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the legislation, amendments that Sen. Kennedy and I voted against." Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, a McCain supporter, made similar charges in a July 11 conference call with reporters, saying Obama offered an amendment that bill supporters regarded as a "poison pill" for the way it would have terminated a temporary worker program. McCain and Martinez were referring to a series of votes the Senate took in early June 2007 at a particularly sensitive time in the immigration debate. A months-long effort to pass an overhaul bill that would have combined border security and enforcement measures with a temporary worker program had become caught in a stalemate between Democratic and Republican leaders over how much time to spend trying to amend the measure. The tension was exacerbated by a Memorial Day deadline that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set for holding a final vote. Reid ultimately extended the debate into June, giving in to GOP demands. A key point of contention was a temporary worker program and a plan to allow millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States, work in the country and ultimately earn citizenship. President Bush campaigned in 2000 on the issue and had reached out to Democrats after they gained control of Congress. Some conservative Republicans criticized the so-called "path to citizenship" provisions, believing the best remedy was for Bush and Congress to address years of failed promises made by the federal government for stepped-up border enforcement. With the GOP divided, Democrats had little desire to boost the fortunes of a weakened president. And Democrats themselves were under pressure from their allies in organized labor, which opposed guest worker provisions. The result was that the Senate took up a politically fragile compromise package whose fate could have been threatened by any number of amendments. On June 6, Obama took aim at one component of the citizenship provisions, proposing to terminate after five years a new merit-based system for awarding green cards that confer permanent resident status. The merit-based system would have apportioned green cards based on the nation's economic needs and moved away from the existing system, which rewards family ties. A coalition of 40 immigrant rights groups, including La Raza, endorsed Obama's measure, saying the new system would discriminate in favor of immigrants with higher educations and training in specialty occupations. However, the Senate rejected Obama's amendment, 42-55. Hours later, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., successfully offered an amendment to terminate the temporary worker program after five years. Dorgan contended the program would have the effect of bringing cheap labor in through the back door and squeezing out American workers. In spite of pleas from Kennedy, who said Congress should give the program a chance to work, the Senate adopted the amendment in a 49-48 vote, with Obama siding with Dorgan. Republicans like McCain who helped write the compromise immigration overhaul regarded the guest work provisions as essential and branded Dorgan's effort a "deal-breaker." But as they tried to undo the damage, Reid took steps to pull the bill from consideration and end the debate. The legislation collapsed amid three failed votes to cut off debate on June 7. Immigration experts say Obama was one of a host of senators who tried to influence the package, but was not a pivotal participant in the debate. "McCain drove comprehensive immigration reform legislation and bucked his party knowing full well what the consequences would be. Obama was a player, but he was nothing like the central player McCain was in either 2006 or 2007," said Tamar Jacoby, president and chief executive officer of ImmigrationWorks USA, a Washington-based advocacy group advancing immigration reform. Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, said Obama's amendment put Senate Democrats in a particularly tough bind, because it would have scrapped a Bush administration points-based system of awarding green cards based on family ties. Yet adopting it would have greatly complicated prospects for the plan co-authored by Kennedy, one of the party's icons. "There's no black or white answer on it," Kelley said. "If you want to say Obama was offering that kind of an amendment (poison pill), the Republicans would say, sure, because they had a lot of control in what got to the heart of the bill. If you also want to say Obama wanted a sober debate about what made sense for the immigration bill, he did that, too. It was like an optical illusion, the same picture seen two ways." Kelley said Dorgan's amendment was bitterly opposed by business interests and went to the heart of the bipartisan plan. "They described the Dorgan amendment as a poison pill at that time," she said. It's a fact that Obama's actions came at a critical point in the immigration debate and threatened a fragile political compromise. And he supported Dorgan's amendment, which was considered the poison pill McCain describes. But it's not accurate to describe Obama's amendment in the same terms. It addressed what many experts viewed as a central component of any viable immigration reform package. McCain and his camp are exaggerating Obama's role by portraying him as a giant-slayer without offering any proof Obama was intent on killing the entire package. For these reasons, we deem McCain's claim Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-17T00:00:00	2008-07-14	['None']

pomt-00620	Says Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has stated that supporting the "right to health care ... means you believe in slavery."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/27/sarah-silverman/did-rand-paul-equate-right-health-care-slavery/	Comedian Sarah Silverman’s liberal leanings are almost as well-known as her raunchy style. Her 2008 pro-Barack Obama video "The Great Schlep" attracted 2.2 million views on YouTube; a follow-up from 2012 attracted another 1.1 million views. Recently, a reader forwarded us this shareable meme from Silverman’s feed at WhoSay, a social media site, that’s critical of presidential candidate and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The meme -- which Silverman had passed along from the Twitter account of actor Michael Sheen -- shows Paul seated at a congressional hearing. The meme purports to quote Paul equating the right to health care with slavery. What do the facts say? We were able to track down the source of the comments. They stem from a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions subcommittee hearing on May 11, 2011. Paul’s unusual comparison attracted a flurry of media attention at the time, as well as sniping by Paul’s critics. The meme shortened Paul’s comments to fit the available space, but the abridgement doesn’t strike us as twisting the gist of his comments. Here’s the full excerpt: "With regard to the idea of whether you have a right to health care, you have to realize what that implies. It’s not an abstraction. I’m a physician. That means you have a right to come to my house and conscript me. It means you believe in slavery. It means that you’re going to enslave not only me, but the janitor at my hospital, the person who cleans my office, the assistants who work in my office, the nurses. "Basically, once you imply a belief in a right to someone’s services, do you have a right to plumbing? Do you have a right to water? Do you have right to food? You’re basically saying you believe in slavery. You’re saying you believe in taking and extracting from another person. Our founding documents were very clear about this. You have a right to pursue happiness but there’s no guarantee of physical comfort. There’s no guarantee of concrete items. In order to give something concrete, you have to take it from someone. So there’s an implied threat of force. "If I’m a physician in your community and you say you have a right to health care, do you have a right to beat down my door with the police, escort me away and force me to take care of you? That’s ultimately what the right to free health care would be. If you believe in a right to health care, you’re believing in basically the use of force to conscript someone to do your bidding." A few days after the speech, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a free-market group, posted a longer version of Paul’s speech on YouTube, suggesting that the next 30 seconds or so provided more nuance to Paul’s comments and had been overlooked by commentators. Here is the additional comment: "Now just because it's a noble thing to believe that we are obligated as Christians, we are obligated to the Hippocratic Oath, we have always done this. Since the beginning of modern medicine we have always provided 100 percent access. I do it in exchange for privileges. I do it because I believe in the Hippocratic Oath. But my hospital also says to me you can only operate in this hospital if you agree to see everyone coming through the emergency room. I always have. People have always had 100 percent access to our emergency room. Those are for emergencies -- those are not the best place for primary care." We don’t think Paul’s subsequent comments greatly change what he said earlier, since he’s saying he’s consenting to the servitude of treating non-paying patients as a condition of being allowed to practice at certain hospitals. In this comment, he still sees it as a burden to be borne. In addition, Paul says he’s referring to emergency-room care, not to primary care. Primary care was the point of getting uninsured Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act, so they wouldn’t have to resort to going to emergency rooms for basic services. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- who, as it happens, is also running for president in 2016 -- used his perch as the chairman of the subcommittee to ask a witness, physician Dana Kraus, whether she felt like a "slave" working at her federally qualified health center. "I love my job," she responded. "I do not feel like a slave." Even Matt Welch, the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, had harsh words for Paul, who has long been identified with the libertarian movement. "Could slaves free themselves by changing professions?" Welch wrote. "Do doctors in Switzerland get taken away at gunpoint? To treat the analogy with technical seriousness, even setting aside (as if you could) the colossal weight of America's most lasting shame, is to render it ridiculous, in my opinion." We could not find an instance of Paul addressing these comments further, and Paul’s staff didn’t respond to a pair of inquiries. Our ruling Silverman forwarded a social media meme that said Paul has stated that supporting the "right to health care … means you believe in slavery." The meme has been abridged from the full quote, but we see no significant change in his meaning. We also found no evidence that Paul had backtracked on the views he expressed. We rate the meme’s claim True.	None	Sarah Silverman	None	None	None	2015-05-27T15:02:01	2015-05-22	['None']

pomt-09645	A recent drop in the unemployment rate is questionable because it was calculated "over two days of the Thanksgiving week."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/10/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-unemployment-drop-was-skewed-thanksg/	On his Dec. 8, 2009, radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh mocked President Barack Obama's claim that the job market is stabilizing. Limbaugh played a tape of Obama giving a speech on the economy and jobs earlier that morning at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "Finally," Obama said, "we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact, we learned on Friday (Dec. 4) that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month." Then Limbaugh interrupts. "Stop the tape. That's because the figures were taken over two days of the Thanksgiving week where people were not working, were not looking for work, were not filing claims and so this -- wait 'til that number is revised. Wait 'til the number ends up being revised. It's going to go up." To determine whether the timing of a holiday could disrupt a long-standing federal statistic, we'll start by looking at the figures Obama was referring to. The numbers released Dec. 4 were the ones that most people think of whenever they think of unemployment statistics -- namely, the "unemployment rate" as calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics using the Current Population Survey. Using in-person and phone interviews, Labor Department officials track a sampling of households to determine each member's status in the work force, then use that raw data to help calculate the unemployment rate. On Dec. 4, officials announced that unemployment in November had edged downward, to 10.0 from 10.2 percent in October. That is the slight fall that the president referenced in his speech. But experts say this data couldn't have been skewed by Thanksgiving week, for two reasons. First, the Current Population Survey interviews always refer to someone's employment status during week that includes the 12th of the month. This November, that was the week of Monday, Nov. 9, to Friday, Nov. 13 -- two weeks before Thanksgiving. Second, the data from the Current Population Survey is "seasonally adjusted." That means that before the numbers are released, officials adjust them to smooth out any fluctuations caused by the calendar. Even though the term "seasonally adjusted" makes it sound as if officials only adjust the numbers to reflect variations tied to winter, spring, summer and fall, the adjustments also take into account factors that could make a particular week an oddity. The Labor Department and economists say that the seasonal adjustments are based on well-established trends and would take into account any quirks from the presence of a holiday during the data-collection week. So Limbaugh is incorrect that the unemployment rate cited by Obama could have been skewed by what was happening during Thanksgiving week. That said, Limbaugh's assertion isn't entirely out of left (or right) field. There's another unemployment statistic that typically gets some coverage in the media, though less than the unemployment rate: the number of initial jobless claims. This statistic is compiled by a different part of the Labor Department -- the Employment and Training Administration -- and reflects all available data on residents who are applying for unemployment insurance for the first time. And this year, just a day before the unemployment rate was announced, an initial jobless claims number was released ... using statistics collected during Thanksgiving week (although not just on two days of that week, as Limbaugh said). As it happened, those numbers fell slightly as well. Some economists say that having a holiday fall during the data collection week is at least a potential problem for statistical reliability. Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist and managing director of Mesirow Financial Holdings Inc., said that the survey's reliance on 50 different state agencies for data makes it somewhat more susceptible to anomalies, such as the timing of a holiday. But the numbers for the initial jobless claims, like the Current Population Survey figures, are seasonally adjusted, based on the Labor Department's years of experience with recurring patterns. So the fact that Thanksgiving fell during this week should not make a difference with this data, either. One final note: On Dec. 10, 2009, the initial jobless claims numbers for the week ending Dec. 5 were released, and they were higher than they were the previous week. Limbaugh can perhaps take a measure of vindication, but it should not obscure the fact that his claim of holiday bias is incorrect. Skepticism about the seasonal adjustment methodology could lead someone to believe that the initial jobless claim numbers were skewed by the holiday week. But it would be a stretch for Limbaugh to argue that he was referring to initial jobless claims rather than the unemployment rate. Not only is the unemployment rate the most commonly cited unemployment statistic, but Obama, in the taped lead-in, clearly refers to the "unemployment rate."

pomt-00195	Says Scott Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/18/tony-evers/scott-walker-says-he-would-cover-pre-existing-cond/	Like Democrat Tammy Baldwin against Republican Leah Vukmir in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race, Tony Evers has been hitting Scott Walker on pre-existing conditions in the governor’s race. Baldwin, the incumbent senator, claimed Vukmir supports letting insurance companies "deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions." Our rating was Half True. Join us for a free PolitiFact event in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, Evers, the Democratic nominee for governor, has made similar attacks on Walker, the two-term incumbent, ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. One attack comes in a video posted Oct. 10, 2018 in which Evers claims Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions." Let’s see what plan Evers is referring to. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Repealing Obamacare As we noted in the Baldwin fact check, at issue here is the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and its prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Under the federal law, if you don’t have health insurance from an employer or the government, you have guaranteed access to insurance in the individual market, regardless of your health, and you can’t be charged higher rates for a pre-existing condition. That blanket protection is something that is threatened by Republican efforts to repeal the law, and Walker supports repeal. For example, he backed the so-called Graham-Cassidy repeal bill, saying: "I think it’s awesome… It’s a winner all the way around." News reports said that under the bill, states could have allowed for waivers to let insurers charge sick patients higher premiums and stop covering certain benefits required under the Affordable Care Act; and that states could obtain waivers to permit insurers to charge different premiums based on health status, age or other factors. PolitiFact National, noting that Democrats across the country are attacking Republicans over pre-existing conditions, has reported that Republican proposals are not as air tight as Obamacare when it comes to pre-existing conditions. Graham-Cassidy would have allowed insurers to sell bare-bones plans with low premiums that would be attractive to healthy people, while plans that provide the coverage that sicker people need would be very expensive, our colleagues reported. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. So, repeal of Obamacare — and its protections for pre-existing conditions -- is one plan Walker supports. But there’s another. Walker also backed a lawsuit brought by Wisconsin and 19 other states that a New York Times news story said could eviscerate major parts of the Affordable Care Act and allow insurers to again deny people coverage because of their medical condition or history. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. So, Walker supports two plans, or initiatives, that would result in eliminating blanket protections for people with pre-existing conditions. To be clear, Walker hasn’t said people with pre-existing conditions shouldn’t be covered. But he hasn’t spelled out an alternative that would provide protections that Obamacare does. Walker’s response Walker has repeatedly promised to cover people with pre-existing conditions and has pledged to pass legislation to guarantee them coverage. For example, he called for such a law in his January 2018 state of the state speech. And in September 2018, he said he would call a special session of the Legislature to adopt that measure if the Affordable Care Act were blocked. The prospects for such a bill passing, however, are unclear. Moreover, Walker has provided few details on what he has in mind, raising questions about how people with pre-existing conditions would be covered. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel examined what would happen to people in Wisconsin with pre-existing conditions if Obamacare were overturned. In short, the fates of some them are uncertain. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover specific health benefits, including prescription drugs for almost every medical condition. So, without a similar requirement in state law, insurers could sidestep any requirement that they cover pre-existing health conditions. They could do this by not including some services or costly drugs in a health plan's benefits. It’s also worth noting that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool was held up as something as a model on pre-existing conditions, at least for the people it covered. But it worked only for people who could afford the insurance in the first place — and many people with pre-existing conditions could not afford coverage from the high-risk pool, as it covered fewer than 25,000 people. An estimated 852,000 people in Wisconsin have a health condition that would have led to being denied coverage in the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families before the Affordable Care Act. Our rating Evers says Walker supports "a health care plan that would gut protections for pre-existing conditions." Walker has supported two efforts that would result in elimination of blanket protections for pre-existing conditions: Legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a lawsuit that would block it. The law provides a variety of protections to people with pre-existing medical conditions — including prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to those people and prohibiting them from charging those people higher rates. So, getting rid of Obamacare would eliminate those protections. Walker has pledged that if Obamacare is repealed, he would seek legislation to guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But it’s not clear how that legislation would compare to Obamacare and not clear if it could pass the Legislature. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-11600	"We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-again-recent-tax-bill-biggest-e/	President Donald Trump repeated in his State of the Union address one of his most frequent talking points — and one that has been repeatedly debunked. "We enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history," Trump said in his address. Measuring the size of the tax cut is a straightforward task. And as we noted the last time we fact-checked a similar claim, the tax bill passed last December doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. On the eve of its passage, the Joint Committee on Taxation — Congress’s nonpartisan arbiter of tax analysis — said the tax bill would cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year. How does that compare historically? The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax bill Inflation-adjusted dollars (per year) American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) $321 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 $210 billion Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 $208 billion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 $150 billion By this measurement, the recent tax bill ranks as the fourth-biggest since 1940. The Trump-signed legislation falls lower on the list when the cuts are ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax bill Percentage of GDP Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 1.6 percent Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 1.31 percent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 0.9 percent By this measurement, the recent tax bill ranked seventh. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut from 1921, not included in the Treasury Department analysis, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that "if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years." Our ruling Trump said, "we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history." In inflation-adjusted dollars, the recent tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh. We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-01-30T21:24:30	2018-01-30	['United_States']

pomt-01808	"Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/23/pat-buchanan/pat-buchanan-right-now-one-third-all-illegal-alien/	The Golden State went from red to blue thanks to an influx of immigrants, which is a cautionary tale for the national conservative agenda, says GOP pundit Pat Buchanan. On July 17, 2014, on Fox’s The Sean Hannity Show, Buchanan noted that California Republicans are now outnumbered 2 to 1 in the state Legislature, 2 to 1 one in Congress, and that no Republican holds a statewide office. "Right now, one third of all the illegal aliens go to California. Take a look at California politically, which Richard Nixon carried five times and Ronald Reagan carried in four landslides," he said. "And when the country looks like California demographically, it’s gonna look like California politically." We wanted to check Buchanan’s claim that a third of the country’s unauthorized immigrants are Cali-bound. To the redwood forests Buchanan did not respond when we asked where he got his numbers, so we can’t know for sure. There’s really no good data on immediate destinations -- where unauthorized immigrants are going initially -- according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. He said that though immigrants are more mobile than native-born residents, the general trend is that fewer immigrants are going to California first. There’s also no way to know exactly how many unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, wrote Kevin Johnson, the dean of public interest law at the University of California-Davis. Most reports and experts agree that the number is somewhere between 11 and 12 million. So based on the estimates we have, where are unauthorized immigrants living? In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 25 percent of unauthorized immigrants live in California. Texas came in second with 16 percent. The estimates rely on U.S. Census Bureau data, which attempts to measure everyone living in the country, measured against data on legal immigrants from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. The Department of Homeland Security warns in its report that its state-to-state estimates may be affected by state-to-state migration (i.e. someone lives in California at the time of the Census but moved elsewhere later). Another report, from Pew, has a slightly lower estimate. In 2013, Pew reported that 21 percent of the nation’s unauthorized immigrants lived in California, a rate that Pew says has held steady since 2010. That’s a sharp decline from 1990, when Pew said that 42 percent of all unauthorized immigrants lived in California. Texas came in second in this report as well, at 14.5 percent. Both these reports, we should note, measure where unauthorized immigrants are living. Buchanan said they are "going" there after crossing the border. "Maybe, I’m speculating here, (Buchanan’s number) can refer to the immigrants first going into California and then moving to other states? I haven’t seen any reports that suggest that though. So most likely, he’s speaking out of his butt," said Manuel Pastor, co-director of the University of Southern California’s Center for the Study of Immigration Integration. While California is taking in more unauthorized immigrants than other states, its share has been dropping, experts say. Passel said this is because of the state’s recession in the mid 1990s, which led to immigrants seeking jobs in "new destination areas" such as Texas. Historically, because immigrants are attracted to the United States for employment opportunities, the Golden State has always been a top choice, especially for unauthorized immigrants seeking niche labor opportunities. "California has a large economy with many jobs, including the agricultural, construction, and service industries, which have attracted undocumented workers," Johnson said. In addition to geographic proximity, the rise of the service sector and low-wage manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s made Los Angeles a mecca for immigrants, Pastor said. And since most immigration is "chain immigration," immigrants tend to head for California. "Their families are already there. Their friends are there," Pastor said. "Many undocumented immigrants have been in America longer than 10 years. There’s a tendency to think this is a shallowly rooted population. But these immigrants are deeply immersed in their communities." Party lines Though not specifically part of this fact-check, it’s important to note that Buchanan is mixing apples and oranges when he suggests unauthorized immigrants are directly affecting election outcomes. Unauthorized immigrants cannot vote. Neither can legal immigrants until they are naturalized. And there are almost no reports in California of unlawful voting by noncitizens, according to Johnson. "California’s racial ethnic makeup has certainly changed. But still, a lot of its legal immigrants aren’t citizens, let alone unauthorized immigrants," said Passel. The one situation that most directly could affect an election would be if two unauthorized parents have a child in the United States. That child would be a legal U.S. citizen and would be eligible to vote when they turn 18. On politics, it’s hard to see a direct correlation simply between the number of unauthorized immigrants and election results. California voted Republican for president from 1968-88 and has voted Democrat from 1992-2012. Of the state’s last six elected governors, three were Republican and three were Democrat. In Texas, which has the second-highest share of unauthorized immigrants, Republicans have won the last nine presidential elections and served as governor for 27 out of the past 35 years. The ruling Buchanan said, "Right now, one third of all illegal aliens are going to California." While experts say no good account for initial destinations of unauthorized immigrants exists, the most reliable estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in California range between 21 and 25 percent. That’s a bit lower than what Buchanan said. As a result, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Pat Buchanan	None	None	None	2014-07-23T11:30:15	2014-07-17	['California']

pomt-14121	Twenty million Americans are "out of work."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/09/tom-marino/pa-congressman-tom-marino-says-20-million-american/	U.S. Rep. Tom Marino took to MSNBC to defend presumptive GOP Presidential nominee Donald Trump, and cited an eye-opening number of unemployed Americans in the process. Marino, a Republican who represents Pennsylvania’s 10th district, endorsed Trump in February, saying the decision was "one of my life-changing moments," according to Politico. He appeared Thursday on MSNBC to defend the real estate mogul’s record and assert Trump, who’s never held elected office before, is the best person for the job. "To those that are saying that this just isn’t going to work, let me ask you this question: How’s it been working the last 30 years with governors and senators and career politicians being president?" he asked. "We’re 20 trillion dollars in debt, 20 million people out of work, businesses leaving the country, people are afraid that they can’t even send their kids to college." The idea that 20 million people are out of work in America sounded high, especially because the official number of unemployed Americans was 8 million as of April 1, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So we decided to check the fact. Marino’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment from PolitiFact, but we’ve looked into this claim before. Former presidential candidate John Kasich actually cited the 20 million figure in a campaign ad in February, and when PolitiFact asked the Kasich campaign for evidence, they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to an even earlier fact check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that "we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are "out of work" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job." And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as "out of work" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: Unemployed: 7.8 million People who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job": 6.2 million People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million. That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of "out of work" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had "some justification" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: "We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent." But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about the use of the 20 million figure? "Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being "out of work." Burtless agreed, saying, "The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire." At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. He called a the 20 million figure "an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed." It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Marino said on MSNBC that 20 million Americans are out of work. While the statement can be interpreted as accurate depending on the definition of "out of work," it lacks context.

pomt-13271	Says Colorado congressional candidate Morgan Carroll "voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/13/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-morgan-carroll-voted-let-welfare-recipients-u/	A Republican group has launched a racy ad saying Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll, a Democratic congressional candidate, voted to allow welfare recipients to use public benefit cards at ATMs in strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries. The National Republican Congressional Committee’s ad shows how down and dirty the race between Carroll and Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman is getting in the final sprint to Election Day. They’re fighting over suburban Denver’s 6th Congressional District, one of the nation’s most competitive swing districts. "Career politicians waste lots of money. Morgan Carroll is one of the worst," the narrator says at the beginning of the ad, titled "Clubs." "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries," the narrator continues as the video shifts from Carroll addressing the Legislature to her standing at a podium in front of a red neon silhouette of a nude female figure and the words "STRIPPERS" and "MORGAN CARROLL" on a brick wall. There's a row of marijuana-filled jars beside the senator. "It's enough to make you ask, 'What's Morgan Carroll thinking?' Welfare for lap dances? Morgan Carroll is careless with our money," the ad concludes. We examined the claim that "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries." The facts are fairly straightforward. Carroll was among a dozen Democratic senators who voted against final passage of a 2015 bill to prohibit welfare recipients from using state-issued electronic benefit transfer (or EBT) cards to obtain cash from ATMs at pot shops and strip clubs. Low-income families use these debit cards to buy "essential goods" such as food and clothing and to help pay for utilities and rent. Senate Bill 65, which became law, expanded on existing state law prohibiting people from using the cards to withdraw ATM cash at liquor stores, casinos and gun shops. Federal law already required states to prevent people receiving public benefits from using EBT cards at liquor stores, gambling and adult entertainment venues. Colorado also has had trouble preventing people from withdrawing ATM cash totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos and liquor stores, according to Watchdog.org. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado would face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against EBT card use at strip clubs. There were also concerns about a federal crackdown after several reports of people using the benefit cards at shops selling medical or recreational marijuana -- a drug that’s legal under state law but illegal under federal law. "We stand to lose a lot if we don't show we are trying" to prevent the use of tax money for marijuana, Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, a primary sponsor of the bill, told the Associated Press last year. "The growers here put in a lot of time and effort. A raid would be absolutely devastating to our state." Why did Carroll -- along with many other Democratic senators -- vote against the bill? "The reason she voted against it was because of 'banking deserts,' where many poor people don't have" bank ATMs in their neighborhoods, said Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich. Removing their ability to get cash from ATMs at the many marijuana dispensaries that dot Colorado cities and towns hampers low-income families’ ability to access money to purchase legitimate products elsewhere, he added. According to the Atlantic magazine, a March study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the increase of "banking deserts" found that "lower-income communities and communities of color have historically and disproportionately limited access to mainstream banking services." This makes it harder for people in these communities to manage their finances and build wealth, the study said. Democratic lawmakers had repeatedly defeated similar legislation, arguing that improper ATM withdrawals at strip clubs, liquor stores, casinos represent a tiny fraction of the total use of cash-assistance cards, the Denver Post reported. Critics also note that the 2015 law doesn't prevent someone on welfare from using their EBT card to make a withdrawal at a supermarket ATM and then go spend the cash at a pot shop or a strip club. Our ruling NRCC says, "Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries." There's slightly more to this than the NRCC lets on: Carroll voted, unsuccessfully, to allow welfare recipients to continue withdrawing money from ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries. Carroll’s spokesman said the senator voted against the bill that prohibited people from using public benefit cards for cash withdrawals at strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries because she was concerned about the impact on residents of poor neighborhoods where there are few -- if any -- banking services. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado could face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against the use of benefit cards at adult entertainment venues.

pomt-05925	A proposed mine in Wisconsin is "about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/30/penny-bernard-schaber/wisconsin-democrat-says-proposed-mine-would-be-nea/	Would a proposed iron ore mine in Wisconsin be nearly the size of one of the nation’s largest inland lakes? About an hour into an 11-hour legislative hearing on Jan. 11, 2012, state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, worried aloud about environmental damage such an operation might cause. The second-term Assembly member compared the mine to Lake Winnebago, the largest of Wisconsin’s 15,000 inland lakes and one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in the U.S. "That's a very large lake that's right at the end of the area that I represent, extremely large lake. And from what I've tried to figure out on the central size of this mine, it could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago," Bernard Schaber said. "And Lake Winnebago, I encourage you to go there. I’ve ridden my bike around it and it’s a hundred miles-plus to ride your bike around the lake." Size would help determine whether the mine would help create thousands of jobs, as its supporters contend, as well as what impact it would have on land and water. So let’s see if Bernard Schaber’s comparison measures up. Billion-dollar mine News surfaced in November 2010 that Gogebic Taconite proposed to spend more than $1 billion to develop an open-pit iron ore mine more than 300 miles northwest of Milwaukee in far northern Wisconsin. It would take years to open the mine, if various government approvals are won. Gogebic Taconite hasn’t made a formal proposal to the state as it waits to see whether Assembly Bill 426, which has generated lobbying activity by 34 organizations, becomes law. The bill, which would relax environmental standards and public participation in the review process for the mine, was approved Jan. 26, 2012 by the Republican-controlled Assembly, with Bernard Schaber and every other Democrat in attendance voting no. Gogebic president Bill Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the company would need up to 5,000 acres to encompass the mine -- roughly four miles long and a half-mile wide -- and facilities such as roads, waste-rock storage and ore processing. That would be nowhere near two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago, which has an area of about 138,000 acres. We sought out a state mine expert and spoke with Ann Coakley, director of the waste and materials management bureau of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. She noted Gogebic has spoken about a possibly wider mine -- 1.5 miles wide rather than a half-mile. But even at that, she estimated that the total footprint likely would be 10,000 acres. That, too, is much less than two-thirds the area of Lake Winnebago. Lawmaker's evidence So, does Bernard Schaber have evidence that the mine would be two-thirds as big as the lake? No and yes. Legislative aide Eric Koch said his boss believes the space needed for the related facilities, added to the mine itself, would make the total footprint two-thirds the size of the lake. But he acknowledged she has no solid data to support that estimate. In a written summary and other documents Bernard Schaber provided to back up her claim, she introduced a different measurement: volume. She starts with the dimensions of Lake Winnebago, citing a DNR document. If we round the figures Bernard Schaber cites, the lake has an area of nearly 138,000 acres, which is about 6 billion square feet. She multiplies 6 billion square feet by the lake’s average depth of 15.5 feet, for a total of 93 billion cubic feet. Now to the size of the mine. Noting that Gogebic Taconite has given varying dimensions of what the size of the mine itself might be, Bernard Schaber used a length of 4.5 miles and a width of three-quarters of a mile. That comes to 3.375 square miles or about 94 million square feet. She multiplies that figure by 1,000 feet, which has been the reported depth of the mine, to come up with a total of 94 billion cubic feet -- a volume even larger than Lake Winnebago’s. Gogebic Taconite’s Williams told us the mine’s depth would range from 700 to 1,000 feet. But even if we used 700 instead of 1,000 in the equation, we’d get a mine depth of 66 billion cubic feet -- more than two-thirds the volume of Lake Winnebago. So, when depth is added to length and width, the mine is at or near the size of the lake. But at the hearing Bernard Schaber -- who spoke of biking around the lake -- was clearly referring to area, not volume. Our rating Bernard Schaber said "the central size" of a mine proposed for far northern Wisconsin "could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago." There’s an element of truth in her statement, in terms of volume. But she lacks evidence to back her central claim, which was area. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-15194	"The annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/18/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigrants-four-two-billion/	After weeks of incendiary rhetoric on illegal immigration, Donald Trump unveiled his official policy plan on what is arguably the central issue of his campaign on Aug. 16. Highlights of the plan include deporting all undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship and "making Mexico pay for the wall." "For many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country," the position page on Trump’s website reads. "The costs for the United States have been extraordinary. ... Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011." The $4.2 billion figure caught our eye. Though Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us, we found a 2011 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that corroborates his claim. Nonetheless, Trump confuses a few points. In 2009 (not, as Trump says, in 2011), "individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits, according to the report. That’s indeed more than four times the amount in 2005 ($924 million). How did this happen? Although undocumented immigrants can’t get a Social Security Number, they can file taxes with a different nine-digit number, the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number or ITIN. Experts told us that illegal immigrants make up the vast majority of ITIN filers, though there’s no way of knowing just how many. The group also includes legal immigrants (refugees, asylum seekers, spouses), foreign workers (professors, technology workers, people who own businesses in America but live abroad), and dependents of both citizens and immigrants. Regardless of immigration status, ITIN filers are not eligible for Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, undocumented immigrants doled out an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes but will never get the benefits. Also, ITIN filers can’t get the Earned Income Tax Credit, due to a provision in a 1996 law. ITIN filers, however, can receive the Additional Child Tax Credit, a refund given to people who owed less in taxes than deductions they could receive through the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). The credit as it stands today was established in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, one of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Unlike in 1996, Congress did not write a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the refund. As a result, claims for the additional child credit have increased significantly since 2001, according to the Treasury Inspector General audit. By 2009, 2.3 million ITIN filers received $4.2 billion through the additional child credit, a four-fold increase over 2005. Here’s a chart from the audit: Under this current system for ITIN filers, "the government isn’t losing out," according to Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It gets more money in revenues than it gives out in credits. However, Greenstein told us it’s slightly misleading to say that the recipients of the child credit are illegal immigrants. "The vast majority of that $4.2 billion, the filer may be undocumented, but you have to have a child to receive it. And the children are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens," he said. In other words, the $4.2 billion in tax credits largely benefits American-born children, whose parents are admittedly undocumented immigrants. Trump’s immigration plan actually addresses this potential issue: He calls for an end to birthright citizenship. "So his position is pretty consistent," pointed out Greenstein. Our ruling Trump said, "The annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011." Based on an audit by the Treasury Inspector General, the claim leaves out some context. Trump conflates "illegal immigrants" with "unauthorized workers," a group composed largely of undocumented immigrants but also legal immigrants and others. The $4.2 billion refers to the amount given in tax credit refunds for children, the large majority of whom are U.S. citizens. And the actual year is 2009, not 2011 (that was the year the report was published). Also, it's important to note that illegal immigrants pay an estimated $12 billion in payroll taxes to Social Security and don't receive benefits. So Trump is leaving out a significant part of the picture when it comes to taxes and undocumented workers. Overall, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03948	"Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education."	true	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/19/eric-cantor/cantor-says-states-are-spending-more-medicaid-publ/	House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is urging lawmakers to make Medicaid more flexible, effective and cheaper for states to run. "Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals," he said during his Feb. 5 "Make Life Work" speech at a conservative think tank in Washington "Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education." We looked into the claim that states are paying more for Medicaid than public education. Cantor’s staff told us the information came from a report, published by the National Association of State Budget Officers last fall, that tallied where states get and spend their money. The study found that states planned to spend a total $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012. Of the sum, 39.8 percent would come from general fund moneys that are collected through statewide taxes, 31.2 percent from federal grants and the remaining 29 percent from other state funds and bonds. Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, was expected to be the most expensive item in the collective state budgets. States were projected to spend $406 billion on the service, or 23.9 percent of their total budgets. Elementary and secondary education came in second, drawing $336 billion, or 19.8 percent of total expenses. But there’s a catch to these figures: The federal government provides states with about 56 percent of what they spend on Medicaid, according to NASBO report. So Cantor is including as state expenses about $228 billion that Uncle Sam sends to the states for Medicaid. The picture changes if we simply examine the portions of Medicaid and public education that states pay out of their general funds. Public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7 percent of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant No. 2, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6 percent of general fund outlays. Experts we spoke to didn’t express a preference for one accounting method or the other. "We include both methods in our report," said Stacy Mazer, senior staff associate at NASBO. "One reason we’ve been using total funds is that some states define their funds differently. And one of the other issues is that even though it’s not all your money, you’re still administering it." Tracy Gordon, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said most health care industry analysts use a total figure cited by Cantor, but note that it includes federal dollars. Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his organization tracks states’ general fund spending and considers K-12 education to be the greatest recipient of state money. Our ruling Cantor said states are spending more on Medicaid than on education. His statement is correct, although it should be noted that a substantial portion of the dollars states are spending on Medicaid come from the federal government. We rate Cantor’s statement True.

pomt-02508	On repealing the 17th Amendment	full flop	/texas/statements/2014/feb/13/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-went-unequivocally-support-would-not-b/	"Flip flop," begins a Jan. 22, 2014, news blog entry from the San Antonio Express-News. "That’s exactly what Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, both trying to capture the tea party vote in the Republican primary, did earlier this week when posed a question about repealing the 17th Amendment." The 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1913, did away with state legislatures electing U.S. senators and handed that power directly to the people. It begins, "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote." At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post and an Oct. 16 Statesman news story. But tea party activists, particularly in Texas, describe it as a mistake that reduced state power by undoing an intended balance between U.S. representatives elected locally by the people and U.S. senators more accountable to state legislators. Another Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Texas land commissioner Jerry Patterson, said in a Waco Tribune-Herald interview published Feb. 2 and in subsequent emails to us that Patrick and Dewhurst each said in an Oct. 3 debate that he favored repeal, then changed his tune at a Jan. 20 King Street Patriots debate. Patterson and another GOP candidate, Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples, who weren’t asked about repeal at the October debate, each said at the later debate that he opposes repealing the amendment, according to a YouTube video that King Street spokesman Logan Churchwell told us by phone accurately presented the candidates’ responses. To gauge whether Dewhurst and Patrick flip-flopped, we reviewed the cited debates, checked news accounts and reached out to their respective campaigns. (Our check of Dewhurst’s statements is here.) An Oct. 10 Statesman news blog post quoted Patrick as saying at the Oct. 3 debate held in Houston by the Clear Lake Tea Party: "I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment and the restoration of our Founders' original intent to have the state legislatures select our United States senators. ... It is absolutely necessary that the 17th Amendment be repealed to revitalize our republican system of government." At the Jan. 20 King Street debate in Houston, according to the YouTube video, Patrick said: "I think this came up in a debate about four months ago. We’ve had many debates. And I think either I misspoke or I was misquoted or it was reported incorrectly; I’m not sure which. ... I would not be in position to support repealing it today. I was just taking a historical view of it and I think that was a turning point; it hasn’t worked out, I think, as planned, but I would not be in favor of repealing it." Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that there was "No flip. Dan just doesn't think now is the time to have that fight." We asked how this "not now" position coheres with Patrick flatly saying at the January debate that he is not in favor of repeal. Spence replied that as a candidate for lieutenant governor, Patrick is not positioned to lead the charge for repeal "now or in the near future." He also said, "This must be my last time to address this." Our ruling Between the October and January debates, Patrick shifted from saying "I unequivocally support the repeal of the 17th Amendment" to "I would not be in favor of repealing it." Given an opportunity to explain the contrast, his campaign said Patrick wouldn’t be positioned as lieutenant governor to lead the repeal charge and that there would be no further clarification. Our sense is that Patrick himself said he was for repeal, then said he is not. That’s a Full Flop. FULL FLOP -- A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop.

pomt-14107	Germany "is crime-riddled right now" because of migration to Europe.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/	After his GOP opponents dropped out of the race, Donald Trump was asked on NBC Nightly News if he would soften his opinions on immigration. "As you try to appeal to the entire country, do you stand by them? Do you stand, for example, by the idea of a ban against foreign Muslims coming in?" asked anchor Lester Holt. "I do," said Trump. "We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. We have to see what's going on. There's a big problem in the world. You look what's happening with the migration in Europe. You look at Germany, it's crime-riddled right now." A reader asked us to check if Trump was accurately characterizing what is going on in Germany in the wake of the German government's willingness to accept migrants, particularly its decision in August to waive rules for Syrian refugees seeking sanctuary. About 1.1 million arrived last year from the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We emailed Trump's spokeswoman to ask for the source of his claim, but we didn't hear back. When something is riddled, it's filled with something undesirable. When a body is riddled with bullets, it has a lot of bullets. Without knowing the precise point at which a city is "riddled" with crime, we'll look at the data to see if Germany now has a lot of crime. Germany's crime rate, particularly violent crime, is far lower than in the United States. The U.S. murder rate, for example, is nearly six times higher than Germany's, according to the most recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Government data show that despite a 440 percent increase in migrants, crime among that group only increased by 79 percent last year. We found out that the German government has repeatedly studied the question of crime and migrants. According to the Bundeskriminalamt, also known as the Federal Criminal Police Office or BKA, crimes by immigrants rose 79 percent in 2015. But at the same time, the number of refugees in the country rose more than fivefold — by 440 percent. In other words, the typical German was more likely to engage in crime than the average migrant. Not only that, the BKA found that the increase was in the first half of 2015. The rate then leveled off during the second half of the year, the period with the greatest influx of refugees, according to the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Nonetheless, in terms of raw numbers, that's 92,000 more crimes committed by migrants than in previous years. Instances of assaults, robberies and "predatory extortion," a classification that includes threatening behavior, doubled over 2015. Smaller offenses, such as theft (mostly shoplifting), forging paperwork to get money and riding on public transport without paying the fare, nearly doubled. According to Die Welt (The World), a national German newspaper, most of the crimes committed by refugees are related to theft or trying to ride on public transport without tickets. Fewer than 1 percent, or less than 1,000, are sex crimes, in spite of social media rumors. However, concern over sex crimes peaked New Year's Eve amid widespread reports of groups of drunken North African migrants — Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco — sexually assaulting hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities. Those reports dovetailed with a 2014 study that found 40 percent of refugees from that region had gotten into legal trouble within 12 months of their arrival versus 0.5 percent of Syrians. A later analysis also revealed that migrants from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan were much less likely to be charged with a crime than migrants from other regions such as the Western Balkans, demonstrating that you can't lump all migrants together. Groups concerned about the influx of migrants believe that the government may not be giving the full story. The reports that migrants are generating less crime than other Germans have been met with some criticism. Data from a few states were not included, for example, and the New Year's Eve sexual assaults didn't make it into the latest report. It should also be noted that some of the additional crime has consisted of attacks on migrants and migrant camps. By the end of October, the number of attacks against shelters for asylum seekers had tripled compared to the count for all of 2014. When we compared the U.S. State Department's annual reports on German crime and safety from 2014 to 2016, we found that the low-to-medium risk in 2014 had, by the 2015 report, risen to a medium rating for most cities. The 2016 report specifically mentions the refugee problem: "While the 2014 statistics (the latest available) for Germany are of interest, they fail to capture any effect that the approximately 1 million refugees and asylum seekers who arrived in country in 2015 may have had on crime." It quotes some alarming statistics from the first quarter of 2015, but, as we've noted, the German government has released more up-to-date information that shows the initial refugee crime leveled off in the latter half of 2015. The crime and safety report also says, "A number of ranking police officers have questioned the accuracy of the statistics being provided, specifically related to crimes taking place within refugee camps or being committed by refugees." But overall, "To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale empirical studies that have shown a connection between large-scale immigration and spikes in crime. In fact many studies show the opposite," said Natalia Banulescu-Bogdan, assistant director of the international program at the Migration Policy Institute and a fellow at MPI Europe in Brussels. "It is important to be very careful about causation versus correlation," she said. Youth unemployment, being forced to wait while seeking asylum or trying to reunite with family members can increase tensions, but conditions such as youth unemployment can spark crime among non-migrants as well. "There is nothing to suggest, however, that there is anything specific to refugee populations in general, or to those seeking asylum in Europe in particular, that predisposes them to crime," said Banulescu-Bogdan. "In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, because there is so much more riding on their ability to avoid encounters with police and jeopardize their future in the country." Our ruling Trump said Germany "is crime-riddled right now" because of migration to Europe. There are more criminal acts in Germany these days because there are more people, thanks to the influx of 1.1 million refugees in 2015 alone. But the data suggest that the refugees tend to be better-behaved than the typical German. Even if you presume that refugee-related crime is underreported for political reasons, we could find no evidence in German media reports that the country warrants Trump's riddled-with-crime characterization. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Meist Falsch — Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/de3b3f76-de96-4103-8010-4a5d036cb6f6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-11T15:49:39	2016-05-04	['Europe', 'Germany']
pomt-02194	Says Charlie Crist's campaign bashed Sen. Bill Nelson's "big-government solutions."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/25/msnbc/msnbc-labels-florida-republican-charlie-crist-advi/	The national media is abuzz, again, about the possibility of Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., shaking up the Florida governor’s race. Nelson has repeatedly said he has no plans to enter, but he hasn’t flatly ruled out a scenario in which he enters the race if Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist appears to flame out against Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott. A new poll has Crist and Scott tied with 42 percent of the vote, while other polls generally have shown Crist ahead. On Wednesday at a luncheon with Daytona Beach business leaders, Nelson zinged Scott for rejecting high-speed rail financed by federal stimulus dollars and not pushing harder for billions of federal dollars to expand Medicaid to poor, uninsured residents. "I think it’s not only a shame," Nelson said, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. "I think it’s a moral abscess." The speech generated headlines that Nelson was toying with the idea of running. That, in turn, spawned reaction from Scott’s campaign chairman, state Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine. "His solutions are federally based solutions — not Florida-based solutions," Thrasher said in criticizing Nelson. Why are we writing about any of this at PunditFact? Because MSNBC’s Daily Rundown got it mixed up in a segment about the story featuring input from Chuck Todd from Seoul, South Korea, Tampa Bay Times political editor Adam Smith and fill-in host Kristen Welker. After Smith noted a concern among Democrats that Crist "could wind up as a train wreck," Welker noted, "Crist’s campaign is actually responding, which is interesting. He says of Bill Nelson, or his campaign chairman says, ‘His solutions are federally based solutions — not Florida-based solutions.’ So Crist really feeling the heat here, pushing back. What do you make of that?" A chart also wrongly referred to Thrasher as Crist’s campaign chairman. This is the same man who just this week released a statement saying, "We are very confident in our campaign to show Charlie Crist's failure as governor in contrast to Gov. Scott's record of job creation." The segment prompted Crist adviser Kevin Cate to tweet, "Correction for @dailyrundown: @John_Thrasher is not our chair & we didn't bash Nelson. cc: @chucktodd @adamsmithtimes pic.twitter.com/149Etntdyq" After we began reporting this item, MSNBC acknowledged its mistake: "Bad mix-up on our part w/@John_Thrasher quote today. Our apologies to him & @CharlieCrist campaign." Our ruling MSNBC wrongly attached the words of Scott’s campaign chairman to the Crist campaign. Crist’s campaign chairman did not blast the prospect of Nelson entering the Florida governor’s race. Scott’s did. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10406	"We are winning the popular vote."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/03/hillary-clinton/counting-votes-is-tricky-this-year/	After winning the primary in Puerto Rico on June 1, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton proclaimed in her victory speech, "We are winning the popular vote!" Clinton's implicit argument is that she may trail Sen. Barack Obama in delegates — the representatives who attend the convention and formally choose the nominee — but she's winning by another measure that should be more compelling. It's an argument that could resonate with the Democrats' bitter memory of the 2000 campaign, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush in the Electoral College. But it's important to note that general elections are very different from nominating contests. In the general election, people in every state vote on the same day. For the nominating contest, people don't always vote — sometimes they caucus — and the political parties control when and how the contests unfold. Which brings us to the significant problems with the way Clinton arrives at her winning number. These problems chiefly have to do with the state of Michigan. Recall that before the nominating process kicked off with the Iowa caucuses back in January, Michigan and Florida moved their primaries to earlier in the year without the authorization of the Democratic Party. As punishment, the party stripped the two states of their delegates, and Clinton and Obama promised not to campaign in the states. This very likely suppressed turnout. "They were not elections that were conducted as free and fair elections in any sense of the words," said Anthony Corrado, professor of government at Colby College in Maine. In Florida, neither candidate campaigned, and Clinton beat Obama by a good margin, about 17 percent. In Michigan, state rules allowed candidates to remove their names from the ballot, which Obama and several other Democratic candidates did. Clinton, however, did not remove her name. In the primary, Clinton faced off against Chris Dodd, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich and Uncommitted. When Clinton calculates her popular vote lead, there's no way she can get to a winning number unless she counts Michigan, where Obama's name was not on the ballot. The Clinton campaign has said Obama didn't have to take his name off the ballot, which is true, but counting a Clinton victory over Obama when his name didn't appear on the ballot is dubious. Another problem with the nomination process is the difficulty with counting voter support in caucus states. Caucuses can work different ways, but in some cases voters don't cast traditional ballots. In Iowa's Democratic caucus, for instance, supporters stand in different parts of a meeting room. Minor candidates are knocked out of the running, and their supporters in turn pick new candidates. At the end of the night, each candidate's support is translated into state delegates, who attend a state convention and then pick delegates to go to the national convention. But there's never a formal tally of individual caucusgoers. In caucuses, the best that can be done is to calculate estimates, based on state delegates and turnout estimates; Obama holds a sizable lead in these contests. The news Web site RealClearPolitics has developed caucus estimates for Iowa, Nevada, Maine and Washington, and has applied it to several scenarios involving Michigan: * If you don't count Michigan, Obama wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates. * If you do count Michigan, Clinton wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates. * If you count Michigan and award Uncommitted's votes to Obama, then Obama wins with the caucus estimates, and Clinton wins without caucus estimates. Obama could similarly claim to lead the popular vote, Corrado said. But Clinton is talking about the popular votes because she can't say she has won the most delegates or the most states. "The bottom line is that they have divided the vote up fairly closely," he said. "It shows how closely contested the race was between these two candidates. It's really remarkable when you think about it." Indeed, in every scenario presented by RealClearPolitics, whether Obama leads or Clinton leads, the difference between the two candidates is less than 1 percent. For Clinton's statement to be true, a lot hinges on how you think Michigan's votes should be counted, and how you handle voter support in the caucus states. We can't say how Obama would have done in Michigan if his name had been on the ballot, but he certainly would have garnered more than zero votes. The wishes of voters in caucus states should also be considered for a claim on the popular vote. Finally, some could argue that you shouldn't count Florida since neither candidate campaigned there. For all of these reasons, we find Clinton's argument that she's winning the popular vote to be true only if you consider the messy, real-world results in the light most favorable to Clinton, and for this reason we find her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14798	Jeb Bush’s plan for Social Security is "disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/nov/30/annette-taddeo-goldstein/jeb-bushs-social-security-plan-raises-retirement-a/	Congressional hopeful Annette Taddeo warned Florida seniors preparing for a Thanksgiving feast that a Jeb Bush presidency could starve their plans for retirement. Taddeo, the former chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, attempted to link Bush’s plan for Social Security to her Republican opponent, Carlos Curbelo of Miami, in a fundraising email PolitiFact Florida received Nov. 24, 2015 (click here to read the letter). "Have you seen presidential hopeful Jeb Bush’s plan for Social Security? It’s disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70," the email read. "But Bush is the candidate Annette’s opponent, Congressman Carlos Curbelo, thinks should be leading our country. Not that that’s a surprise after Curbelo called Social Security a ‘Ponzi scheme’ and voted for Speaker Ryan’s devastating budget. South Florida needs someone who will fight for Social Security — not work to end it." Curbelo did call Social Security a Ponzi scheme in his first bid for Congress. That is not an accurate description of the program, so we rated Curbelo's statement False. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Bush really released a Social Security plan for seniors that raises the retirement age to 70. (We won’t weigh in on whether it’s "disastrous.") We found that Bush's plan doesn't suggest a specific age, and he also doesn't think the eligibility age should change for current seniors. Bush’s comments Taddeo’s campaign directed us to a condensed version of Bush’s plan to reform Medicare and Social Security on Medium.com, which linked to the full plan on his website. Bush proposes allowing small businesses to set up collective or individual retirement accounts for workers. He also wants to slow down the growth of costs by cutting payments to higher-income seniors who have been able to save more while increasing minimum payments. Relevant to this fact-check, he suggests raising the retirement age, although he doesn’t say by how much. He says working longer is something many workers desire. "We need to recognize that Americans are living longer, healthier lives, and we should make it easier for those who choose to work longer," Bush wrote. "Life expectancy has increased substantially since Social Security was created in 1935. Yet Social Security’s structure still discourages work past the age of 62. Reforms should update Social Security to respect seniors’ desires and abilities to work later in life." That doesn’t mention 70 as the potential new retirement age for full benefits, though Bush did use that number earlier this year on CBS’ Face the Nation. Host Bob Schieffer noted during the May 31 interview that Bush favored raising the age and asked him how high. "I think it needs to be phased in over an extended period of time. I have seen ideas that are 68, for example," Bush said. "So people that already have the supplemental retirement system, which is a contract, I don't think we violate that. For people that are about ready to be beneficiaries of their supplemental retirement, I don't think we change that. But we need to look over the horizon and begin to phase in over an extended period of time going from 65 to 68 or 70. And that by itself will help sustain the retirement system for anybody under the age of 40." Bush has made similar comments at other points this year, though he only gave a specific age range to Schieffer. He has repeatedly said his plan would not affect current retirees or Americans nearing it. Bush told an audience in New Hampshire on April 17, "I think we need to raise the retirement age, not for the people that already nearing (or) receiving Social Security ... but raise it gradually over a long period of time for people that are just entering the system." And on June 2, a few days after appearing on Face the Nation, Bush told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, "Social Security — I think we need to adjust it, because life expectancy has gone up, … adjusted by retirement age going up. … If we're going to fix it for the next 50 years, we need to start working on it now and progressively raise the retirement age. But people that are near retirement or already in retirement, I don't believe there should be any (impact)." We should note that in his Face the Nation comments, Bush was wrong about the current retirement age. Bush suggested that the current retirement age for full benefits is 65, but that’s only for people born in 1937 or earlier. For people born between 1943 and 1954, the current retirement age for full benefits is 66, and the age rises incrementally after that. Those born in 1960 or later will get full benefits at 67. It’s clear Bush has brought up raising the retirement age for future Social Security beneficiaries as a way to stabilize the program. But Taddeo’s characterization of what he has said falls short on several fronts. Our ruling Taddeo said Bush’s plan for Social Security is "disastrous for seniors and raises the retirement age to 70." Taddeo has a point that Bush said he is open to the idea of raising retirement ages, but her email mischaracterizes his plan. Her email attempts to convince seniors nearing retirement that benefit changes are imminent if Bush is elected. Bush has repeatedly said he does not intend to alter Social Security for current retirees or those who would be joining the program soon. And while 70 is one of several ages Bush threw out in an interview, his official plan doesn't establish specifics beyond stating age reforms are needed. Taddeo’s statement contains an element of truth about Bush’s plan for Social Security but exaggerates that point to scare seniors. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14572	Says Ruben Kihuen "only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced" during the 2015 legislative session.	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/08/lucy-flores/flores-attack-kihuens-legislative-record-2015-larg/	Nevada Democrats are champing at the bit to take on first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy. Hardy represents just one of a handful of Republican-held House seats that lean Democratic, and his is widely considered one of the most "flippable" seats in 2016. The district includes parts of North Las Vegas and stretches across southern Nevada. Several high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, and attacks are already flying in one of the most-watched and well-funded congressional races in the country. Former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who made waves after endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, has aggressively gone after State Sen. Ruben Kihuen, who is generally considered the frontrunner after gaining the support of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the state’s powerful Culinary Union. At a January candidate forum in rural Pahrump, Nev, Flores portrayed Kihuen (pronounced KEY-WIN) as an ineffective lawmaker and attacked his record, including a signature bill passed in 2015 expanding low-income college scholarships. "Frankly, he only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 that he introduced," she said. "And the college bill was actually primarily sponsored by the Republican majority leader, so of course the Republican majority leader wasn’t going to let that bill fail." We thought her claim merited fact-checking. Kihuen’s legislative record has been scrutinized since 2011, when the Las Vegas Sun pointed out he was one of two lawmakers who did not introduce a single bill in the legislative session. The Flores campaign pointed to that article, and provided a list of bills that Kihuen introduced during the 2015 legislative session as evidence of Kihuen’s ineffectiveness. (The Nevada Legislature only meets for six months every two years.) Flores’ allegation is mostly on the mark. Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law — a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. But she misidentifies the co-sponsor of arguably Kihuen’s biggest legislative accomplishment. (Flores owned up to the mistake after the forum.) Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state’s first need-based college scholarship program. The "Silver State Opportunity Grant Program" allocates $5 million over two years for low-income students enrolled in Nevada community colleges and universities, and more than 670 students are signed up. Kieckhefer said the bill originated from a college affordability summit hosted by the two before the legislative session, and he credited Kihuen for helping push the legislation through with minimal opposition. "Ruben and I were partners on this bill, and I know he worked it hard on his side," he said. Flores’s comments also strike at a larger issue - finding the best way to measure legislative effectiveness. Kihuen’s campaign manager, Dave Chase, said because Democrats were in the minority during the session, it makes more sense to measure effectiveness by what Kihuen was able to prevent from happening. "The real work comes in committee and on the floor, where Ruben, while in the minority, fought to kill reckless Republican bills that would have ended collective bargaining, overtime pay and rolled back key voting rights all while passing 19 bills he sponsored," he wrote in an email. "Ms. Flores should ask the 700 students going to college right now thanks to Ruben's work if he was effective last session." Kihuen served as part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus, and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised Kihuen’s work during the legislative session. As for the critical 2011 article in the Sun, Damore said he was "hesitant" to lend much credence to a five-year old article and recommended looking at Kihuen’s more recent legislative accomplishments. A full list is here. Six of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2013 session were eventually signed into law. UNLV political science professor David Damore said it’s difficult to measure legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws that are passed. "Certainly factors such as majority or minority status as well as seniority play into passage, and of course not every bill that gets passed should be become law, and not all that do have an equal impact," he said in an email. Nevada lawmakers are also limited as to the number of bills they can propose during the session, so legislators can’t propose dozens of bills to pad their numbers. Our ruling Flores said Kihuen "only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced" during the 2015 legislative session. Flores is technically accurate in her criticism. But the insinuation that he was an ineffective legislator because of that ignores some important context about the realities of being in the minority party and his role in passing other legislation behind the scenes. Her claim is accurate but needs additional context. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Lucy Flores	None	None	None	2016-02-08T15:21:04	2016-01-21	['None']
pomt-05570	Says Texas retained the right to have a navy when it joined the United States.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/apr/04/chain-email/chain-email-says-texas-reserved-right-its-own-navy/	A Highway Patrol boat policing the Texas-Mexico border is part of the "Texas Navy," claims a chain email sent to us February 19, 2012. Alongside several pictures of a gun-carrying powerboat, the email says Texas is bringing new force to bear on drug cartel violence on the border. Falcon Lake will "soon be safe" as the Department of Public Safety launches "our first Naval vessel of this century," it says. It also claims, "When Texas joined the Union as a sovereign nation in 1836, we retained the right to have a Navy to ward off the Mexicans." Did Texas keep, at statehood, the right to have its own navy? First, about that gunboat: The craft pictured is part of the DPS’ Tactical Marine Unit, created in 2011. Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville region Commander Jose Rodriguez told us by telephone that it’s one of six shallow-water "interceptor" boats the state is buying for the marine unit -- which is not referred to as a "navy," he said. DPS says the fleet will patrol the Rio Grande, border lakes and Intracoastal Waterway. Second, let’s clear up a date error: Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836 (the 176th anniversary of the decisive battle will be April 21, 2012) but didn’t join the United States until 1845. In between, the Republic of Texas was an independent country, complete with a president, Congress and embassies in Paris, London and Washington. The republic also had a navy -- two, in fact. The Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas says that to guard supply lines from New Orleans, Texas’ provisional government passed an "Act and Decree Establishing a Navy" on November 25, 1835. The first Texas Navy was four schooners purchased in January 1836 -- and all gone by mid-1837, according to the Handbook: The Liberty: Sold because Texas couldn’t pay its repair bills. The Invincible: Crew arrested and charged with piracy in New Orleans, but released. Hit a sandbar and sank while fighting Mexican navy. The Independence: Captured by Mexican navy. The Brutus: Ran aground, but not until after it had claimed Cozumel island for the Republic of Texas. Might have been nice. That sounds dire, but Jeff Hunt, director of the Texas Military Forces Museum at Camp Mabry in Austin and an adjunct history professor at Austin Community College, told us the sailors acquitted themselves well in combat, considering their lack of resources. In 1839, the Handbook says, Texas commissioned ships for a second navy. President Sam Houston thought the expense was extravagant and tried to sell the fleet in 1843. "The people of Galveston, incensed at the thought of selling the navy, attended the auction and by force prevented the submission of bids. Thus the navy was returned to the Republic of Texas. Nevertheless, the cruise ending in July 1843 marked the end of the operative career of the Texas Navy, as a truce with Mexico came that summer and the United States undertook to protect Texas until her annexation." When Texas became part of the United States, its ships were ceded to the U.S. Navy via the Treaty of Annexation, Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States and Texas’ 1845 Constitution. Historian T.R. Fehrenbach, author of "Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans," told us by email, "Texas did not retain the right to have its own navy under the annexation treaty." None of the three documents mentioned a right to have a state navy. Nor did seceding 16 years later change the terms, Fehrenbach said. "One thing that is often overlooked is that according to a (U.S.) Supreme Court decision, Texas was never considered out of the Union, merely staging a rebellion that failed, so all of the provisions of the 1845 document (annexation treaty) were retained as valid," he said. Then again, we noticed the state’s 1866 Constitution briefly mentions a state navy: "The Governor shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of this State, and of the militia, except when they shall be called into the service of the United States." That constitution "was obviated by the current one," Fehrenbach said. "Nothing in it is applicable." Texas’ current constitution, adopted in 1876, and its statutes make no mention of a Texas Navy other than to declare the third Saturday in September "Texian Navy Day," honoring the Republic’s two fleets. Curiously, Texas governors have for decades granted purely honorary "Texas Navy" commissions. Governor’s office spokeswoman Steffany Duke told us by email, "According to official records in both our office and the state archives, it appears that these ceremonial commissions date back to the late 1950s." The Texas Navy historical society says on its website that one of the first admirals was Hollywood dancer Ginger Rogers, commissioned by Gov. James V. Allred in 1936 (the year that the Dallasite starred as a sailor’s sweetheart in "Follow the Fleet"). The society, although sometimes called the state’s "Third Navy," is a purely historical group, created by Gov. Price Daniel in 1958. Modern Texas’ naval military force is the 230-member Maritime Regiment, created in 2006 as part of the Texas State Guard. Brig. Gen. Robert Bodisch told us by telephone that his regiment is an emergency force trained in search and rescue, cadaver recovery and other crisis responses. While it is part of the Texas Military Forces, he said, it’s not a navy, which would comprise full-time professional troops. Our ruling We found no evidence that Texas retained the right to its own navy on joining the United States. The email’s central claim isn’t just incorrect, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12035	"President Obama used" his DACA order "to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/sep/15/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-obama-daca-citizenship-incorrect-claim-/	The lead lawyer for Texas state government hailed President Donald Trump’s rescission of predecessor Barack Obama’s move affording young unauthorized immigrants, sometimes called "Dreamers," renewable shields from deportation. Moreover, Attorney General Ken Paxton charged in a Sept. 5, 2017, press release, Obama "used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship." A reader asked us to check on that. In his release, Paxton said the program that Trump gave Congress six months to restore granted lawful presence and work permits to nearly a million "unlawfully present aliens." That's close to solid. The Pew Research Center recently estimated that fewer immigrants, nearly 790,000 people with roots mostly in Mexico, have received work permits and deportation relief through the Obama-launched Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Yet citizenship wasn’t a declared offering via DACA. The June 2012 Homeland Security memo announcing the program said: "This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights." Iowa senator touts figures So, what citizenship provision was Paxton talking about? By email, Kayleigh Lovvorn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, replied that DACA wasn’t intended to be a path to citizenship. But, Lovvorn wrote, figures released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicate that 39,514 DACA recipients have been approved for Lawful Permanent Resident status," green cards, her email implying that such individuals could later seek citizenship. A web search led us to a Sept. 1, 2017, press release from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, publicizing the USCIS figures. Grassley’s release said preliminary data "indicate that the Obama administration allowed thousands of DACA recipients to exploit an immigration law loophole to obtain green cards. The data also show that more than a thousand DACA recipients have already obtained citizenship." As of Aug. 21, 2017, Grassley’s release said, 45,447 DACA recipients had been approved for "advance parole" with 3,993 applicants getting applications denied. "This approval," the release says, "allows a DACA recipient to travel out of the country and legally return, making them eligible to adjust their immigration status and receive a green card." We’ll delve into "advance parole." But first, more numbers from Grassley’s release: 59,778 DACA recipients have applied for green cards with 39,514 approved. Also, the release said, 2,181 of the green-card recipients have applied for U.S. citizenship--with 1,056 becoming citizens, which would break out to 0.1 percent of DACA recipients becoming citizens, by our calculation. We spotted no elaboration in the release--and didn’t draw any from Grassley aides or Homeland Security--demonstrating that any of the tallied individuals obtained citizenship by virtue of being a DACA recipient. On the other hand, legal experts supportive of DACA told us the advance parole aspect of the program may have helped individuals attain legal residency and citizenship. In each instance, the experts stressed, a person getting citizenship would first need to have been sponsored by an immediate family member--most commonly a spouse--who was already a legal permanent resident or citizen, which would have been required regardless of an applicant’s DACA participation. Natalia Drelichman, an attorney for Austin-based American Gateways, which serves refugees and other immigrants, said by phone: "The fact that individuals are eligible to apply for green cards if they have a qualifying relative, somebody who can apply for them, is old news." Drelichman and others stressed that attaining citizenship, for any immigrant, is a multistep process. "Only some DACA recipients will be eligible for green cards," Drelichman said. "And the path from green card to citizenship is long and requires meeting certain obligations, including payment of federal income taxes, at least three years of continual legal permanent residency, and passing the" required "civics and history exam," Drelichman said. "There is no direct route to citizenship uniquely available to DACA holders." Employing advance parole We dug into advanced parole after hearing back from Arwen FitzGerald, a USCIS spokeswoman, who reaffirmed by email that an estimated 40,000 DACA recipients have received Legal Permanent Resident status and another 1,000 have become citizens. FitzGerald also said: "The majority of these cases received their status through a grant of advance parole." Separately, the Fact Checker at The Washington Post said in a Sept. 7, 2017, analysis that Grassley’s release failed to account for DACA recipients who wouldn’t have needed advance parole to seek legal residency because the beneficiaries had previously entered the U.S. with visas and not left in the meantime. All told, that story estimated that about 3,000 DACA recipients may have used the advance parole strategy to pursue legal residency. Advance parole, experts told us, reflects an element of immigration law that permits certain people living in the U.S. without legal authorization--including some members of the military and some juveniles-- to travel to a home country for a specified purpose and then have the opportunity, with federal approval, to return--and no longer be considered someone who’d entered the U.S. without permission. That clean-slate distinction can provide a lift because under U.S. law, it’s more difficult for someone living in the country after entering without legal permission to seek legal status. ‘An important strategy’ In a June 2016 memo on advance parole options for DACA recipients, the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which says it focuses on advancing immigrant rights, said DACA recipients approved for advance parole will, on return, "be paroled into the U.S., which is considered a lawful entry. This reentry with parole allows some of those immigrants more opportunities to seek permanent residence," according to the memo, which otherwise called such a request "an important strategy to consider." DACA recipients (unlike other immigrants seeking advance parole) must present a specific humanitarian, educational or employment reason for traveling to another country, the memo noted. Still, the center advised, someone who obtained advance parole wasn’t guaranteed re-entry. "When an advance parole recipient presents herself at a U.S. port-of-entry upon her return," the center said, "she will be subject to inspection by an immigration official who will make a discretionary decision as to whether she will be paroled into the United States." As Trump rescinded the DACA program, Homeland Security said new applications from DACA recipients for advance parole would no longer be accepted. Lawyers comment Drelichman, among expert attorneys we reached, called Paxton's statement "very misleading." If "you have DACA" status, she said, "it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a U.S. citizen." David Leopold, a Cleveland immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, also was critical, deeming Paxton’s claim "a gross mischaracterization" of DACA, which did not confer citizenship, Leopold said. A San Diego immigration attorney, Cesar Luna, noted by phone that whether a person landed advance parole or not, she or he still would have needed a sponsoring immediate family member to pursue citizenship. "You have to have another latch," Luna said. Our ruling Paxton said President Obama used the order creating DACA "to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship." It’s flat-out incorrect to say that Obama via DACA conferred citizenship on anyone. That’s not how the system works, and the attorney general should know better. This unsupported characterization traces to a few DACA recipients--about a tenth of 1 percent—who gained citizenship in part by returning from abroad with a clean slate in accord with existing laws not amended by DACA.

pomt-02091	In the Georgia-Russia conflict, "we flew a brigade of Georgian soldiers" from Iran to Georgia and "sent U.S. ships into the Black Sea and provided various kinds of supplies."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/19/dick-cheney/cheney-bush-admin-did-more-help-georgia-obama-has-/	As events have proved, Russian President Vladimir Putin exerts far more influence than the West over the fate of Ukraine. On Fox News Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney faulted President Barack Obama for giving Putin the sense that he could take advantage of a weak U.S. policy. When he was reminded that Russia had done exactly as it pleased on Georgian territory under the George W. Bush administration, Cheney said that was different. "What we did at the time was, I think, a more robust response," Cheney said. "We flew in a brigade of Georgian soldiers that had been involved supporting our efforts in Iraq, flew them back into Georgia. We tried to provide some support there, as well as sent U.S. ships into the Black Sea and provided various kinds of supplies." Other Republicans have made the same point. We are not able to compare the robustness of the Bush and Obama responses to Russia but we can add some details about the Georgian troops and the U.S. supplies. A quick recap In 2008, armed conflict erupted in Georgia over two separatist regions within Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several years of restiveness by Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia, the Georgian government made a military push that attempted to retake control of the region in August 2008. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, including in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. The Georgian brigade airlift On Aug. 11, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported that the U.S. military had "nearly completed" the airlift of 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia. At the time, the United States took pains to portray its actions as being limited rather than aggressive. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters that the United States was "fulfilling our agreement with the Georgian government that, in an emergency, we will assist them in redeploying their troops. We are honoring that commitment." Whitman told reporters at the time that the 130 U.S. troops and military contractors who were already in the country to train Georgian troops had been brought together at an undisclosed location away from the hostilities. And Whitman made clear to reporters that -- contrary to allegations by Putin -- the United States was not flying the Iraq-based Georgian troops to the war zone. The U.S. war ships The United States -- and its military alliance, NATO -- did indeed have ships in the Black Sea near Georgia in August 2008, but the story behind their presence is more nuanced than an unmistakable show of force against Russian aggression. The administration sent the guided missile destroyer McFaul to the Georgian port of Batumi, but it was loaded with humanitarian aid. "At the time, these gestures were not viewed as particularly strong," said Lincoln Mitchell, who was chief of party for the National Democratic Institute in Georgia from 2002 to 2004 and is now affiliated with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "complained throughout the war that he was not getting support," Mitchell told PunditFact in March. David L. Phillips is director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights. "There was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that," Phillips said. "It was for show. It would be misleading to suggest that our response was so robust that it deterred further aggression." Our ruling Cheney said the Bush administration flew Georgian troops back to Georgia and used American war ships to provide supplies during that country’s conflict with Russia. While both actions took place, the troops were not sent into combat against Russian forces and the supplies were humanitarian. Neither effort tipped the military balance in Georgia’s favor. The statement has a measure of truth but leaves out some important nuances. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13782	"A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean’s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/20/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-million-ohio-democrats-changed-parties/	Republican radio host and pundit Hugh Hewitt slammed the Democratic party on a July 20 MSNBC panel, charging that the party failed the Rust Belt economically and prompted liberal voters to jump ship. Hewitt was part of a panel that included former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and a former party chairman. "A million Democrats deserted Howard’s party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year," Hewitt said. The 2016 Republican primary was remarkable, given the 17-candidate field. Is Hewitt’s "million" figure right? And is Trump the reason behind a massive party switch in the Buckeye State? In Ohio, party affiliation is determined by what ballot a voter requests in a primary election. The voter will continue to be affiliated with that party, unless he or she requests a different party’s ballot in another primary election. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that 5 percent of voters in Ohio who cast ballots in the March 2016 primary switched from the party they were affiliated with in 2012. But many more former Democrats requested Republican ballots than vice-versa. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted released the stats that showed that in total, 1.8 million Ohio voters joined or changed parties by voting last March. The GOP picked up almost a million new voters to its rolls in that primary, but 910,131 of those were previously unaffiliated. According to Husted’s data, 115,762 former Democratic voters swapped for Republican ballots. That’s not a million. We asked some political scientists for their opinions. "There's an old saying in the social sciences: don't mistake correlation with causality," said L. Marvin Overby, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. "I would be very surprised if the voter changes were motivated by a desire among Democrats to vote for Trump. It seems more plausible that they opted to identify as Republicans to vote in the GOP primary for (Ohio Gov. John) Kasich and against Trump, especially given that the Democratic presidential primary wasn't very competitive." Ohio’s donkeys-turned-elephants might have been reacting to Trump’s candidacy, agreed Michael C. Munger of Duke University, but it’s impossible to know for certain. "Trump did not even win Ohio. Kasich hammered him by 10 percentage points. It would be odd to think of them as Trump voters, then," Munger said. He concurred that it makes more sense that former Democrats crossed the aisle to cast votes against Trump. In that case, the phenomenon was due to Trump -- but not to his advantage. We reached out to Hewitt but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. Our ruling As part of an MSNBC panel, Hewitt said, "A million Democrats deserted (Howard Dean’s) party and joined my party because of Donald Trump in Ohio this year." Without polling the Dems-turned-GOP, it’s not possible to know exactly why they switched parties. But data from the secretary of state showed that 115,762 Republican ballots were cast by former Democrats. An impressive number -- but not a million.

pomt-10302	"Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/08/john-mccain/obama-voted-for-budget-resolution-not-taxes-/	New political ads from John McCain accuse Barack Obama of raising taxes on the middle class. "Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000," an announcer says in a television ad. "He promises more taxes on small business, seniors, your life savings, your family." To support this statement, the McCain campaign points to two Obama votes on budget resolutions, one in March 2008 and another in June 2008. Problem is, neither of these votes actually raised taxes, nor were they expected to. Instead, the votes approved budget resolutions, which are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The tax cuts would have been rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But as we have pointed out in other stories, it's inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions, which don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The ad gives an overall false impression that Obama as president would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000. He does not. Obama's tax proposals are crafted so that tax increases hit those couples $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles). Because the ad cherry-picks a vote that would not have directly changed the tax code, we find the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-08T00:00:00	2008-08-08	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-13915	"For every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school, her chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by half."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/24/tim-kaine/more-schooling-reduces-hiv-risk-how-much/	There are any number of arguments for boosting the education of girls in poorer nations. A person who knows more, regardless of gender, tends to earn more. The children of mothers with more education often do better themselves. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., added another item to the list. At a Senate hearing on June 15, 2016, Kaine said, "For every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school, her chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by half." As it turns out, Kaine had the general thrust right, but he went too far with the exact numbers. Here’s what the research shows. Botswana gave the world a natural experiment in 1996 when it changed its education policy by adding an extra year — grade 10 — to basic education. Botswana kept good records that covered both who stayed in school and their HIV status in the years that followed. Nearly two decades later, social scientists hopped on all that data. Their 2015 article in the medical journal Lancet found that among girls, the lifetime risk of HIV infection dropped by about one-third -- not one-half. Kaine’s press office cited that Botswana study as the source behind his statement. Looking at some of the wording in the article, we can see why they might read it to say that the risk for women fell by half. But it didn’t. We talked to one of the main researchers, Jacob Bor at Boston University’s School of Public Health, to confirm that it was reduced by one-third. Here’s the key table from that article. We underlined the key numbers in red. Before the reform, women had a 32.3 percent risk of catching the HIV infection. After getting the extra year of school, that risk came down by 11.6 percentage points, or roughly one-third. We’d also note that Kaine’s statement also parted from the Botswana study in that he talked about "every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school," while the study only had data on a single extra year. To say that the risk fell for every extra year would go far beyond what the research shows. Still, Bor said Kaine has the right idea. "He’s qualitatively correct, but quantitatively a little bit off," Bor said. "Also, these results are local to the incredibly high HIV prevalence in Botswana and their education reform. If you just parachute-dropped a year of extra schooling in another country, it’s not so clear you’d see the same result." Two studies out of Uganda also give support to Kaine’s broad concept, if not his actual numbers. Two Harvard researchers reported that between 1990 and 1995, HIV rates fell by about 13 percentage points. During that time, Uganda moved to keep children in school longer. The study said the driving factor was women delayed having sex. "(Education) policy can explain between one-sixth and one-half of this overall decline," the authors wrote in their 2013 article. That is a wide range, but it still shows movement in the direction that Kaine described. About a decade earlier, Damien de Walque, now at the World Bank, looked at 15 villages in Uganda. He and his colleagues found that "for girls born after 1970, one additional year of education reduced HIV incidence, that is the risk of getting infected with HIV/AIDS, by 21 percent," de Walque told us. That was for primary school, not secondary. "Sen. Kaine’s statement is largely correct that the more additional years of education a girl receives, the less likely it is that she will be infected with HIV," de Walque said. Our ruling Kaine said that a woman’s risk of HIV infection fell by half for every extra year of secondary school. That statement goes too far in a couple of ways. The biggest decline in risk that any study found with any precision was about one-third. That’s substantial, but it isn’t half. And Kaine erred in saying that the effect would come with each additional year, when the underlying Botswana study only looked at a single extra year. But in broad terms, leading researchers in the field gave Kaine points for getting the general point correct. More education has an appreciable impact in reducing a woman’s risk of contracting HIV. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b51dca6f-c24b-44c8-986f-9efec35b1a09	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-06-24T12:00:00	2016-06-15	['HIV/AIDS']
pomt-10268	While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed "tax cuts for hard-working families."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/michelle-obama/obama-sponsored-earned-income-tax-credit/	Michelle Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 25, 2008, dwelling largely on a personal portrait of her home life with Barack Obama and her upbringing in a working-class family on Chicago's South Side. She concluded her speech with a call to civic duty. "I believe that each of us — no matter what our age or background or walk of life — each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation. It's a belief Barack shares — a belief at the heart of his life's work. ... "It's what he did in the Illinois Senate, moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard-working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work." Here, we'll look at a claim we checked previously , that Obama won "tax cuts for hard-working families." In 2000, the Illinois legislature created a state earned income tax credit, based on the federal earned income tax program, which is a tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. The program is meant "to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work," according to the Internal Revenue Service. In the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund. In the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators who co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day. But the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent, and it allowed for a refund if state funds were available. The record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.

pomt-13668	Says "Marco Rubio didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/04/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-ad-misleads-about-marco-rubio-missi/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, who hopes to win the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Marco Rubio, has frequently attacked Rubio’s absence from many of the chamber’s votes when Rubio was running for president in 2015 and 2016. Murphy hammered away at this theme in an ad released Aug. 1, 2016. The ad starts with a narrator asking, "Marco Rubio, how can you protect us when you fail to show up for work?" The ad then excerpts a pro-Rubio ad that boasted,"Rubio wrote the toughest sanctions on Hezbollah ever passed." (Hezbollah is an Islamist group based in Lebanon and designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 1997.) Then, the narrator of the Murphy ad counters, "Wait a second, Marco Rubio didn’t show up for that vote. Missed more votes than anyone in the entire U.S. Senate last year." In March, we rated Mostly True the claim that Rubio "has the No. 1 absentee record" in the Senate. But is Murphy correct that "Marco Rubio didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill to tighten sanctions against Hezbollah? It’s a little complicated. Let’s recap what happened. The floor action The Rubio camp argues that Murphy is constructing a straw man, since there wasn’t a formal "vote" on the Hezbollah sanctions bill. Rather, it passed by unanimous consent -- a procedural mechanism in which senators are given an opportunity in advance to object to a bill or other action. Under unanimous consent, if no advance objections are made, then the measure proceeds to the floor. At a prearranged time, a senator requests unanimous consent to consider the bill passed, and -- if the presiding officer hears no objection from senators in the chamber -- so orders. No individual votes are recorded and no other senators need to be present. The bill in question was passed by unanimous consent on Nov. 17, 2015. (It was eventually signed by President Barack Obama and became law.) We turned to the C-SPAN archives and the Congressional Record to nail down exactly what happened that day. At 6:30 p.m., the Senate was in the aftermath of a vote. Most senators appeared to have left the floor, as can be seen in this screenshot. A few minutes later, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., was given the floor to call for consideration of H.R. 2297, The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015. Technically, he was there to ask that an existing bill be renamed and filled with newly agreed-upon text addressing the Hezbollah sanctions. Daines said he was seeking unanimous consent that the measure be "agreed to ... as amended" and "passed." Here’s a screenshot of Daines making that request. Following what is usually a carefully choreographed procedure, the presiding officer, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said, "Without objection, it is so ordered." Here’s Gardner: And the deed was done. What experts say Experts in Senate procedure said it’s misleading for Murphy to say that Rubio "didn’t show up" for the vote on his bill, because it was not a formal vote in which all senators were supposed to be present so their individual votes could be recorded. In this case, there appear to be only a handful of senators in the chamber at the time -- Daines, Gardner and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who was waiting for his turn to deliver a floor speech. The main chance for Rubio -- or any other senator -- to weigh in on the measure would have been as the unanimous consent proposal was being circulated before the bill reached the floor. In fact, under the kinds of Senate attendance tallies that Murphy cited elsewhere in the ad, a senator’s absence from a unanimous consent vote would not even count as an absence, experts said. "It's not unusual for the Senate to pass bills by unanimous consent," said Sarah A. Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. "Given the Senate's byzantine floor rules and senators' schedules, the Senate relies on voice votes to get non-controversial measures passed. So Sen. Rubio's absence, even for a bill that he sponsored, strikes me as within the norm of Senate practice. The harder work of most bills is getting a bill to the floor and securing bicameral and presidential agreement." Binder added that "a challenger's campaign is certainly on the mark to challenge an incumbent's voting participation, but I'd be hesitant to highlight a bill that passed (this way) as the best evidence of low attendance." Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, also called the assertion in Murphy’s ad "misleading" and added that none of the Senate cosponsors -- a mix of Democrats and Republicans -- were on the floor, either. When we contacted the Murphy campaign, spokeswoman Galia Slayen said that Rubio "is campaigning on passing a bill, but when that bill passed, he was not present." The campaign also noted that Rubio was fundraising on the day of the vote, which is supported by contemporary coverage in the Tampa Bay Times. Our ruling Murphy’s ad said that Rubio "didn’t show up" for a vote on his own bill on sanctions against Hezbollah. Some may perceive it as embarrassing for Rubio to have missed that moment on the floor to chase donors instead, but on the substance, Murphy’s assertion is distinctly misleading. The bill in question passed under unanimous consent, a commonly used Senate procedure in which individual senators’ votes are not tallied, and in which most senators -- even bill sponsors and co-sponsors -- are not typically in the chamber. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13505	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-cites-clinton-support-more-syrian-refug/	It’s an old political motto: A good offense is good defense. So to defend Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence went on the attack against Hillary Clinton’s policies. On NBC’s Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked Pence about Trump’s policies to ban Muslims from entering the United States. In recent weeks, Trump has said he would ban Muslims from countries with terrorist activity. When Todd pressed Pence about what countries those would be, Pence changed the subject to Clinton’s Syria policy. "Well, Hillary Clinton wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent," Pence said. "Donald Trump and I believe that we should suspend the Syrian refugee program." Pence added that their preferred policy is to work with Arab countries to establish safe zones closer to Syria. We wanted to look at Pence’s claim that Clinton’s policy is for 550 percent increase. That number is accurate for now. Syrian refugees by the numbers The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international agency that tracks and promotes refugee resettlement around the world. Its current count of people who have fled the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011, is 4.8 million. Many of those 4.8 million refugees are in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. Due to overcrowding and the large number of overall refugees, the UN has called on other countries around the world to accept more Syrians for resettlement. President Barack Obama agreed on behalf of the United States to accept 10,000 refugees for fiscal year 2016. The number was reached on Aug. 29, 2016, and the UN hailed the milestone in a press release. "We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded," said Shelly Pitterman, UNHCR regional representative in the United States. The agency reported that around 478,000 Syrians are in need of resettlement, and Syrians make up about 40 percent of all refugees worldwide who need resettlement. In September 2015, Clinton had called the 10,000-figure for the United States a good start but had urged an increase up to 65,000. Clinton said then the United States should be "looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women." That 65,000-figure is a 550 percent increase from the 10,000 that Obama supported. It’s important to note, however, that those numbers applied to fiscal year 2016, which ends by Oct. 1, 2016. Clinton has not discussed numbers for the next fiscal year. So it’s possible that 550 percent number may soon be out of date. We should also note that there is a screening process for refugees. The UN identifies and screens refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. U.S. security agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, then conduct multiple security checks. Our ruling Pence pointed to a real policy distinction between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees when he said that Clinton "wants to increase Syrian refugees to this country by 550 percent." Trump is opposed to refugee settlement, while Clinton supports it, and at a greater number than Obama’s current policy. Clinton supported allowing in 65,000 refugees when Obama supported a 10,000 figure. (The refugees would be screened.) That’s a 550 percent increase. The UN has determined that about 478,000 Syrian refugees are in need of resettlement. The statement is accurate and we rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c92c56-bd8d-4a39-b2c5-58a7fed58505	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-09-04T17:56:59	2016-09-04	['Syria']

pomt-02830	"You've got more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/22/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-more-people-want-hunt-moose-new/	With dismal early enrollment numbers, the new federal health insurance marketplace that went live in October 2013 has been derided by critics, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Speaking on his radio program, The Mike Huckabee Show, on Nov. 18, 2013, the one-time Republican presidential candidate argued that a staggeringly low number of Americans are interested in buying coverage under Obamacare. For example, in New Hampshire, Huckabee said, only 269 people enrolled in a health insurance plan through the new federal health insurance exchange. "To compare that, 281 people in New Hampshire were issued permits to hunt moose," Huckabee said. "So I mean, the fact is, you've got more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare." Huckabee tried to drive home his point a little further, asking, "Which is more likely to help you survive the winter in New Hampshire, a freezer full of moose meat or health insurance that your doctor won’t even accept?" The moose reference was so catchy that variations of the claim were made on several other talk radio shows around the same time, and they and took off across Facebook and Twitter as well. Huckabee’s radio show is broadcast on more than 200 radio stations in 44 states. We reached out to Huckabee, who offered little explanation. "It was a radio story I did based on report from NH that more people had applied for moose hunting permits than signed up for Obamacare," he said through a staffer. We wondered if it was true that more people in the state want to bag a moose than want to buy health insurance under Obamacare. First, the numbers. Huckabee is correct that New Hampshire’s Fish and Game Department issued 281 permits to moose hunters this year. But the number who wanted to go moose hunting was higher. Wildlife officials received more than 13,000 applications from people wanting to go moose hunting this year, and the state held a lottery to determine who got the permits. Not all of those applications were from New Hampshire residents, but there were about 13,000 people "wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire." Meanwhile, as of Nov. 2, 2013, only 269 people in New Hampshire had enrolled in a new health insurance plan. That’s fewer than the number of permits to hunt moose in New Hampshire, and far fewer than the number of applications to hunt moose in New Hampshire. But is that number greater than the amount of people in New Hampshire who "want Obamacare?" This is where things get tricky, because there’s no way to know how many people in New Hampshire want insurance coverage through the federal marketplace. By asserting that only 269 people in the state want a health care plan through the federal marketplace, Huckabee implies that everyone who wanted to sign up for coverage under Obamacare has already done so. There are a few reasons why this probably isn’t the case. For starters, it’s possible that some people just haven’t gotten around to enrolling in a plan yet. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicted the pace of enrollment would initially be slow when the marketplace opened in October 2013. DHHS is anticipating peaks in December -- when the deadline falls to apply for coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2014 -- and March, when the open enrollment period is scheduled to end. It’s also true that lingering technical problems with the federal health care website prevented some people in New Hampshire from signing up. New Hampshire engaged in a partnership with the federal government to operate its insurance exchange. That means residents who want to buy coverage online must navigate through healthcare.gov, the troubled website that was established to support the president’s health reform law. And while only 269 New Hampshire residents have enrolled in a new health care plan through the federal marketplace, a far greater number of individuals were listed as having completed applications. Some 7,817 people from New Hampshire were named on those applications. Very few of them enrolled in a plan, but it can be argued that every individual named on an application showed some level of interest in buying coverage under Obamacare. Many, if not most of these people, can reasonably be assumed to want Obamacare. We also have to consider the possibility that enrollment numbers increased during the month of November 2013. Huckabee cited data that reflects only the enrollment numbers up to Nov. 2, 2013. Sixteen days transpired between then and Nov. 18, 2013, when Huckabee made his claim. On that same day, the New York Times reported that enrollment through the federal health insurance marketplace had increased from less than 27,000 people nationwide during October to about 50,000 by mid-November. The new group of customers may include people from New Hampshire. The Department of Health and Human Services isn’t expected to release new enrollment figures until mid-December, making it impossible for now to gauge exactly how many additional people in New Hampshire have signed up. Our ruling Huckabee said that there are "more people wanting to go moose hunting in New Hampshire than want Obamacare." His statement is grounded in some verifiable data, but his wording choice casts doubt on the accuracy of the statement. On the one hand, at least 13,000 people applied to go moose hunting in New Hampshire this year, which is far more than the 269 who bought insurance through the new marketplace during the first month it was operational. However, it’s unlikely that only 269 people in New Hampshire want Obamacare. For starters, 7,817 New Hampshire residents were named on applications as potential enrollees. And others were likely scared away by the federal website’s technical problems, and the pace of enrollment was always expected to increase as deadlines neared. The bottom line is that no one can truly know how many people in New Hampshire "want Obamacare" at this early stage of enrollment. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10152	Sen. McCain's tax plan provides "virtually nothing to the middle class."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/02/joe-biden/mccains-tax-plan-doesnt-ignore-middle-class/	In the much-anticipated vice presidential debate, Sen. Joe Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sparred over distribution of the tax burden under the tax plans proposed by the top of their tickets. Biden picked up a refrain hammered by his running mate, Sen. Barack Obama, saying that Obama’s plan would provide more relief for the middle class. Biden would have been on solid footing had he stopped there, but he went one step further, claiming Sen. John McCain’s plan has nothing for the middle class. "The economic engine of America is middle class," Biden said. "It’s the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300-million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. It’s fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the superwealthy who are doing pretty well. They don’t need any more tax breaks." Though independent analyses of the income tax provisions have generally concluded McCain’s plan would most benefit wealthy Americans, his plan does have provisions that would help individuals with lower household incomes. Chief among these is a proposed increase to the exemption taxpayers may claim for each dependent — currently $3,500 — by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016, after which it would be indexed for inflation. Under the McCain plan, married couples that file a joint return reporting adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less would be eligible for the $7,000 exemption immediately. So clearly, middle- and lower-income households with children would receive above-average tax cuts. McCain also would raise and index for inflation the threshold for the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a separate income tax that was intended to ensure that people did not use loopholes to avoid paying taxes but that has been ensnaring more and more middle-income Americans. Congress in recent years has extended the AMT exemption for a year or two at a time so that large numbers of taxpayers don’t become subject to the tax. Congress is almost certain to enact another temporary "patch" covering the 2008 tax year. But McCain would permanently extend the AMT exemption, index it for inflation and allow individuals to claim personal nonrefundable credits against the AMT. How much this would help middle-class families largely depends on how you define middle class. The Tax Policy Center says it would primarily benefit more affluent households in the 80th to 95th percentile of income — those earning between $111,645 and $226,918 in 2008 dollars, were McCain’s plan to be fully phased in next year. Still, households with more modest means would not be subjected to the AMT under McCain’s proposal. McCain would also extend President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010. Those cuts collectively reduced top marginal tax rates on individuals’ incomes, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, expanded the child tax credit and reduced taxes on married couples compared to singles. The Tax Policy Center says McCain’s policy proposals collectively would reduce the tax exposure of 60 percent of all American households, though fewer than half of those making between $18,981 and $37,595. But for the middle 20 percent of taxpayers — people making between $37,595 and $66,354 — here’s how the Tax Policy Center sees the respective tax plans shake out: Under McCain’s plan, their tax bill would go down by $325 in 2009, on average, and $1,118 under Obama’s plan. If you look down the road to 2012, those in the middle quintile would see tax cuts of $1,441 under McCain’s plan and $2,197 under Obama’s. The analysis backs up Obama’s broad contention that McCain’s tax policy is weighted to give the largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. However, it’s wrong to say McCain’s plan would provide no relief to middle-class Americans. Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers’ AMT exposure. For this reason, we rule the Biden’s comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']
pomt-08399	"There are 100 members of the U.S. Senate. Fifty-seven of them, including Russ Feingold, are lawyers. There are zero manufacturers and one accountant."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/22/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-there-are-57-lawyers-including-ru/	Members of Congress have worked all sorts of interesting jobs before entering politics: casino dealer, meat cutter, major-league pitcher, riverboat captain, Navy battle group commander, toll booth collector, even coroner. But the most common background is law, as Republican Senate hopeful Ron Johnson is quick to point out. Johnson, who is facing lawyer and Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, made the point most directly in a recent TV ad. In it, he noted on a whiteboard that 57 of 100 members of the Senate are lawyers. "That would be fine if we had a lawsuit to settle," Johnson went on to say in the ad, "but we have an economy to fix. There are zero manufacturers and one accountant. It’s no wonder we’re losing jobs and piling up debt. I’m not a politician. I’m an accountant and a manufacturer. I know how to balance a budget, and I do know how to create jobs. Now that’s something we could really use." So, is the Senate a majority-lawyer body? And, importantly, is it bereft of people with a business background, as the ad implies? In making his claim, Johnson, who runs a 100-employee plastics manufacturing plant, cites a 2010 Congressional Research Service paper that shows 57 members of the Senate graduated from law school. Of course, having a law degree does not mean you were a practicing attorney before entering politics, as Feingold was for six years before and after he became a state lawmaker in 1982. Indeed, our own review of 100 Senate biographies -- yes, we read them all -- found some went right into public service or other careers out of law school. Case in point: Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, whose official biography says he ran for state Assembly right out of Harvard Law School in 1974. An earlier study by Congressional Quarterly, completed in 2008 before three changes to the Senate, showed law as the top occupation of senators (54 of them at the time), followed by public service (32) and business (26). To make his point, Johnson focuses narrowly on manufacturing and accountants -- two key points on his own résumé. But PolitiFact Wisconsin found a half-dozen senators who listed experience building and running a company, including Wisconsin’s Herb Kohl, who presided over the Kohl’s grocery and department store chain. More than 20 have at least some business background. When it comes strictly to manufacturers and accountants, Johnson’s claim is a little off. If Johnson continues at the helm of Pacur, his Oshkosh-based company, he may be the only active manufacturer. But Sen. Richard Lugar, Republican from Indiana, lists "manufacturing company executive" as one of his careers, according to Congressional Quarterly. His Senate website says he helped manage the family's food machinery manufacturing business in Indianapolis with his brother Tom. That was a long time ago -- before his public career began in the late 1960s. Meanwhile, Sen. Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma, is best known as a doctor, but in the 1970s he "served as manufacturing manager at the Ophthalmic Division of Coburn Optical Industries in Colonial Heights, Virginia," according to his bio. Under his leadership, the Virginia division of Coburn Optical grew from 13 employees to more than 350 and captured 35 percent of the U.S. market, the bio says. Johnson says there’s only one accountant in the Senate, but he’s off by one on that -- at least by education. He correctly cites Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, who was an accountant for an oil drilling company, according to his Senate bio. But Coburn was also educated as an accountant. So, how does this all tally out? In touting his background, Republican Ron Johnson says there are 57 lawyers, one accountant and no manufacturers in the U.S. Senate. He is correct that legal beagles -- not business people -- dominate the body, though some are lawyers by education, not trade. While Johnson’s bean-counting skills were not at their sharpest -- at least two members have a manufacturing background and two an accounting background -- his central point is on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2010-10-22T09:01:00	2010-09-28	['Russ_Feingold', 'United_States']
pomt-09072	"Four years as a congressman, he [U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson] never talked about MARTA."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/27/vernon-jones/congressman-quiet-marta-jones-says/	The population growth spurt in southeast DeKalb County over the past two decades has resulted in a grim reality: Traffic can be torture. In recent years, elected officials have talked about extending the region's rail service, MARTA, farther east in DeKalb to make commuting easier for area residents. Vernon Jones, a Democrat and former DeKalb County CEO who is running for Congress to represent the area, has complained incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson has not done enough to help MARTA since the congressman went to Washington in 2007. Here's one verbal volley by Jones from a June 3 candidate forum in southeast Atlanta: "Four years as a congressman, he [Johnson] never talked about MARTA." Never? Isn't that a little bit extreme? "You can't find anything where Hank has talked about MARTA," Jones said in a telephone interview last week. Well, PolitiFact Georgia decided to do a little exploring. A spokesman for Johnson, who represents Georgia's 4th Congressional District, sent PolitiFact Georgia a letter dated July 10, 2009, from the congressman to U.S. Rep. John Olver. Olver is a Democrat from Massachusetts who is chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation and other issues. Johnson asked for $9 million to help MARTA buy clean-fuel buses. Johnson also requested money for MARTA's I-20 East Transit Corridor and Clifton Corridor studies. "How much did [Johnson] get?" asked Jones. Johnson testified before Olver's committee on April 15, making another pitch for the I-20 rail study. He also asked the committee for $12 million to help MARTA buy new buses, to repair others and for security cameras. "They're pretty inaccurate and unfair," Johnson's spokesman, Andy Phelan, said of Jones' claims. Jones and Johnson, most DeKalb politicos know, worked together on the County Commission. Jones was DeKalb's chief executive officer from 2001 to 2008. Johnson was a county commissioner from 2001 to 2006, representing much of southeast DeKalb. Since 2009, Johnson has been a co-sponsor of four separate pieces of federal legislation that obtained $5.725 million for MARTA, agency records show. The bulk of that money, $4 million, was for the acquisition of clean-fuel buses. Jones argued that Johnson has been a bit player in these efforts to get money for MARTA. "Hank is the least senior member [of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation]," Jones said. "You cannot say he brought that money back [to Georgia]." Jones contends that Johnson did not get serious about his interest in MARTA until Jones began talking about the transit system on the campaign trail. Johnson was appointed earlier this year to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Shortly afterward, Johnson and his wife took a first-class trip on MARTA with the agency's CEO as his guide through the district. The fact remains that Johnson has talked about MARTA. The support of veteran congressmen such as Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson and Rep. John Lewis likely played a greater factor in getting the $5.7 million, but Johnson was a co-sponsor. If Jones had simply stated that he does not believe Johnson has done enough for MARTA, he might had dodged the Truth-O-Meter. But with his "never" declaration, the former CEO wandered right into the path of the dreaded device. Things are heating up in DeKalb County politics, it seems. We give Jones a Pants on Fire for this one.	None	Vernon Jones	None	None	None	2010-06-27T06:00:00	2010-06-03	['United_States', 'Hank_Johnson']

pomt-10294	"John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for... the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/13/barack-obama/mccains-on-georgias-side-so-is-obama/	Sen. Barack Obama has battered Sen. John McCain throughout the campaign for his ties to Washington lobbyists, arguing that McCain's lobbyist allies have influenced his policy positions. After Russia invaded Georgia on Aug. 8, Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan let loose another such accusation: "John McCain's top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the Republic of Georgia, and McCain has mirrored the position advocated by the government." McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has lobbied for Georgia. Scheunemann, a former national security adviser to former Senate Majority Leaders Trent Lott of Mississippi and Bob Dole of Kansas in the 1990s, signed a March 2004 contract — on file at the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act office — indicating that Scheunemann and his firm, Orion Strategies, would assist Georgia in gaining membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in exchange for $150,000 for a year's work. That goal has yet to be achieved — Russia vehemently opposes Georgia's inclusion — so Georgia has renewed the contract several times, most recently in May of this year, at a cost of $200,000 through the end of 2008. Scheunemann took a leave of absence from Orion Strategies earlier this year but it's probably fair to say that he remains invested in his firm, a two-person shop he started in 2001 with Mike Mitchell, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and to which he could easily return if McCain loses the presidency. Mitchell continues to handle the Georgia account. It's clear, too, that McCain has "mirrored the position advocated by the government" of Georgia, at least so far. McCain sponsored a nonbinding resolution that the Senate passed unanimously in December 2005 urging the United States to increase its efforts in support of the peaceful reincorporation of South Ossetia into Georgia. The resolution also commended the government of Georgia for devising a peace plan to "control peacefully and re-establish authority" in the separatist region. What's cloudier, indeed, is whether McCain's view of the Russian invasion differs substantially from Obama's. Reporters tried to pick apart the candidates' initial statements after Russian forces moved into Georgia on Aug. 8. A New York Times report, for example, argued that McCain's first statement was "immediate and tough," since McCain's statement blamed Russia for crossing an "internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of Georgia" while demanding that Russia "unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces." That mirrored what Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili had said Aug. 9, when he said Russia had launched a full-scale invasion and offered an immediate cease-fire. Obama, the New York Times said, "trod more carefully," not blaming Russia at first. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that his country had been provoked by Georgia's assault on South Ossetia, an autonomous, ethnically Russian region of Georgia. But as Russia continued its invasion into Georgian territory on Aug. 11, Obama moved toward McCain's position. "No matter how this conflict started, Russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over South Ossetia and invaded another country," he said. "There is no possible justification for these attacks." McCain and Obama have both now issued statements supporting Georgia's entry into NATO. There's no evidence that Scheunemann's ties to Georgia have influenced McCain's position, but it is correct to say McCain has supported the view of the Georgia government. The Obama campaign's statement about Scheunemann and McCain is True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-13T00:00:00	2008-08-09	['John_McCain']
pomt-03691	Congress has spent 66 of the first 100 days of this term in recess.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/22/john-barrow/congress-away-too-often-georgia-lawmaker-says/	Congress has received record-low approval ratings in recent years, thanks largely to the oceanlike divide on issues such as federal spending, taxes and gun control. One Georgia congressman offered another reason for public scorn. "On January 3rd, a new Congress convened with a mandate from voters all across this country to work together. Unfortunately, very little has changed. Too many in Congress are unwilling to compromise and do what’s necessary to get this country moving," said John Barrow, a Democratic House member from Augusta. "Sixty-six out of the first 100 days of this Congress have been spent in recess. That’s shameful. While I'd much rather be in Georgia meeting with folks across the 12th District, we have a lot of work to do in Washington." Barrow, who’s reportedly entertaining a run for the U.S. Senate, went on to say in the letter that he hasn’t been letting the grass grow under his feet during these many absences. "During those 66 days of recess, I’ve been busy meeting with folks all across the 12th District. I’ve visited with folks and held events in all 19 counties of the 12th Congressional District," Barrow said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Barrow’s claim about Congress being in recess an average of two out of every three days was accurate, or is he trying to score some political points at the expense of his colleagues. Barrow spokesman RIchard Carbo forwarded us a calendar prepared by the staff of one of the most influential Democrats in the House of Representatives, Steny Hoyer of Maryland. It notes in red each day Congress is scheduled to have votes this year. As Barrow wrote, the first day of the 113th Congress was Jan. 3, 2013. April 12 would have marked 100 calendar days since this Congress was convened. Hoyer’s calendar shows Congress held sessions to vote on 34 of those 100 days. We reviewed a Library of Congress calendar and found it had 41 days that Congress had been in session. Carbo explained that the Library of Congress calendar includes "pro forma" days, days when the House met for just a few minutes to conduct procedural matters. "There are lots of 10-minute sessions where there is no one around," said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute who has done extensive research on the machinations of Congress. Carbo also asserted "pro forma" sessions are held by the House’s Republican leadership to prevent President Barack Obama, a Democrat, from making appointments while Congress is in recess. The Congressional Record website shows that the House met for two to five minutes all of those days. The Senate, by our review of the Congressional Record’s information, met 33 of the first 100 days it was in session. Hoyer’s calendar does not include Jan. 21, in which both chambers of Congress were in a special session for the president’s public inauguration. We wondered whether the number of days Congress was in session the first 100 days of 2013 was disproportionate to past years. PolitiFact Georgia went back 20 years, looking at each odd year since those were years a new Congress was sworn into office. This year was in the middle. Here is the Library of Congress breakdown, not excluding possible "pro forma" days: 1995: 58 days 2007: 49 days 2009: 48 days 2011: 46 days 2003: 42 days 2013: 41 days 2001: 35 days 2005: 33 days 1999: 33 days 1997: 33 days Donald Wolfensberger, who worked 28 years for several Republican members of Congress with an expertise in parliamentary rules, offered one reason for the seemingly low number of days this Congress has been in session. "New Congresses take time to get committees organized and then for them to start cranking out legislation. Slow starts are not unusual," said Wolfensberger, a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. Ornstein, a columnist who co-wrote a book called "The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track," said he has long pushed for a congressional schedule of three weeks in session and one week off. Ornstein had a few ideas why Congress, particularly the Republican-led House, is not interested in meeting much in Washington. "They have an adversarial relationship with (Obama) and less in common," Ornstein said. Ornstein offered another reason members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, may want to spend less time in session: It’s tougher to raise the large sums of money now necessary to stay in office, and being in session takes time away from fundraising. To sum up, Barrow said Congress spent 66 of the first 100 days of the current session in recess. There were a few additional days the House was in session, albeit very, very short meetings. With that bit of context, we believe Barrow’s claim is Mostly True.	None	John Barrow	None	None	None	2013-04-22T06:00:00	2013-04-05	['None']
pomt-15220	"The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/10/jim-webb/webb-says-us-has-worlds-highest-incarceration-rate/	There are too many people in prisons, says former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. "The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world," Webb says on his campaign website. Webb often made the same claim while representing Virginia in the U.S. Senate from 2007-2013, and he introduced unsuccessful legislation that would have set up a bipartisan commission to study prison and sentencing reform. He’s said alternatives to prison should be set up for nonviolent criminals such as drug offenders. Last December, we gave a True rating to Webb’s statement that the U.S. has 25 percent of the known global prison population despite having only 5 percent of the world population. This time, we’ll look into his claim that the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate on the planet. The most comprehensive and widely-cited examination of the world’s prison population comes from the International Centre for Prison Studies at the University of London, which looks at prison populations in more than 200 countries and territories. In a 2013 report, the group said the U.S. prison population rate of 716 inmates per 100,000 people was No. 1 in the world. But that’s not the end of the story. The center updates its figures monthly. The latest figures on the center’s web site show the U.S. has 698 prisoners per 100,000. That’s the second highest in the world. Before reading further, guess who’s No. 1 ... It’s the island nation of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean near Africa. It has a population of 92,000, including 735 living behind bars. That translates to an incarceration rate of 799 per 100,000 people. Experts have told PolitiFact National that Seychelles’ tiny population makes its incarceration rate difficult to compare to that of the United States, which has nearly 320 million people. After all, a modest increase of prisoners by U.S. standards, say 100, would dramatically spike the Seychelle’s rate. There’s a big caveat with the center’s rankings. The group does not have inmate tallies for several countries, including North Korea, which is widely believed to have a large prison population. Amnesty International estimated in 2011 that the reclusive nation had 200,000 prisoners. That would equate to a world-leading incarceration rate of 813 per 100,000. Among industrialized nations tracked by the center, the U.S. incarceration rate of 698 per 100,000 is in a stratosphere by itself. Russia ranks second at 455 per 100,000. There’s no doubt that the U.S. prison population has soared during the last 40 years. Department of Justice figures show the nation’s incarceration rate held steady at about 110 per 100,000 from 1925 to 1975. Experts have pointed to many reasons for more recent surge, including tougher sentencing laws and a zeal to crack down on illegal drugs. Our ruling Webb said the U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world. The latest figures from the most comprehensive source show the U.S. is No. 2, behind Seychelles. There are data gaps for some countries, including such as North Korea whose prison figures can’t be verified but are estimated to be very high. That leaves the possibility that the U.S. could fall further down the list. It’s clear that the U.S. has one of the very highest incarceration rates in the world, but Webb’s claim that it’s the top doesn’t quite check out. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05211	Says Democratic runoff opponent Grady Yarbrough twice previously ran statewide as a Republican.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/08/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-grady-yarbrough-ran-twice-statewi/	Paul Sadler, a former legislator who is in a July 2012 runoff for the Democratic Party U.S. Senate nomination, told the Hispanic Caucus at the Texas Democratic Party state convention in Houston: "I’m running against a gentleman from San Antonio that ran as a Republican statewide twice." Sadler was referring to Grady Yarbrough, a retired schoolteacher who made the July 31 runoff in the May primary by finishing second to Sadler, who carried 35 percent to Yarbrough’s 26 percent. And has Yarbrough run previously for statewide office -- as a Republican? That’s so, according to a June 1, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article, which says this year Yarbrough is making his fourth statewide race. The story says he sought the 1986 and 1990 Republican nominations for state land commissioner and the 1994 Democratic nomination for state treasurer. According to election results posted online by the state, Yarbrough lost the 1994 Democratic primary for state treasurer to incumbent Martha Whitehead. The Texas Secretary of State’s office does not post the 1990 and 1986 primary results online, so we looked via the Nexis service for old news accounts mentioning Yarbrough’s runs as a Republican. According to a February 20, 1994, Dallas Morning News news article, Yarbrough, then a Tyler high school teacher, had run in 1986 and 1990 as a Republican for state land commissioner, losing runoffs both years. "This year," the Morning News story says, "he not only changed his political affiliation but also the spelling of his name, listing himself in his application for a place on the Democratic primary ballot as ‘Grady Yarborough.’" The story quotes Yarbrough as saying he made the name change for the ballot to counter allegations made by his opponent in the 1990 land commissioner's race that he was simply running then because "Yarbrough" prompted sympathetic sentiment, a reference to Ralph Yarborough, who had been one of the state’s U.S. senators. According to a June 7, 1986, Associated Press news story, Yarbrough lost the 1986 Republican runoff to M.D. Anderson, Jr., who had fended off criticism that he was trying to capitalize on his name matching the name of the well-known cancer treatment center. Finally, we reached Yarbrough, who confirmed his past Republican runs, saying of Sadler: "He’s trying to use a smear campaign, huh?" In a telephone interview, Yarbrough said he was invited by a Tyler friend to help the Republican Party in about 1984 and volunteered to help Republican Bill Clements make his successful last run for governor in 1986. Yarbrough said he left the GOP after the party’s chairman in 1990 refused to condemn another candidate for the party's land commissioner nomination who had offended Yarbrough by saying that his name was adapted from slave holders. The opponent, Yarbrough told us, "should not have brought that up." Yarbrough said he became a Democrat after the 1990 race because he felt he was no longer welcome in the Republican Party. We rate Sadler’s statement as True.	None	Paul Sadler	None	None	None	2012-06-08T16:25:37	2012-06-08	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09586	"With a stroke of a pen, the (U.S. Supreme Court) decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/22/charles-schumer/campaign-finance-ruling-united-citizens-historical/	It's clear that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on campaign finance reform, allowing corporations to spend as much as they like on their own political ads, marked a major reversal of current campaign law. But according to leading Democrats, the ruling went much further than overturning recent law. "With a stroke of a pen, the court decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures and override the will of millions of Americans who want their voices heard in our democracy," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. Other Democrats echoed similar sentiments, that the Supreme Court has overruled more than a century of established law. This more-than-100-years talk confused us. We thought the Supreme Court ruling hinged on a recent campaign finance law, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., more formally referred to as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 -- and clearly less than 100 years old. So we decided to look into Schumer's statement. But first, a little bit more about the case, which was kicked off by Hillary: The Movie, a documentary film that portrays Clinton as deceitful, ideological and power-hungry. During the 2008 presidential campaign, a group called Citizens United wanted to promote the movie in the days leading up the election. But the Federal Election Commission said they couldn't do that; the 2002 campaign finance law banned corporations from "electioneering" -- running ads or messages that mentioned a specific candiate -- during the 30 days before a primary and 60 days before an election. The FEC said Citizens United could not promote the movie without violating the law. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, not only threw out the time limits for electioneering, but added that the federal government could not set limits on corporations spending whatever they wanted to promote their own political messages during campaigns. The ban violated free speech protections, the court said. So the ruling does go further than just ending the ban on electioneering. But how far back does it go? We asked Schumer's staff about the 100-year-old comment, and they pointed us toward a 1907 law called the Tillman Act. They cited the dissenting opinion issued this week, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, that said, "The majority’s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past. Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907." But as we dug deeper into the history of the Tillman Act, the picture got murky because of the difference between independent expenditures and direct contributions. An independent expenditure means money that corporations go out and spend on their own to portray a particular candidate as unfit for office, or on an issue. A direct contribution means a donation to a candidate's campaign, for the campaign to spend any way it likes. Corporations may not make direct contributions to federal campaigns from their own treasury; they have to create a separate political action committee, or PAC, for that. The recent ruling did nothing to change that ban. The Tillman Act said corporations could not "make a money contribution in connection with any election to any political office." Now, does this mean that independent expenditures are outlawed, or just direct contributions? We looked at several court opinions and legal articles, and everything we looked at suggested that back then, people weren't thinking of campaign contributions in those terms. And in 1947, Congress came back and passed another law, the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, banning corporations and unions from making independent expenditures. In fact, much of modern campaign finance laws dates to the post-Watergate period in the 1970s, when Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act and a series of amendments. That's when modern reporting requirements for campaigns were put into place, and the Federal Election Commission was established. A history on the Web site of the Federal Election Commission notes that before this the laws were largely ignored, "because none provided an institutional framework to administer their provisions effectively." So what about Schumer's comments that the Supreme Court "decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures." This glosses over a lot of detail. Yes, it was more than 100 years ago that the first law limiting corporate spending was passed. But we don't see evidence that the Tillman Act even envisioned a distinction between direct contributions and independent expenditures. And the ban on direct contributions still stands. Perhaps some of you are probably thinking, what's the difference? So what if a company can't contribute directly to a candidate if it can run ads about what a great person Joe is. Well, in practice, it's an important distinction. Corporations aren't allowed to coordinate their ads with the campaigns, and campaigns have their own ideas of messaging and strategy. In his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe discussed in detail why spending by groups outside the campaign is less effective than commonly thought. We also don't want to downplay the historical importance of the Citizens United ruling. The Citizens United case does overturn some notable precedents and laws. The majority opinion specifically said it was overturning a 1990 precedent, Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which said that the federal government could regulate corporate spending as laid out in the reforms of the 1970s. You could also argue that the Citizens United case overturns the campaign finance portion of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. Schumer said the Supreme Court "decided to overrule the 100-year-old ban on corporate expenditures." But he ignores the fact that the ban on direct donations from corporations to campaigns still exists. And the oldest law that specifically banned independent expenditures dated to 1947. You could also argue that we should be dating this from the 1970s campaign finance laws, or even the 1990 Austin case. So he's exaggerating the scope of the ruling and how long the laws have been on the books. We rate Schumer's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09948	"Sotomayor has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/27/libertarian-national-committee/libertarian-party-claims-sonia-sotomayor-has-had-f/	Shortly after President Barack Obama announced Sonia Sotomayor as his pick for the Supreme Court, conservatives pulled this bit out of their arsenal: Sotomayor is not up to the job because some of her cases have been thrown out by the Supreme Court. Wendy E. Long of the Judicial Confirmation Network was one of the first to knock Sotomayor's record, saying that she "has an extremely high rate of her decisions being reversed, indicating that she is far more of a liberal activist than even the current liberal activist Supreme Court." Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America echoed that talking point, saying that Sotomayor's "high reversal rate alone should be enough for us to pause and take a good look at her record." Then there was this from the Libertarian National Committee: " Sotomayor has had her rulings thrown out by the court a troubling four times." We learned pretty quickly that the veracity of this statement depends on a few variables. Let's start by looking at Sotomayor's 11-year tenure on the 2 nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We found that she has authored hundreds of officially published majority opinions — the White House puts the exact number at 380 — and of those, six have been heard by the Supreme Court. Three have been reversed: Riverkeeper Inc. vs. EPA ; Merrill Lynch vs. Dabit ; and Malesko vs. Correctional Services Corp . Among the other three cases: The Supreme Court affirmed her ruling in Empire Healthchoice Assurance Inc. vs. McVeigh . It affirmed her ruling but but unanimously rejected her reasoning in Knight vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue . The sixth case, Ricci vs. DeStefano , is still pending. So her record so far at the appellate level is three reversals, two upheld and one pending. There's also her time on the U.S. District Court between 1992 and 1998. One of her rulings, Tasini vs. New York Times, et al. , was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1997. That's how the Libertarian Party gets to its total of four reversed opinions. Keep in mind that other Supreme Court justices have seen their share of reversals. For the sake of comparison, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, like Sotomayor, wrote hundreds of majority opinions during his 16-year tenure on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least two of those were heard by the Supreme Court and both were reversed: Jo Anne B. Barnhart , Commissioner of Social Security, Petitioner vs. Pauline Thomas and Rompilla vs. Beard . We were also caught up by the word "troubling" in the Libertarian Party's statement, so we turned to Stephen Wermiel , a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, for some perspective. In fact, the Supreme Court increasingly has a reputation for reversing most of the approximately 80 cases it hears every term, Wermiel said. Indeed, according to data compiled by SCOTUSblog .com, the Supreme Court's reversal rate in 2008 was 85 percent, 61 percent in 2007, and 72 percent in 2006. Having a case reversed "is not a badge of shame, or a stigma of stupidity or inferiority," Wermiel said. "It's a sign that reasonable minds had a different approach to the issue." Tom Goldstein , a partner at law firm Akin Gump and author of SCOTUSblog .com, agreed. "In a career as long as [ Sotomayor's ], she's easily in the mainstream," compared to the reversal rate of other judges. "The numbers game is childish," said Michael Greve, a legal scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "You are dealing with all of six cases. What of it?" The best way to evaluate Sotomayor — or anyone else nominated to the highest court — is to look at individual opinions, he added. So the Libertarian Party is correct that Sotomayor was reversed four times: three at the appellate level and one at the district court level. But this is out of hundreds of potential cases. Furthermore, the Libertarian Party's implication that four cases represents a high rate of reversal just doesn't hold up. Her record is not far off from another well-known justice, Samuel Alito , nor is it at all unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse most of the cases it hears every year, according to legal experts we spoke to. We rate their statement Half True.	None	Libertarian National Committee	None	None	None	2009-05-27T16:40:16	2009-05-26	['None']
pomt-09466	The Democrats' health care bills would end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition," while the Republican bill would not.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/03/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-says-democrats-tackle-preexisting-condition/	Few elements of today's health care system are as maddening to most Americans as the denial of insurance to those who suffer from pre-existing conditions. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from September 2009 found that eight of every 10 respondents -- including 67 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents and 88 percent of Democrats -- would support a requirement that insurance companies cover anyone who applies. So it's not surprising that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would tout her efforts to achieve that policy goal in a Feb. 28, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week. Sitting down with host Elizabeth Vargas, Pelosi outlined some differences between her approach and that of House Republicans. One example, she said, "is ending the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition. The Democrats have that in their bill. The Republicans do not." We looked at the bills and checked with experts across the ideological spectrum to gauge whether Pelosi is making a fair comparison. What we found is that both bills explicitly take on the issue of pre-existing conditions, but the policy prescriptions differ, complicating the process of analyzing Pelosi's claim. First we'll look at the Democratic bill. Most observers would agree that Pelosi is correct that the House bill -- which passed her chamber narrowly last year -- does indeed end the denial of coverage for those who have a pre-existing condition, though not without some caveats. The House bill -- in language later echoed by President Barack Obama's proposed bill -- bars the exclusion of applicants due to a pre-existing condition in three settings: in the individual market (that is, in policies bought separately by families and individuals), in the exchange (the new, virtual marketplace for purchasing insurance that would be set up by the bill), and in the small group market (policies purchased through small employers). One caveat is that this policy wouldn't take effect immediately; it would begin Jan. 1, 2014. Until the new rules kick in, individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months and have a pre-existing medical condition could enroll in a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. (Remember the term "high-risk pool" -- we'll encounter it again shortly.) There's a second caveat, too: Michael Cannon, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that the Democratic approach could have unintended consequences. While the law would bar outright rejections of applicants with pre-existing conditions, he said, there's nothing to stop insurance companies from treating such patients poorly, in the hope of foisting them -- and their higher health care bills -- on their competitors. Indeed, Cannon suggests, a failure to act this way could endanger the very economic viability of these insurers. "The Democratic bills create such perverse incentives for insurers to offer inadequate care and lousy customer service that sick people with insurance may feel like the bill made things worse," Cannon said. Still, even taking into account these caveats, there's ample evidence that Pelosi is on solid ground when she states that the Democratic bill "would end 'the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition' " -- though it might take a few years to get there. What about the Republican bill? The bill in question is an amendment offered by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was voted down along party lines shortly before the Democratic bill passed. This measure explicitly targets the issue of pre-existing conditions -- in fact, in the bill's preamble, it says the purpose of the act "is to take meaningful steps to lower health care costs and increase access to health insurance coverage (especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions)." However, it goes about it in a very different way from the Democratic bill -- and that led our sources to vary widely in their assessments of Pelosi's claim. Rather than outlawing such denials by insurance companies, the Republican bill would instead make sure that those with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage -- somewhere. It would do this by creating -- here's that phrase again -- "high-risk pools." These pools would guarantee those with pre-existing conditions an offer of coverage. The Republican bill would also cap the premiums charged by such pools and provide funding to help states manage them. Now, it's true that the Democratic approach also uses high-risk pools. But the architects of the Democratic bills envision them as a stopgap solution. The Republican measure, by contrast, considers them the permanent solution. And many health care experts say that high-risk pools are too flawed a concept to be relied upon over the long term. This belief is based on a track record from more than two dozen states that have implemented high-risk pools. Health economists often talk about "community rating" -- the idea that premiums can be kept down if you insure a large enough and diverse enough pool of people. This happens because those who are healthier (and cheaper to cover) effectively subsidize those who are sicker (and more expensive). But by their very nature, high-risk pools are not diverse. They take the sickest and most expensive patients who are not already covered by Medicare, Medicaid or another type of health plan. By concentrating sicker patients in the same plan, these pools can't rely on healthier, cheaper patients to shoulder the cost burden. So high-risk pools usually face steep costs and, in turn, steep premiums for beneficiaries (or for the government entities that subsidize those beneficiaries). These high costs have limited the appeal of high-risk pools. According to Pelosi's office, only about 200,000 Americans belong to the existing state high-risk pools -- a tiny fraction of the 46 million uninsured Americans. The Republican bill's incentives could boost enrollment, but to truly become a long-term solution would require significant subsidies -- more, critics say, than the Republican bill provides. Jonathan Cohn, a health care journalist, recently wrote in the New Republic, a liberal magazine, that the GOP bill "sets aside about $4 billion a year when fully phased in. By comparison, when John McCain proposed creating high-risk pools in the 2008 presidential campaign, his economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated it would take between $7 billion and $10 billion a year to cover all of the medically uninsurable through them." So, what to make of this? We feel reasonably confident about two things. One is that the GOP approach doesn't explicitly end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition," as Pelosi indicated. Insurers would still be able to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions; the policy would instead allow those who are rejected to be provided access to coverage elsewhere. The second is that while it's impossible to know whether the Republican approach would succeed or fail, it's clear that many health experts are skeptical about the GOP's ability to provide coverage to all or virtually all of those who have pre-existing conditions. Ultimately, both parties' approaches have their critics. But we believe that, despite some caveats, Pelosi is basically correct in saying that the Democratic approach would explicitly end "the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition." As for Pelosi's belief that the Republican approach fails to do the same, she unfairly glosses over the fact that the GOP proposal makes it a high-priority goal and that it provides a path (albeit a controversial one) to get there. Still, Pelosi is correct that under the GOP plan, insurers would still be able to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. On balance, then, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-13524	"Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-illegal-immigration-costs-113-bi/	In his speech in Arizona, Donald Trump outlined all the ways he plans to address illegal immigration if elected to the White House. The United States has to act, he said Aug. 31, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. "Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get," Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. "For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting." We wondered if illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion a year. We asked Trump’s campaign for the source of his data but did not hear back. Fox News’ Sean Hannity presented the $113 billion figure a few days earlier in a town hall interview with Trump, citing a 2013 report from Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group seeking reduced immigration. FAIR’s report says $113 billion represents the total cost at the federal, state and local levels for undocumented immigrants. The vast majority -- $84 billion -- is paid by state and local governments. The $113 billion is not a net cost. Taking into consideration federal, state and local tax payments made by the undocumented population, the net cost would be about $99 billion, according to the FAIR report. The report details federal expenses for education, medical treatment, law enforcement, public assistance and general expenditures covering people here illegally. General expenses include "non-enumerated functions of government," such as the cost of fire departments or of the legislature, the report said. FAIR based its estimates on a pool of 13 million people in the country illegally. It includes at least 3.4 million children who are U.S. citizens born to undocumented parents. That total estimate is higher than figures estimated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, about 11.4 million by January 2012. Pew Research Center estimated there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in 2014. Before Trump, other Republican officials have used FAIR reports to bolster arguments about the fiscal costs of undocumented immigrants on their state. (PolitiFact has rated similar but state-centric claims in Florida and New Jersey as False, another claim Mostly False in Oregon, and one Half True in Georgia.) One thing we’ve been told over the years: FAIR’s conclusions stem from inexact estimates and assumptions. American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant think tank, said a previous FAIR report about this topic in 2010 relied "upon flawed and empirically baseless assumptions to inflate its estimate of the costs." In its estimated health care costs, we’ve found FAIR used a survey of hospitals that includes private hospitals, which are not funded by the state government. And its reports have assumed that most students enrolled in English learning classes are children of undocumented immigrants. That’s because "legal immigrants have often studied in the United States or otherwise learned English before immigrating and raise their children to speak English," the 2013 report says. Regarding the inclusion of education expenses for U.S. born children, "Without regard to whether this estimate is accurate, the concept of this being a ‘cost’ attributable to the unauthorized immigrants is subject to debate," said Jeff Passel, a senior demographer at Pew Research Center. The 2013 FAIR study also includes about $2.47 billion in fraudulent use of Medicaid, though it said only anecdotal information is available. FAIR also includes incarceration costs for undocumented immigrants. But federal agencies and immigration experts have told us there’s no definitive source for the total number of inmates in the country illegally. FAIR says it bases its incarceration costs on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. The program reimburses states and localities for costs related to incarceration of undocumented criminal immigrants "with at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days during the reporting period," according to the U.S. Department of Justice. "The quibbling about our use of estimates is ludicrous," said Jack Martin, FAIR spokesperson. "All analysis of the impact of illegal aliens is based on estimates. The closest to survey data is the SCAAP data filed by state and local governments. We responsibly noted where we used estimates and why we thought they were reasonable estimates." It’s difficult to determine exact costs of a population for which only estimates are available. Other, lower estimates Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies, said the cost of illegal immigration is not known for sure but could be under $113 billion. He pointed us to another report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Households led by undocumented immigrants received about $85 billion a year in benefits in 2010, according to the report. The Heritage Foundation report found that in 2010, there were about 3.44 million households headed by undocumented immigrants and on average, each household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services, such as public education, police and fire protection. That report also takes into account expenses tied to some U.S. citizens -- about 4 million children born in the United States to parents living in the country illegally. "These children would not reside in the U.S. if their parents had not chosen to enter and remain in the nation unlawfully," the report said. "Obviously, any analysis of the fiscal cost of unlawful immigration must therefore include the costs associated with these children, because those costs are a direct and inevitable result of the unlawful immigration of the parents." Fiscal concerns related to undocumented immigrants are driven by a disparity in services they use and taxes they pay, Camarota said. "Most immigrants come to work, including illegal immigrants," Camarota said. "Illegal immigrants are a fiscal drain not because they are illegal or immigrants, or lazy and don’t work, but because people at that level of education use a lot in social services and pay little in taxes." About 50 percent of adult undocumented immigrants have less than a high school education, in comparison to about 8 percent of the U.S. born-adult population who have not graduated from high school, Pew Research Center has found. According to the Heritage report, the average household led by an undocumented immigrant without a high school degree in 2010 paid around $8,860 in taxes, compared to about $10,900 in taxes paid by a household led by a non-immigrant without a high school degree. Overall, households of all educational levels led by undocumented immigrants paid about $10,300 in 2010, according to Heritage. Costs of the unauthorized population have been debated before, though recent, nonpartisan estimates are scarce. In 1995, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that a professor emeritus of economics had pegged the net cost of undocumented immigrants to federal, state and local governments at $11.9 billion in 1992. A review of the professor’s work published in 1994 by the Urban Institute, a policy research organization, rebutted that amount, adjusting it to $1.9 billion. The professor, Donald Huddle, in a separate exercise estimated net costs between $16 billion and $21.6 billion for 1994, the GAO report noted. The 1994 range of estimates assumed an undocumented population between 4 million and 5.4 million. (Huddle also rebutted the Urban Institute’s rebuttal.) "Because little data are available on illegal aliens’ use of public services and tax payments, the various indirect approaches used to estimate costs and revenues were often based on assumptions whose reasonableness is unknown," the report said. "A great deal of uncertainty remains about the actual national fiscal impact of illegal aliens." A 2007 report from the Congressional Budget Office examined the impact of unauthorized immigrants on state and local governments and found that they pay less in taxes than what they receive through state and local public services. It also noted they are prohibited from many federal benefits. The Congressional Budget Office report analyzed 29 reports and said none attempted to look at total costs and revenues. Estimates that don’t factor in positive economic impacts by unauthorized immigrants don’t tell the whole story, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration trends. She noted that the Social Security Administration reported that in 2010 unauthorized immigrants paid a net $12 billion into the trust funds. Our ruling Trump said, "Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year." Trump presented this figure as a hard fact to make his case, and not as the rough, high-end estimate that it is. The figure matches a 2013 study by a group that wants to reduce immigration, FAIR. It’s uncertain how much immigrants in the United States illegally cost taxpayers, but FAIR’s data is largely based on broad estimates and assumptions. Another report by a conservative think tank pegged the amount at about $85 billion a year. Reports by pro-immigration or neutral groups have come in significantly lower, and other reports have been inconclusive. Estimating the costs of illegal immigration is extremely difficult and produces dramatically different figures, depending on the source. Yes, there are costs. But Trump is selecting the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varies widely. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-13727	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "opposes faster broadband internet in small towns" and "got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democrats-claim-ron-johnson-opposes-fast/	In June 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson aired a TV ad emphasizing his humble beginnings as a dishwasher and machine operator. The next day, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin released a radio ad arguing just the opposite. The ad painted the Republican Johnson as a "multi-millionaire CEO turned Senator" out of touch with the needs of Wisconsinites living in rural areas. "Living in the country doesn’t mean we should have fewer opportunities," the speaker says. "Unfortunately, that’s what Wisconsin gets with Sen. Ron Johnson." Later the speaker says: "He opposes faster broadband internet in small towns. Maybe because he got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests." Former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, running against Johnson, has argued for rural broadband to be more like a public utility. Johnson opposes that idea. But that doesn’t mean he opposes bringing faster broadband to rural areas. Let’s examine the two parts of the claim one at a time. Faster internet in rural small towns Many Wisconsinites in rural areas lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. While the Federal Communications Commission has said maximizing access to broadband internet is a priority, there is widespread disagreement about how to pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed to make it a reality. Harry Hartfield, communications director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Johnson’s voting record demonstrates he opposes to faster broadband in rural areas. He pointed to two votes in particular: In 2012, Johnson voted for a Senate bill amendment that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase the amount of federal grants to provide broadband access in rural areas. In 2013, Johnson voted against a Senate bill amendment that established a pilot program to expand high speed broadband service to rural areas. "If (Johnson) supported faster internet in rural communities, he would have supported legislation that did just that," Hartfield said. Hartfield also noted Johnson and five other Republican senators argued the definition of broadband was "too fast" in a 2016 letter to the FCC chairman, since few applications require download speeds of 25 Mbps, the new standard. They gave the example of Netflix, which recommends download speeds of 5 Mbps to stream high-definition video. The letter’s authors said they worried increased regulation as a result of the standard would disincentivize telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds. Barry Orton, a professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that most households have more than one person using the internet at once, which makes faster speeds necessary. "Why are they writing a letter saying don’t expand the broadband definition?" said Orton, who helped Feingold’s campaign develop its broadband materials. "Because expansion of the broadband definition doesn’t help existing providers that are offering less than that." For its part, Johnson’s campaign says he supports increased broadband connectivity — but wants the private sector deliver the services. "Ron has worked on a bipartisan basis to create an environment where more broadband companies can invest and innovate to provide better internet access and more choice across Wisconsin," Johnson’s campaign said in an April statement. Campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger provided two additional letters to support this stance. A 2013 letter signed by Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, urged the FCC to finalize its plan to distribute funds for deployment of broadband to rural areas. A 2014 letter signed by more than 40 senators asked the FCC to carefully update rules governing broadband in rural areas to encourage competition. So, while the party cited two votes, it did not give a full picture of Johnson’s record on the matter. Indeed, there may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Contributions from telecom special interests The ad also claims Johnson’s campaign got "nearly $90,000" in contributions from telecommunications special interests. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin cited OpenSecrets.org, a website that pulls from Federal Election Committee data, which shows Johnson received at least $95,000 in contributions since 2010 from political action committees representing "telecom services" companies, including AT&T, Charter and Comcast. Our rating The Democratic Party’s radio ad said Johnson "opposes faster broadband internet in small towns" and he "got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests." Johnson’s voting record shows he opposed two particular proposals to grow faster broadband in rural areas and one signed letter to the FCC showed he was against a faster definition of broadband. But two other letters to the FCC suggest he’s in favor of faster rural broadband — but concerned with its execution. Johnson’s campaign has said he supports using the private sector to grow rural broadband. The second part of the claim is on point — Johnson actually received somewhat more from the industry than the ad claimed. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c81ce84-1d39-472e-ace6-9051b26d8d36	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2016-07-27T05:00:00	2016-06-23	['United_States']
pomt-04921	Says U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde has ‘no problem with raising taxes.’	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/01/club-growth/club-growth-says-hovde-has-no-problem-raising-taxe/	Trying to boost Republican Mark Neumann’s bid for U.S. Senate, a national conservative group is blasting away at Neumann rivals Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde. The message: Both are big taxers. The national Club for Growth, which has endorsed Neumann, uses a widely aired TV ad to highlight nine instances of tax increases during Tommy Thompson’s 14 years as Wisconsin governor -- years marked, as we found in rating a Thompson claim Mostly True, by a decline in the overall tax burden. The group had a much smaller record to comb through on Hovde, a banker and investment-fund manager and first-time candidate. "In a national TV interview, Hovde said he had no problem with raising taxes," the ad says. "And Hovde supported tax-raising Gov. Jim Doyle. On taxes, Hovde’s like Thompson, only worse." The ad shows a smiling Hovde at the start of a 2009 TV appearance as a financial pundit on CNBC’s "Squawk Box" beneath the words: "No Problem Raising Taxes." Hovde fired back with his own TV spot that calls the Neumann (actually Club for Growth’s) tax accusation "false." (The campaign acknowledges Hovde gave $500 to Democrat Doyle’s re-election campaign in 2005. It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.) So, did Hovde’s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes? We watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable show’s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the group’s ad. The background Hovde’s March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. Hovde said the country was in a "depression," Obama’s stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into "quasi-Socialist" territory. At the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice reported in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration. Unprompted, he began: "Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. I’ve been blessed in my life and I’ve been very fortunate. But some of the things that they’ve done are just insane." Then he referred to an Obama 2009 proposal to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000. "Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I don’t need it, but a lot of other people do." Hovde said. "We’re in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?" So, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had "no problem with raising taxes." He actually said: "I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes." That’s a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession. The timing is also important. In 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected. An candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother. It’s also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts? When asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovde’s personal tax bill to rise. As a candidate in 2012, Hovde told Bice he was not referring to Obama’s so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race). Hovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on "carried interest" -- the portion of a fund’s investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists. In an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year. But let’s look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012. Hovde has pledged to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax. So Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in people’s tax bills. That leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue. Hovde says he would vote to eliminate "nearly all" of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated. And he told us he still favors eliminating the "carried interest" tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole. Hovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions. He told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates. He said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed. But does that constitute a tax increase? Even conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reform’s widely publicized "taxpayer protection pledge" frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has criticized the group’s pledge as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code. PolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a Mitt Romney claim that Obama "has raised taxes 19 times." Views differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases. Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us it’s case by case -- some of these "tax preferences" are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise. Given Hovde’s pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the "carried interest" provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group. Our conclusion The national Club for Growth used Hovde’s own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes. Hovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. There’s no other way to read it. But the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted. In the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesn’t square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having "no problem raising taxes." The Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression. We think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim. Mostly False.

pomt-03315	Says residents of Texas and San Antonio can be fired or denied jobs because they are gay.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/26/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-residents-texas-and-san-/	In a June 14, 2013, opinion article in the San Antonio Express-News, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte urged the city to "pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or veterans' status." Supporting the measures, which the City Council was expected to consider in August 2013, the Democrat said of a fellow San Antonio resident, an Iraq veteran: "Here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay." We figured Van de Putte was making a broad statement about all Texans and all San Antonians; a spokesman for the senator, Lee Nichols, confirmed that. Like nearly all U.S. states, Texas is an employment-at-will state. That means, as the Texas Municipal League puts it in a legal white paper, "Generally, employees without a written employment contract can be fired for good cause, bad cause, or no cause at all," as long as that cause is not illegal. Section 21.051 of the Texas Labor Code, Nichols said via email, makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees or applicants because of "race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age," but does not mention sexual orientation. Van de Putte offered a bill during the 2013 Legislature’s regular session to extend that protection, he said. Here’s the law, part of the Texas Labor Code’s Title 2, Subtitle A, Chapter 21: SUBCHAPTER B. UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES Sec. 21.051. DISCRIMINATION BY EMPLOYER. An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer: (1) fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment; or (2) limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any other manner the status of an employee. So while it’s illegal in Texas to "deprive an individual of any employment opportunity" or refuse to hire someone because of gender, race and several other factors, it isn’t against state law to do so because they are homosexual or of any other sexual orientation. Spokesman Charlie Joughin at the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights group, told us 21 states have laws meant to protect residents against job discrimination based on sexual orientation. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that "in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for … being gay," as Martina Navratilova claimed in a May 2013 interview. PolitiFact rated the ex-tennis star’s statement Half True, noting significant exceptions. In all states, federal and state government employees have certain protections because courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit a discrimination lawsuit under the right of equal protection in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. PolitiFact also noted that cities or individual employers can have anti-discrimination policies even if their state does not. That’s the case in several Texas cities. City of Austin spokeswoman Patricia Fraga told us by phone that Austin ordinances protect against discrimination citywide in employment, housing and public accommodations -- a term that takes in businesses such as restaurants, theaters, bars and stores -- for reasons that include sexual orientation. Ordinances in Dallas and Fort Worth bar such discrimination citywide. Houston has several related ordinances, spokesman Justin Concepcion of the mayor’s office told us by phone. El Paso has a citywide ordinance against housing and public accommodation discrimination for sexual orientation, but not employment, deputy city attorney Laura Gordon told us by phone. San Antonio’s website advises its employees, "Unlawful discrimination may be occurring if you are treated differently because of" reasons that include sexual orientation. The proposed measures were described by the Express-News in a July 25, 2013, news blog entry as a "proposal to fix the city’s anti-discrimination policies, which right now are a hodgepodge of disparate references scattered across the city’s code." Van de Putte spokesman Servando Esparza told us by phone that protections at the city level were important, but not a comprehensive guarantee of rights, because a resident could move or rules could change as new city officials came in. "We wanted to make sure this was solved at the state level," he said. Our ruling Van de Putte said that a Texan and San Antonian could be "denied or fired from a job just because he is gay." In Texas, it appears, many workers can be fired for nearly any reason. That said, state law also doesn’t bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. But several major cities do and Texans who work for state or federal government -- and even for San Antonio city government itself -- have some protections, too. We rate this statement, which does not account for these important details, as Half True.	None	Leticia Van de Putte	None	None	None	2013-07-26T18:40:48	2013-06-14	['San_Antonio', 'Texas']
pomt-09750	About 750,000 people die in China each year from auto emissions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/08/nancy-pelosi/car-pollution-china-doesnt-cause-many-deaths-nany-/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long considered herself a human rights activist and an environmental advocate. So during a recent trip to China, Pelosi discussed how the issues overlap during a meeting with the country's president, Hu Jintao. She recounted the meeting for television host Charlie Rose on the Oct. 5, 2009, edition of his show. "I took a little bit of a different approach this time in terms of talking about environmental justice because . . . 750,000 people, approximately, die in China each year from auto emissions. The Gobi Desert is encroaching on the rest of China. There are sandstorms in Beijing. They know that . . . there's something that has to be done about climate change and environmental protection and that — and so my pitch to them is there has to be environmental justice. As you develop and as you compete, you can't leave people behind." We wondered if the death toll from auto emissions could possibly be as high as Pelosi claims. But first, some background. Most scientists believe that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide, are due in part to the number of cars on the road that do not burn fuel efficiently. Our cars release greenhouse gases that trap heat from the sun and have caused the Earth to warm. There's also evidence that the heat-trapping qualities of greenhouse gases lead to an increase of particulate matter and carcinogens in the atmosphere — bad news for those with asthma and other respiratory illnesses. We called Pelosi's office and they pointed us to 2007 news reports about a World Bank analysis that focused on the cost of pollution in China. According to the Financial Times, the Chinese government asked the World Bank to exclude information about how many people die each year as the result of air and water pollution. (For its part, the World Bank says the numbers were left out due to "some uncertainties about calculation methods and its application.") "Missing from this report are the research project’s findings that high air-pollution levels in Chinese cities (are) leading to the premature deaths of 350,000-400,000 people each year," the July 2, 2007, Financial Times story said. "A further 300,000 people die prematurely each year from exposure to poor air indoors, according to advisers, but little discussion of this issue survived in the report because it was outside the ambit of the Chinese ministries which sponsored the research." On top of that, 60,000 premature deaths were related to poor-quality water that resulted in diarrhea, and stomach, liver and bladder cancers, according to the story. So, Pelosi is relying on a news story's summary of World Bank data that was not officially published but that was obtained by the Financial Times. According to the news story, on the high end, there are 760,000 deaths annually from water and air pollution, not just auto emissions, as Pelosi said on the Charlie Rose Show. We took a look at the report, and found that it provided a lot of compelling evidence that Chinese citizens suffer a great deal from air and water pollution and that smog and dirty water in that country lead to many premature deaths. But it offered no overall numbers, nor did it focus specifically on auto emissions. "Energy consumption, especially coal consumption, is the main source of air pollutants," the report said, noting that medical evidence suggests "outdoor air pollution is a contributing cause of morbidity and mortality." To get another perspective, we called Mark Jacobson, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford University, who has studied death rates due to carbon dioxide pollution. In 2008, he found that for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about 1,000 additional deaths in the United States, and 20,000 worldwide. That's on top of the approximately 2 million air pollution-related deaths worldwide, he explained, citing numbers from the World Health Organization. "Home heating and cooking are really the biggest source of deaths," Jacobson said, explaining that, particularly in China, India and other developing countries, cooking is often done with animal dung, wood or coal. "There's a lot of smoke, no ventilation." Indeed, most pollution-related deaths — about 1.6 million of the 2 million overall, according to the WHO — are the result of poor indoor air quality. According to WHO's numbers, that leaves only about 400,000 deaths annually that stem from outdoor pollution — worldwide. Furthermore, outdoor air pollution isn't limited to auto emissions. Much of it comes from agricultural operations, electricity generation and industries that rely heavily on fossil fuels, Jacobson said. So to summarize: Pelosi said that about 750,000 people in China die annually from auto emissions. But she was basing her claim on news reports that relied on data that was never actually published. (When we inquired, the World Bank declined to directly address the statistics.) So even if the World Bank data is correct, Pelosi misinterpreted it by saying that all those deaths are related to auto emissions. On top of that, the World Health Organization estimates that most pollution-related deaths are the result of indoor pollutants (those coal and wood fires we mentioned above), not outdoor ones. So while Pelosi is correct that air pollution is harmful and may be responsible for many deaths in China, she's wrong to say that auto emissions are specifically responsible for 750,000 of them annually. We rate her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11866	"It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation."	false	/california/statements/2017/nov/01/john-cox/does-california-spend-nearly-five-times-much-build/	It’s not cheap to build anything in California. Land and labor is expensive and the state has some of the strictest environmental permitting rules anywhere. Those factors all drive up the cost of building homes, stores and even roads. Republican candidate for governor John Cox has pledged that, if elected, he’ll hack through California’s thicket of regulations, in an effort to reduce expenses. Specifically, Cox wants to reform the California Department of Transportation, or Caltrans, an agency he has described as overstaffed and wasteful. Recently, he claimed Caltrans spends an exorbitant amount to build and maintain each mile of roadway compared with other states. "It costs nearly five times as much in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation," Cox said in an interview published on the Political Vanguard website on Oct. 19, 2017. Cox made a similar claim in a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed on Oct. 18, 2017: "California spends 4.7 times the national average for every mile of roadway we build and maintain, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute." CEI is a libertarian think tank which sourced the statistic to the Reason Foundation, another free market think tank. Following both statements, Cox went on to advocate for greater reliance on private construction to reduce expenses. There’s a debate about why it’s so expensive to build roads in California. But we’re not fact-checking that debate. Instead, we’re zeroing in on Cox’s specific claims that California's road spending is "nearly five times" per mile compared with other states. Background on John Cox On his campaign website, Cox describes himself as a "Jack Kemp-style Republican who grew up on Chicago’s south-side." Today, he’s a San Diego businessman who "founded an organization that repairs the homes of low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities." His priorities, as listed on his website, include lowering California’s taxes and fighting the influence of special interests. Cox is the chairman of Give Voters a Voice, an effort to repeal California’s recent gas tax increase, which was signed into law this year to raise money for road repairs. The increase includes a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase, which went into effect this week. Our research We asked Cox’s campaign for evidence supporting his claims. It pointed to recent reports by the Reason Foundation, which studies transportation spending. In 2013, the foundation published its "20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems." That report shows California spent nearly $680,000 per mile in 2009 on roadways. That was 4.7 times as much as the national average of approximately $144,000 per mile spent in other states. That matches Cox’s claim of "nearly five times" as much. But our research shows, and Cox’s campaign has acknowledged, the information from 2009 is outdated. An updated 2016 Reason Foundation study shows California spent about $420,000 per mile in 2013 compared with the national average spending of about $160,000 per mile in the same year. That data places California’s spending at about 2.5 times the national average, far less than Cox’s claims. We asked Cox’s staff about the discrepancy. David Kersten, a policy analyst with the campaign, said the candidate didn’t have the most up-to-date figures. "When he wrote that (San Francisco Chronicle) op-ed, he didn’t have that new number," Kersten told us in an interview. "Everybody was using the older report." Matt Shupe, Cox’s campaign spokesman, said he and Kersten would update Cox on the new figure and use it in future statements. High admin costs Cox’s staff noted that one category of California’s road spending, administrative costs, totals nearly five times as much the national average, even in the 2016 report. We checked and the report does show that, though Cox’s staffers acknowledged that’s not the same statement the candidate made in the op-ed or in his Political Vanguard interview and at the center of this fact check. Caltrans, the agency targeted by Cox, disagrees with the methodology of the Reason Foundation studies. A Caltrans spokesman said much of the studies’ roadway data is from local streets and roads not built or maintained by the state. The spokesman also noted that California’s state roadways are larger and more congested than in other states, making them more expensive to build and maintain. Representatives for the Reason Foundation did not respond to our interview requests. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed it costs "nearly five times as much" in California to build and maintain a mile of road as it does in the rest of the nation. A study using 2009 data shows California spent 4.7 times as much per mile as the national average on roads. Updated data from 2013 shows the state’s spending still far above the national average at about 2.5 times the cost per mile, but far lower than Cox’s figure. Cox’s campaign staff told us the candidate relied on outdated information and would be updating this figure in future statements. While the candidate’s larger point about higher road spending in California appears to be correct, his specific claim about it being "nearly five times" as much per mile is outdated and wrong.

Bernie Sanders relishes his everyman persona, and during the Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn, he offered evidence that he’s out of place in the "millionaires’ club" that is the U.S. Senate. "I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate," Sanders said. Is that correct? We looked at the most frequently cited rundown of congressional wealth -- an annual study by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. We found that Sanders’ net worth does rank him in the bottom one-fifth of the 100-member chamber. Here’s a list showing Sanders and the 18 other senators whose net worth ranked below him for the 2014 calendar year. A negative value means liabilities greater than assets.: Senate net worth rank Senator Minimum net worth 82 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. $160,000 83 Mike Lee, R-Utah $120,000 84 Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. $120,000 85 Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. $90,000 86 John Thune, R-S.D. $80,000 87 James Lankford, R-Okla. -$10,000 88 Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. -$50,000 89 Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. -$80,000 90 Cory Gardner, R-Colo. -$110,000 91 Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. -$140,000 92 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -$160,000 93 Jack Reed, D-R.I. -$170,000 94 John Cornyn, R-Texas -$230,000 95 Mark Kirk, R-Ill. -$260,000 96 Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. -$350,000 97 Roger Wicker, R-Miss. -$450,000 98 Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii -$460,000 99 Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -$590,000 100 Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. -$720,000 We should note some caveats. The Roll Call survey is based on congressional financial disclosure forms, which offer the public only broad ranges of income in various categories. To determine the measurement it used in its ranking -- minimum net worth -- Roll Call used the total minimum reported value of the lawmakers’ assets minus the total minimum reported value of their liabilities. So the real amount could well be higher. In addition, the law exempts various types of holdings from disclosure, including the value of a primary residence, the value of personal possessions that aren’t held for investment purposes, and the value of retirement accounts. (The Center for Responsive Politics has a summary of what must be included in these forms here.) These factors led Roll Call to caution in its survey that "the disclosure forms are imperfect at best." Indeed, the data is vague enough that the differences between the net worths of the senators who cluster around Sanders verge on being indistinguishable. In fact, 10 other senators beyond the list of 18 above had a minimum net worth of less than $400,000 -- Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. That said, Sanders is largely correct that he’s on the lower end of the chamber’s income scale: The median senator, by Roll Call’s calculation, was $1.1 million, or almost seven times Sanders’ net worth. Our ruling Sanders said, "I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate." It’s important to remember that the financial-disclosure forms produce values too vague to be 100 percent certain of where each senator ranks in net worth. And with a minimum net worth of $160,000, we wouldn’t say Sanders is poor. That said, a credible calculation using financial disclosure forms put Sanders as having the 19th lowest net worth in the Senate.

pomt-09953	"President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/22/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-claims-blair-said-high-value-informati/	In a speech on national security, former Vice President Dick Cheney argued that despite all the controversy about the propriety of waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation" techniques used on terror suspects in the wake of 9/11, one fact has been lost — the techniques worked. And Cheney cited comments from an appointee of President Barack Obama to back up his point. "President Obama's own director of national intelligence, Admiral Blair, put it this way: 'High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country,' " Cheney said in a May 21, 2009, speech at the American Enterprise Institute. "Admiral Blair put that conclusion in writing, only to see it mysteriously deleted in a later version released by the administration, the missing 26 words that tell an inconvenient truth." Cheney is right about there being two different versions of an April 16 memo sent by Adm. Dennis C. Blair, President Obama’s director of national intelligence. In a private version of the memo sent to his colleagues, Blair says it's important to remember the context of events that led to the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. "All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain critical information from captured al-Qaida leaders, and requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods. ... High-value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided deeper understanding of the al-Qaida organization that was attacking this country." That last sentence wasn't included in an abbreviated form of the memo that was released to the public. You can check out both versions here . Here's another line that was cut: "I like to think I would not have approved those methods in the past, but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time." But the administration isn't the only one guilty of truncating Blair's full position. Cheney failed to mention this statement released by Blair on April 21, "I also strongly supported the president (Obama) when he declared that we would no longer use enhanced interrogation techniques. We do not need these techniques to keep America safe. The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances, but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means. The bottom line is these techniques have hurt our image around the world, the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefit they gave us and they are not essential to our national security." So Cheney mentioned the quote from Blair that the enhanced interrogations provided "high-value information," but failed to mention Blair's later clarification that while the techniques did provide information, there is no way of knowing if that information could have been obtained through other means. Cheney also failed to mention that Blair opposes the use of the controversial interrogation techniques, that he thinks the damage they have caused far outweigh the benefits gained and that they "are not essential to our national security." Cheney neglected to give a full account of Blair's comments. But even that additional context does not refute the core point that Cheney attributes to Blair. Even if Blair has misgivings about the techniques, he has still acknowledged the information from them "was valuable in some instances." We find Cheney's statement Mostly True.

pomt-13098	Kelly Ayotte "voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/nov/05/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-cut-90-billi/	As Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan traded barbs in their last debate before Tuesday’s election, the subject once again turned to the rising cost of higher education. Ayotte was asked why she had voted for "budget bills" that would have cut money for Pell Grants, the federal subsidy for needy undergraduates. "That’s just not true," she said. Ayotte said she voted to make "sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants." A little later, Hassan, who is running to unseat Ayotte, encouraged people to "check for themselves" regarding Ayotte’s votes. "On March 27, 2015, she voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion," Hassan said. PolitiFact decided to check it out -- did Ayotte, who often trumpets her support of Pell Grants, in fact vote to cut funding for the program? We reached out to both campaigns, as well as a couple federal budget policy experts. Hassan’s campaign pointed to Ayotte’s votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 -- in the Congressional Record, S. Con. Res. 11 -- and a proposed amendment to it. The first thing to note is that on March 27, 2015, Ayotte voted on a budget resolution -- which is a document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. It’s not a binding spending outline and does not initiate cuts itself. "It doesn’t have the effect of law, it doesn’t go to the President for signature. It’s also a broad ranging document that covers a ton of issues, so you could oppose a provision but support the package," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. It’s a packet of suggestions -- and, crucially, vague ones at that. Budget resolutions only set "top-line" numbers in broad spending categories the next budget shouldn’t go over. They never get so detailed as to discuss appropriations to individual programs -- including Pell Grants. And again, it’s non-binding. "You can’t really say it cuts a program or it doesn’t cut a program. That’s pretty impossible," said Jason Delisle, of the American Enterprise Institute. So where did the $90 billion figure come from? Hassan’s campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote on April 30, 2015, that the Republican’s budget resolution "eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program. That would either require significant cuts in other domestic priorities to make up for lost funding or result in deep cuts to the Pell program." But there’s something important to note about Donovan’s statement. It refers to "mandatory" funding. If a budget resolution suggests taking away a program’s "mandatory" spending, that still means the program can recover those funds through discretionary spending -- spending that Congress reviews every year. This is what Ayotte was referring to when she said she wanted to "make sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants." Of course, making a program’s spending subject to Congressional approval each year certainly makes it more vulnerable to actual cuts -- especially if total discretionary spending targets go down by $759 billion -- because it would compete for those other dollars in a smaller pool. And that’s why several higher education advocacy groups denounced the Republican budget plan. But strictly speaking, making a program’s funding discretionary doesn’t actually cut its spending. As noted by the Hassan campaign, Ayotte did vote against an amendment to the budget resolution, put forward by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. According to its statement of purpose, that amendment "(restored) the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal Pell Grants in the Republican budget." Republicans, who objected to the assumption their budget resolution would cut Pell Grants, universally voted against it, and Democrats universally voted for it. But Delisle also notes that while statement of purpose for Franken’s amendment made explicit mention of Pell Grants, the text of the amendment itself didn’t. Instead, it simply noted top-line budget categories in the resolution and increased the amount assigned to them. In short, the amendment made the assumption that by reducing or increasingly certain overall top-line spending targets, a certain amount would or wouldn’t trickle down to Pell Grants. But it didn’t actually point to a spot in the budget resolution where a certain amount of money was allocated to Pell Grants and assign more dollars to the program -- because that spot doesn’t exist. Our ruling Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte "voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion." What Ayotte voted on was a budget resolution, a broad outline for spending, which is non-specific and non-binding. It’s not the same as a vote for an actual budget, which dictates federal spending. Moreover, the resolution didn’t call for a cut to Pell Grants. It made the spending discretionary, rather than mandatory. The change would have made the grants more vulnerable, but it’s not the same as a cut . We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02229	"Eighty percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/17/louie-gohmert/texas-republican-rep-louie-gohmert-says-80-percent/	You’ll often hear Democratic politicians decry income inequality and the pattern of the rich getting richer. But at the New Hampshire Freedom Summit -- a gathering in Manchester, N.H., sponsored by the conservative groups Americans for Prosperity and Citizens United -- Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, got into the action, too. Gohmert, though, took aim at Democrats for hypocrisy. "The dirty little secret on Wall Street: Eighty percent of the Wall Street executives’ and their spouses' donations go to Democrats," Gohmert said. "It’s like they’ve got some kind of little sweet deal, where we’ll call you fat cats and demean you and stuff, but you will get richer than your wildest dreams. It’s time for that to stop." We wondered: Is it really true that "80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats"? We asked Gohmert’s office for their sourcing, and they provided several columns in the National Review by Michael Franc of the conservative Heritage Foundation. In one of them, Franc wrote that "a review of Federal Election Commission data for the current presidential-election cycle sheds light on this important question. Judging by who they support for president, a strong majority of employees at the highest reaches of Wall Street’s big financial institutions are, well, big liberals. More Wall Streeters shower far more money -- both overall as well as on average -- on the more liberal presidential candidates than on their more conservative alternatives." Franc wrote that he used Fundrace 2008, a campaign-finance data tool created by the Huffington Post, to look at donations from such employees as investment bankers, managing directors and senior managing directors. He found that at Bear Stearns, 68 percent of individual donations went to Democrats. At JPMorgan Chase, it was 75 percent. At Lehman Brothers, it was 69 percent. At Goldman Sachs, the Democratic share was more than two-thirds (Franc didn’t specify in his article), while at Morgan Stanley it was more than half. At American International Group, it was 76 percent. Indeed, among the firms Franc looked into, only individuals at Merrill Lynch gave a majority to Republicans. Right off the top, though, there’s an important caveat to how Gohmert portrayed Franc’s figures. Gohmert used the present tense, but -- as you might expect, given the presence of the now-defunct Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in the data and the use of a tool called "Fundrace 2008" -- Franc’s research was both conducted and published in 2008. Not only is that four campaign cycles ago, but there’s also been a sea change in Wall Street’s partisan preferences since then. The Center for Responsive Politics, which downloads Federal Election Commission disclosures by donors and candidates and sorts them into user-friendly categories, addressed this question in a 2013 report. The center wrote that Wall Street money, like much big money in politics, follows power, and after Democrats took control of the House and Senate in 2006, they began to increase their share of donations. "As recently as 2009, Democrats were collecting more campaign cash from Wall Street than Republicans," the center wrote. However, the center added, "that dynamic shifted at the end of 2009, with more money flowing to Republicans in 2010." And starting in 2011, the report continued, "the gap widened and Wall Street's financial support for one party (the GOP) began to tip the scales." In the 2012 campaign cycle, donations by individuals in the center’s "securities and investment" category -- the closest category to "Wall Street" -- were running 70 percent to Republicans, 30 percent to Democrats, and so far during the 2014 cycle, 63 percent of the industry’s money is going to Republicans, with 36 percent to Democrats. For individuals in the category "commercial banks," 71 percent of donations went to Republicans in 2012 and 74 percent so far in 2014. And for the umbrella category "finance, insurance, and real estate," 66 percent went to Republicans in 2012 and 58 percent so far in 2014. For each of these three categories, the year Franc based his data on -- 2008 -- was either the high point or close to the high point for Wall Street donors’ friendliness to Democrats (at least going back to 1990, when the center began collecting this data). Douglas Weber, a Center for Responsive Politics senior researcher, noted that Goldman Sachs had a clear Democratic edge in donations between 1990 and 2008, peaking at 2008 with 75 percent to Democrats in total giving (which, unlike Franc’s data above, includes political action committees and outside groups). But Goldman has since turned on a dime, with the share of donations to Democrats shifting to just 39 percent in 2010, 36 percent in 2012 and 34 percent so far in 2014. "Wall Street liked candidate Obama more than President Obama," Weber said. So by relying on Franc’s data from 2008, Gohmert isn’t just using old data -- he’s using the peak historical year for Democratic giving, and ignoring three subsequent cycles in which Wall Street tilted its donations in precisely the opposite direction. There are other problems with Gohmert’s claim beyond it being outdated: • None of Franc’s published data reaches 80 percent. Gohmert’s stated percentage exaggerates even what’s in Franc’s data. • Gohmert conflated "Democrats" with "Obama" and the presidential race with all races. Franc, unlike Gohmert, noted this in his piece that his analysis doesn’t "delve into employee contributions to candidates for the House and Senate." That means Franc’s study covers a much narrower slice of the data than one would assume just by hearing from Gohmert’s comment. When we reached Franc -- now an aide to House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. -- he didn’t defend the specific language Gohmert used. But he said he believes Gohmert’s underlying point -- that affluent "elites" lean Democratic, despite the party’s attacks "the rich" -- is fair. "If he mixed up the statistics in some way, it is the broader point that matters," Franc said. "Elites behave politically far differently than the conventional wisdom says they do. … The Democrats still overperform politically in congressional districts with heavy concentrations of wealth and post-graduate education." Our ruling Gohmert said that "80 percent of Wall Street executives and their spouses' donations go to Democrats." Gohmert would have had a stronger argument if he’d said that was the case six years ago, when candidate Barack Obama was vacuuming up Wall Street donations. The problem is, that’s no longer true. In fact, the exact opposite pattern has held for Wall Street donations during the past three election cycles. In addition, Gohmert overstated Franc’s percentages and ignored the difference between donations to Democratic presidential candidates and congressional candidates. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10538	Clinton said "great things about NAFTA until she started running for president."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/	In Ohio, where union workers are a major presence and the manufacturing economy is hurting, Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. Hillary Clinton for her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, called NAFTA. "Yesterday, Sen. Clinton also said I'm wrong to point out that she once supported NAFTA," Obama said. "But the fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president. A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, 'I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York state and America.' " The Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong, that Clinton was critical of NAFTA "long before she started running for president." We looked into Clinton's past remarks on NAFTA and concluded that she has changed her tune, from once speaking favorably about it to now saying the agreement needs "fixing." The agreement goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign when Bill Clinton ran against incumbent President George H.W. Bush. On Aug. 12 of that year, Bush finished negotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would support NAFTA if elected, but would demand supplemental agreements to protect worker rights, the environment and sudden import surges. After Clinton won the presidency, his administration negotiated the side agreements and made NAFTA one of its top priorities. Vice President Al Gore memorably debated Ross Perot about NAFTA on CNN's "Larry King Live." Congress approved the agreements, and it was hailed as a major political victory for the new president. As first lady, Hillary Clinton publicly supported her husband's position. In 1996, in a visit with unionized garment workers, she said the words Obama now quotes. "I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth," said Clinton, according to an Associated Press report. Clinton wrote positively of her husband's efforts on NAFTA in her memoir "Living History," published in 2003: "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal." During a 2004 teleconference on funding cuts for job training, Clinton was asked whether NAFTA should be revisited. She replied, "I think that we have to enforce the trade rules that are inherent" in NAFTA. "I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada," she said. Today, Clinton's campaign Web site says plainly, "NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises." At a debate hosted by CNN in November 2007, Clinton said, "NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout." We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically. However, this is not a point Clinton made in her own autobiography, where she wrote in favor of NAFTA. Now, there's the issue of whether Clinton changed her mind because she was running for president. Clinton surrogates say she made remarks against NAFTA as early as March 2000 when she was running for Senate in New York. We could not confirm those remarks independently. But, as we've noted, she made pro-NAFTA remarks as late as 2003 (her autobiography) and 2004 (a teleconference). We won't say Clinton was a huge cheerleader for NAFTA, but she did speak favorably of it. And now she says it needs to be fixed. Was running for president the cause of this switch, or was it a gradual change of thinking? It's hard to say; the balance of evidence does not point to a harsh pivot point. But when we balance her previous statements against her more recent statements, we find that she has changed her sentiments when she speaks about NAFTA. We rate Obama's charge True.

pomt-00562	Says "Florida is a model" for successful pretrial release programs.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/12/john-oliver/john-oliver-hails-pretrial-services-florida-progre/	Poking fun at Florida is oh-so-easy. So HBO host and news-comedian John Oliver surprised us, and maybe even himself, on Last Week Tonight when he hailed Florida as a model for the country for a component of its judicial system — and not for, say, assaults with a slice of pizza, or something like that. Oliver criticized the money-bail system that exists throughout most of the country in his June 7 episode, saying it leaves people who are too poor to make bail for non-violent offenses behind bars, which drives up jail costs and destroys livelihoods. As an alternative, Oliver made the case for pretrial service programs. With these services, he said, a person who is arrested would be interviewed by a specialist to see if he or she poses a flight risk or is dangerous. The specialist makes a recommendation to a judge, and the judge decides whether to send the person home, where he or she may be monitored with drug tests, ankle monitors and phone calls about court dates. "And pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country in places ranging from Oregon to Florida," Oliver said. "And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change." He added, "Did you know by the way that under Florida law, if you possess over 5 grams of meth, you can marry it. That’s a fact. That’s a legal fact. That’s an actual photo that ran in a newspaper’s wedding section in Florida. And yet even counties in Florida recognize that our money bail system is broken." As he described that "fact," this image appeared: For the record, it is not a "legal fact" that you can marry meth in Florida. That was a joke. However, we did want to unpack his more serious claim that Florida is a "model for progressive change" for its successful pretrial release programs. That wasn’t meant to be a joke. Oliver’s staff did not comment for this fact-check. Pretrial justice experts we consulted said while Florida has some positive things going for it, calling it a nationwide model is a bit of a stretch. Cherise Fanno Burdeen is executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, which supports alternatives to money bail. (The institute is also petitioning Gov. Andrew Cuomo to end New York’s money bail system after the suicide of Kalief Browder, who was kept in Rikers Island prison for three years without trial in part because he could not make bail after being accused of stealing a backpack). Burdeen, who said she spoke to Oliver’s team before the show, said she would not have hailed Florida as a progressive pretrial services model. Washington, D.C., and Kentucky, yes. Oregon and Colorado, sure. But Florida? "That’s probably not a statement I would make," Burdeen said. "It’s definitely more nuanced." In the mid 1970s, amid national reforms, some Florida counties started pretrial service programs — mainly because of jail overcrowding. Programs exist today in 29 of 67 counties. Not all states have done that, Burdeen said. But Florida does not offer pretrial services statewide, and "it certainly has a long way to go in terms of other needed components of reform," she said. One example: Only a few counties use accredited standards for assessing an arrested person’s flight risk and danger to the community before trial. The counties that are accredited by the Florida Corrections Accreditation Commission are Alachua, Broward, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange and Volusia, which combined are home to 7.2 million residents, or 36 percent of the state's estimated population. Florida could be considered loosely "progressive," Burdeen said, because pretrial programs exist in most counties where the vast majority of criminal case filings happen. In 2013, Miami-Dade County served more than 10,500 people, Broward County served more than 6,000, and Palm Beach, Polk and Pinellas counties served more than 5,000, according to the annual report of pretrial service programs in the state by the Florida Legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The point of the bail system is to ensure a defendant showed up for court, and sometimes the only way to do it is to keep him or her in jail, said Bob Dekle, University of Florida College of Law legal skills professor. "Florida’s model for pretrial detention and release is a fair, equitable model," he said. "I don’t know that it’s on the outer fringes of the avant garde in turning people loose from jail, and I rather doubt it, but I don’t believe that it is regressive. It’s just there and that’s what it is." For virtually all crimes except capital offenses, Florida law says the presumption of release should be on nonmonetary conditions. Still, Burdeen said most counties rely on a bond schedule for crimes. "If you can pay it out, you get out, if not you go to first appearance," she said. "Almost without a doubt the judge continues that amount from the schedule; if not, you back to your cell." Experts also pointed out that "pretrial services" means something different depending on the jurisdiction. In Florida’s Monroe County, home of the Florida Keys, pretrial services workers interview defendants, review their criminal histories and develop recommendations for a judge based on a point-scoring system that helps determine if they should be released on their own recognizance or released under supervision of the pretrial services agency. The judge can also choose to set a money bond amount. In Pinellas County, pretrial services are not run by a court or a county agency — they're run through the sheriff's office. When someone is arrested, booking deputies have the option of setting a recommended bond for an offense or a higher or lower bond depending on the circumstances. Often the low bond is to release the defendant at the jail on his or her own recognizance, known as ROR. If a defendant remains in jail until the first appearance, the judge could still decide to change the booking deputy's bond or recommend unsupervised or supervised ROR, which could include check-ins or electronic monitoring. When a judge is unsure, pretrial services staffers can conduct their own investigation into a defendant's background and advise the judge accordingly. "It's a very, very useful tool to manage the jail population," said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri. Spurgeon Kennedy, National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies vice president, said the vast majority of American counties do not have pretrial programs, so the fact that Florida has some is a positive in his group’s view. That said, the money-bail system remains prevalent and powerful throughout the state. "Unfortunately, Florida uses money primarily, and that’s the reason why we would hesitate to say what is happening in Florida is a model," Kennedy said. "But you do have these programs." Kennedy would look elsewhere for states closer to pretrial service utopia. In Washington, D.C., as Oliver also highlighted, the Pretrial Services Agency helps judges in the D.C. Superior Court and U.S. District Court by recommending release conditions for defendants that are based on their circumstances and are usually non-financial. And Kentucky abolished its commercial bail system in 1976, relying instead on a single statewide agency employing pretrial officers who interview people in jail and facilitate their release. Our ruling Oliver said "pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country," namely Florida, adding, "And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change." Experts in pretrial justice, several of whom talked with Oliver’s staff, said certain counties within Florida have demonstrated success with pretrial services as a way to reduce jail costs and eliminate overcrowding in jails. But they said he went a bit too far in leaving his viewers with the idea that Florida is among states that go above and beyond for defendants. There are pockets of progress, advocates said, but the commercial bail bonding industry is also strong in the state, and not every county has pretrial services. Oliver’s claim rates claim Half True.

pomt-01159	"Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/15/susan-stimpson/susan-stimpson-says-bill-howell-has-been-force-beh/	Susan Stimpson, former chairwoman of the Stafford County Board of Supervisors, recently announced her candidacy for the House of Delegates, challenging House Speaker William Howell in next year’s Republican primary. She said Howell, who has led the House since 2003, has abandoned conservatives. "Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade," she said in a Dec. 2 news release. "He has voted for them, he has engineered them and they are his legacy. Simply put, Bill Howell has lost his way and is the chief architect of a tax-and-spend agenda that rewards the politicians and punishes the middle class." It would be no small feat for Howell to be the force behind every state tax increase of the last decade and still manage to be re-elected as speaker every two years by the House’s Republican majority. So we examined Stimpson’s claim. Tim Edson, Stimpson’s spokesman, sent us vote records, news releases and articles that cover three major tax increase bills in 2004, 2007 and 2013. So let’s enter the Wayback Machine. 2004 Gov. Mark Warner proposed a $700 million a year tax increase to bolster education, public safety and health programs. The Senate went a few leaps further, adding transportation to the mix and approving a tax hike of almost $2 billion a year. Howell voiced opposition to both plans but never voted on them. The transportation bill was killed in the House Finance Committee. The tax standoff led to 115-day impasse in passing a two-year state budget. It was broken after moderate House Republicans crafted a compromise bill for a $615 million tax increase. The bill faced a major hurdle on April 6 when it came before the House Finance Committee. Stimpson points to articles in several newspapers the next day saying the legislation passed on a 10-8 vote after the Howell persuaded four anti-tax Republicans on the panel to skip the meeting. The speaker had been under pressure to allow the full House an opportunity to vote on the measure and, at the time, there appeared to ample votes to still kill it on the floor. A week later, however, the House approved the tax increase on a 52-46 vote when 17 rebellious Republicans joined forces with Democrats. Howell voted against the bill. The tax hike went on to pass the Senate and was signed by Warner. Howell would later strip three Republicans leaders of the tax compromise of some of their appointments to powerful committees and state commissions. 2007 Howell sponsored legislation to raise about $500 million a year for transportation, most of it by diverting funds that had helped pay for other services. But $158 million of the sum would come from raising fees on drivers and imposing heavy penalties on chronically bad drivers. The bill also gave Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads power to raise a combined $600 million more by establishing transportation commissions in their regions that would be authorized to raise taxes. Although the General Assembly approved the legislation, it had short-lived success. Less than a year later, lawmakers repealed the new penalties of bad drivers -- which could exceed $1,000 -- amid a public outcry. And the state Supreme Court struck down the regional transportation authorities, ruling that the legislature cannot delegate taxing power to unelected bodies. 2013 Howell sponsored a successful bill to raise about $750 million annually for transportation. Most of the money comes from a new tax on the wholesale price of gas, an increase in the state sales tax from 5 percent to 5.3 percent, and an increase in the motor vehicle sales tax from 3 percent to 4.3 percent. The bill also imposed a series of regional tax increases in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads -- including an 0.7 percent sales tax hike -- to help the congested areas raise a combined $680 million a year for transportation. Howell said he carried the bill to improve the safety of Virginia roads and because he was concerned transportation problems could undercut Virginia’s ability to recruit new corporations and retain the ones already here. Half of the 66 Republicans in the House voted for the measure, which was also backed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, also a Republican. Matt Moran, a spokesman for Howell, reminded us there were several large proposed tax hikes that the speaker opposed. Indeed, records show that Howell either voted or spoke out against $1 billion-plus tax increases former Gov. Tim Kaine unsuccessfully sought in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Our ruling Stimpson says "Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade." She’s right on the transportation tax bills that were passed in 2007 and 2013. Howell sponsored the measures and encouraged fellow House Republicans to vote for them. There’s complexity to the speaker’s role in the passage of the 2004 tax increase for education, public safety and health programs. Howell consistently spoke out against the bill and voted against it. But the bill survived a hostile House committee because Howell persuaded four conservative allies to skip the vote. This was a political miscalculation by the speaker rather than a nod of support. Howell was under pressure to let the full House vote on the measure. He was outmaneuvered a week later when 17 Republicans joined Democrats to narrowly pass the tax hike. Howell retaliated by stripping leaders of the GOP revolt of some duties. So we find Stimpson’s statement accurate, but in need of this clarification: Howell was an unwitting force behind one of the tax increases. We rate Stimpson’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05002	Says Mitt Romney’s carried interest income was a tax "trick."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-received-carried-int/	President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign continues to press the point that Mitt Romney made a lot of money in ways that most people don’t. On July 17, 2012, the campaign unveiled an ad in Pennsylvania, a swing state where Romney was making an appearance. The ad begins with a narrator saying, "Tax havens, offshore accounts, and carried interest. Mitt Romney has used every trick in the book." The last item in the list -- carried interest, which refers to a type of income typically earned by managers of hedge funds and private-equity firms -- caught our eye. We wondered whether the Obama camp was justified in calling carried interest a tax-limitation "trick." This one is a little technical, so we'll break it into pieces. What is carried interest? Private-equity firms (which buy, invest in, help manage and eventually sell companies) and hedge funds (which invest in a wide variety of markets) are run by managers on behalf of outside investors. When profits from a firm’s investments are disbursed, they are typically distributed according to each investor's stake. This income is taxed on each individual’s tax return, usually at the capital-gains rate of 15 percent. Fund managers may receive some income this way, but there’s a separate stream of income that is usually more lucrative for them. They often take 2 percent of the fund’s assets per year as a management fee, which is paid in cash and taxed at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, plus 20 percent of the profits as a performance-based bonus. The 20 percent portion is typically "carried over" for years at a time, often until the investment is closed out (thus the name, "carried interest"). This payment is taxed at capital gains rates of 15 percent -- less than if it were salary or wages. The hefty tax rate advantage for carried interest has spawned criticism. In the 2008 campaign, Obama promised to tax carried interest at the same rate as regular income, an effort we currently rate Stalled on our Obameter. The Congressional Research Service says the dispute boils down to opposing views of what carried interest represents. Obama and his allies say carried interest is essentially a management fee rather than investment profits from an ownership stake, and should be taxed like regular income. Opponents say it’s more like like investment income. It should not be surprising that Romney had carried interest income, since he co-founded and ran Bain Capital -- a private-equity firm. But this point was confirmed in an on-the-record call the Romney campaign set up with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012. Ben Ginsberg, an attorney for the Romney campaign, said on the conference call that "the amount from carried interest" earned by Romney "was $7.4 million in 2010 and $5.5 million in 2011." By having that income taxed at 15 percent rather than 35 percent meant that Romney may have saved more than over $2.5 million in taxes. Is carried interest a "trick"? We found differing opinions about whether it's accurate to describe it as "a trick." Some tax experts told us they think Obama’s use of the term "trick" is fair, because carried interest is a way to limit taxes that’s essentially limited to the very wealthy. "Given that the word ‘trick’ has no specific legal meaning in this context, I think it's fair game to call this one of the ‘tricks’ in the book," said Neil H. Buchanan, a law professor at George Washington University. "Each technique is different, and is used for a different specific tax advantage, but they're all among the list of things that wealthy people have at their disposal to cut their tax bills, that other people do not have available to them." Several other tax experts, however, thought the Obama camp went too far in using that term and in lumping carried interest together with tax havens and offshore accounts. They said the taxation of carried interest involves a pretty straightforward application of U.S. tax law. Offshore accounts and tax havens, by contrast, operate in the spaces between U.S. tax law, rather than as part of it. While there’s a dispute over whether the tax treatment of carried interest is smart policy, its legal standing is solid. Carried interest is a longstanding part of the tax code and applies in several areas of investment including real estate and gas and oil. Second, some argued that taxing carried interest as capital gains promotes entrepreneurial activity. Steve Judge, the president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a trade group for private equity funds, said carried interest is a way to reward risk takers in a way that tax havens do not. "They don’t have the purpose of incentivizing risk taking," Judge said. "That makes it inappropriate to blend carried interest with them." And third, carried interest isn’t really a tax strategy in the same way that using offshore accounts or tax havens is. Creating offshore accounts in tax havens can be put into effect quickly, if you are rich enough. As the Congressional Research Service notes, "The individual, using the Internet, can open a bank account in the name of a Cayman corporation that can be set up for a minimal fee. Money can be electronically transferred without any reporting to tax authorities, and investments can be made in the United States or abroad." But to benefit from the taxation of carried interest, you have to become a fund manager -- something that doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a career choice years in the making. Not even a fund’s investors get the benefits of carried interest -- it’s only the fund managers themselves. Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that as long as they are legal, none of the three techniques cited by the ad are really "tricks." "Carried interest is currently a legitimate way of reducing one's tax obligation," he said. "It may be unfair and distortionary; but it's not any more a ‘trick’ than taking advantage of the mortgage interest deduction. Congress ought to change the law so that carried interest is taxed at regular income rates. But until then. …" Our ruling The Obama campaign said Romney's use of carried interest is a "trick," but we find that's an exaggeration. "Trick" suggests something nefarious or twisting the tax code in a way that wasn't intended. But we found little to back that up. Using carried interes ist a legal, well-established part of the tax code that can’t be marshaled to dodge taxes by making a few quick mouse clicks on a Cayman Island website. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-07-18T11:58:09	2012-07-17	['None']

pomt-03351	Says in Texas "it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark."	false	/texas/statements/2013/jul/18/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-its-legal-texas-shoot-someone-cr/	Discussing the divide between states red and blue, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently said that Texans are allowed to shoot people who are causing a nuisance. "If you want to use a gun to kill someone who’s, say, spraypainting a highway underpass at night," Reich wrote in a June 8, 2013, blog post at robertreich.org, "you might want to go to Texas, where it’s legal to shoot someone who’s committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark." Reich, who headed the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, has a law degree and is now a University of California-Berkeley professor of public policy. He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago’s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. "Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft," he said. "Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return," he said, later adding, "It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws," the verdict means "it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance." In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is "one way" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert’s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich "is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law." The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one’s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person "reasonably believes" such force is necessary to prevent imminent "theft during the nighttime" or "criminal mischief during the nighttime." Jurors concluded that the "theft" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. "She was committing a scam," he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn’t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. "It is not open season on prostitutes" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. "This has gone, as you know, viral with ‘It’s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,’ ‘Stupid Texans and their guns,’ " he said. "Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted." As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, "You cannot under any circumstances do so." University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, "Reich, in my view, is simply wrong." Frago and Gilbert’s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. "What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money," he said. "In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than ‘just’ a contractual dispute," Dix said. "It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid." Even so, he said, "The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft." That’s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich’s assertion, the jury didn’t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it’s not a "public nuisance" in Texas law. It’s classified under "public indecency" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich’s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: "Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief," Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person’s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. "It’s a ridiculous statement." Dix said, "I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can ‘shoot someone who’s committing a "public nuisance" under the cover of dark.’ It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage." Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified "during the nighttime." Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone’s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because "sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless." Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, "it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a ‘public nuisance’ under the cover of dark," claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it’s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a "public nuisance" in Texas; and state law doesn’t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed. We rate the statement as False.

pomt-03015	A congressional laundry closed due to the partial government shutdown.	true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/14/roger-williams/capitol-hill-closures-due-partial-government-shutd/	A Texas congressman said he’s running low on shirts due to the partial shutdown of the federal government that took effect Oct. 1, 2013. An Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article on the views of Austin U.S. Reps. Roger Williams, a Republican, and Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, quoted Williams as saying that he favors spending cuts and opposes an increase in the federal debt limit. Williams also indicated he’s not happy about the shutdown. "I didn’t want the government to shut down, I didn’t get my laundry out" of the congressional laundry before it shut down, Williams said. Doggett said he didn’t know there was a congressional laundry. We’re here to serve. Did the federal shutdown also shutter a congressional laundry? By email, spokeswomen for Williams and Doggett each said a dry cleaning store housed in a Capitol office building shut its doors due to the government shutdown. Williams spokeswoman Haley Graves said: "The laundry is just a local laundry/dry cleaning branch that’s located on the Capitol complex and open to the public. It was closed due to the shutdown, so anyone who dropped off suits/shirts/alterations before Oct. 1 aren’t able to get them out at this time." Doggett spokeswoman Kelsey Crow agreed the basement laundry, which we identified as ClassiCleaners in the Longworth House Office Building, closed due to the shutdown. A web search led us to a Feb. 23, 2010, article in American Drycleaner, a trade publication, stating the House had chosen ClassiCleaners "as its new, official ‘green’ drycleaning service provider." Crow also emailed us a photo (posted above) showing what looks like the door to a ClassiCleaners store with two signs, one saying "Closed" and the other stating: "Due to the government shutdown, this facility is closed." We repeatedly telephoned the ClassiCleaners and every time got disconnected. But a search of The Washington Post led us to a Sept. 26, 2013, post on the newspaper’s Federal Eye blog stating that if the federal shutdown occurred, Capitol Hill "service providers" required to close would include stationery stores, "the dry cleaners" and other offices. The article linked to undated web pages overseen by the House Administration Committee including one forecasting the open/closed status of Capitol facilities in the event of a government shutdown. According to the committee, the House "cleaners" would be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 3, 2013, which we took as an indication it otherwise would be closed. According to the committee’s page, the House stationery, gift, beauty and barber shops also were to be closed. Our ruling Williams said a congressional laundry was closed due to the government shutdown. Save for a few hours the first Thursday of October, the House’s official cleaners was closed in connection with the partial government shutdown. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-14108	Says President Obama’s deal "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon."	false	/florida/statements/2016/may/11/carlos-beruff/deal-allows-iran-produce-nuclear-weapon-us-senate-/	Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff lobbed a bombshell against his Democratic opponents and the White House: President Barack Obama’s deal with Iran actually allows that country to build a nuclear weapon. The Manatee County Republican criticized the president’s negotiation skills and berated U.S. Reps. Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy for backing the deal. Grayson and Murphy are squaring off in the Democratic primary, while Beruff faces a packed GOP field. "Both Congressman Grayson and Congressman Murphy supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon," Beruff said in a May 5, 2016, news release. Beruff’s argument gave us pause, since the idea of the Iran nuclear agreement was ostensibly made to prevent the country from building a nuke. When we rechecked the terms of the deal for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb. To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact over the last few months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Opponents (like Beruff) say that all this does is delay a bomb, not prevent it. "The deal legitimatizes Iran’s nuclear program," Beruff campaign spokesman Chris Hartline said in an email. "It allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium and to ramp up enrichment down the road, while also giving the country access to tens of billions of dollars." Hartline further said that reported missile tests in March 2016 (which Iran has denied happening) prove that Iran will undoubtedly cheat on the deal. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s "breakout time" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. "It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. "It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days." Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told PolitiFact last year that the deal definitely impedes Iran’s nuclear program. "Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon," he said. Our ruling Beruff said Obama’s deal "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." He makes it sound as if the agreement formally blesses Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. But it doesn’t. The terms of the deal expressly forbid pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must agree to inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). Either way, that doesn’t sound like an agreement that "allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon." We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea547399-2c45-4d1f-8979-1075a76a36e4	None	Carlos Beruff	None	None	None	2016-05-11T12:39:22	2016-05-05	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
obry-00051	During an Oct. 4 interview with U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the Beloit Daily News brought up minimum wage, an issue Johnson hasn’t spoken about much during the past two years, despite the issue’s appearance in a recent Senate debate.

pomt-02038	New carbon regulations will increase electric bills by "$17 billion every year" and "potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/02/john-boehner/Boehner-says-Obama-climate-change-jobs-bills-costs/	President Barack Obama’s administration unveiled tough new regulations on existing power plants that seek to significantly curb carbon emissions in the coming decades. Moments after the proposal was released, it was widely panned by Republicans, who called it a continuation of Obama’s so-called "War on Coal" and said it would kill jobs, raise electric prices and hurt the economy. On his website, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, put it in more direct terms: "The president’s plan would indeed cause a surge in electricity bills — costs stand to go up $17 billion every year. But it would also shut down plants and potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year." The details of Obama’s plan are extensive — the proposal is 645 pages long. So how did Republicans come up with such exact (and damning) figures so quickly after the proposal was released? The estimates actually come from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that was released in late May. We took a look at it last week, and noted it made several assumptions about the June 2 proposal. We warned that the findings of the study would be relatively unusable if those predictions did not come to light. And that’s what happened. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a goal of reducing carbon emissions 30 percent (based on 2005 levels) by 2030. This is achieved in part by creating carbon caps for each state and providing options for them to reach their targets, including regional "cap and trade" networks, investing in renewable energy and smart grid technology, and eventually phasing out many existing coal plants. But the chamber study that Boehner and other Republicans cite assumed that the Obama administration would want to decrease carbon emissions by 42 percent — not 30 percent — before 2030 (a number Obama first suggested in 2009 during the Copenhagen international climate change talks). When it comes to the pace for reducing CO2 levels, this is a significant difference. This is a point even the chamber made to PolitiFact now that Obama’s regulations have been released. "We were never saying those were the numbers for any scenario other than the ones that we put forward," said Matt Letourneau, spokesman for the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Now that we have a different benchmark, we’re taking a look at the rule and the analysis and the model and we’ll see what we can do (to update the study)." Why don’t the numbers work? By assuming a much more difficult goal, the chamber also predicted that by 2022, the EPA (under a different president) will have to change course to meet the 42 percent threshold. The only means to accomplish this, the chamber concluded, was to force new natural gas plants to use carbon capture and storage technology. In September, the EPA said new natural gas plants would not need to include carbon capture in their facilities. A large chunk of the chamber’s estimated costs of the carbon rules comes from the assumption that new natural gas plants will require carbon capture technology, which they say is 50 percent more expensive to build and also more expensive to operate. Therefore, their assumption that power companies face $478 billion in compliance costs — $339 billion from construction — is likely overblown. Letourneau and Boehner’s office both noted media reports that said the 30 percent threshold could be increased before the final regulations are approved. (Of course, it could also be lowered, too.) There will be a 120-day public comment period before the EPA releases its final draft. There are other criticisms of the chamber study. For example, it did not factor in the cost of no action, which the EPA said is significant. The debate over the cost of these regulations will continue, and we do not dismiss offhand the idea that new regulations on existing power plants have an economic cost. For its part, the EPA says that the new rules will save consumers money on their electric bills and will spur economic growth that will surpass the expense. But even if the regulations do have an economic cost, it’s misleading to quote estimates from a study that wrongly assumed a key piece of the EPA’s proposal. Our ruling Boehner said the EPA’s plan to regulate carbon emissions in existing power plants will increase electric bills by "$17 billion every year" and "potentially put an average of 224,000 more people out of work every year." Those numbers are based on a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study that came out before the EPA announced the regulations on existing power plants. That study wrongly assumed the administration would set a benchmark of reducing carbon emissions by 42 percent before 2030. The regulations released June 2 actually put forward a 30 percent reduction within that timeframe. The chamber itself told PolitiFact its estimates are not based on the goals as announced. But despite these serious flaws, Boehner used the numbers anyway. We rate his statement False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2014-06-02T17:28:42	2014-06-02	['None']
pomt-14474	Says Donald Trump has said "he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/01/conservative-solutions-pac/would-donald-trump-be-neutral-between-israel-and-i/	A political action committee supporting Marco Rubio portrays Donald Trump as not being in the Israel fan club. In a TV ad running in Florida, a screen shot shows a man wearing a bandana featuring what appears to be Arabic letters holding a rocket-propelled grenade. Trump "says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies," says the Conservative Solutions PAC ad. Is that accurate? Trump did make a statement about being "neutral" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, but the ad omits other statements Trump made in support of Israel. Trump’s position on Israel at a town hall and debate The ad cites the MSNBC town hall with Trump in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A spokesman for the super PAC cited Trump’s comments at the town hall and at a subsequent debate.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it. I don't think it helps." About two weeks later at the debate in Houston, Wolf Blitzer asked Trump: "How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?" Trump defended his record by saying that he had been grand marshall of the Israeli Day parade a few years ago and received awards from Israel. But he said when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: "It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' " Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. "With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel." Trump’s additional comments about Israel In December, Trump told the Associated Press that he doubted the commitment of Israelis and Palestinians to the peace process. But he suggested the big lift may have to come from Israel. "A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things," Trump said. "They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal." Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a "huge sticking point" in talks. The same week, when he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump praised Israel by saying that the country has already "given a lot" but doesn’t get credit for it. He explained his strategy if elected: "I don’t like to as a deal maker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room," he said. "I don’t want one side or the other saying ... I think people know where I stand, okay?" He said he would want to enter negotiations with a "clean slate" and the attitude of "everybody is even, we love everybody, let’s see if we can do something." Trump also reminded Jewish Republicans that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. "I am a big fan of Israel," Trump said in the video endorsement. "And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel." During his own campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled the trip after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, "I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders." Trump’s rhetoric is notable on Israel because it is "cooler and more detached" than his GOP rivals, wrote Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Republican and Democratic secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations who now works for the Woodrow Wilson Center. But while Trump has said he can be a better negotiator if he appears neutral, he has made several comments that suggest he has closer ties to Israelis than Palestinians. Trump’s spokespersons did not respond for this fact-check. Our ruling A PAC that supports Rubio says Trump "says he would be neutral between Israel and its enemies." Trump has said that in order to negotiate between Israelis and Palestinians he can’t take sides. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy," he said at a town hall. But the ad omits that Trump has had ties to Israel for years -- he has called himself "pro-Israel" and endorsed Netanyahu’s re-election in 2013. That is a good indication Trump isn’t neutral.

pomt-06139	Says Joe Biden said Jon Corzine is "the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/congressional-republican-group-claims-joe-biden-sa/	President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for their fellow Democrat Jon Corzine as he fought in 2009 for re-election as New Jersey’s governor. They may now be regretting that choice. Corzine, the chairman and CEO of MF Global when it collapsed this fall, has been compelled to testify in front of several Congressional panels about the up to $1.2 billion in client money that disappeared during the firm’s bankruptcy. Using audio from Corzine’s testimony earlier this month and other video clips, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a web ad that ties Corzine, a former senator and governor of New Jersey, to the Obama administration. In the ad posted to YouTube on Dec. 15, Biden says of Corzine, "he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." As Biden makes the comment, a headline in the corner of the video reads: "MF Global Proves Enron-Era Accounting Lives On," linking MF Global to the Texas-based energy company that went bankrupt and became a symbol of corporate fraud. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Biden made the comment during a May 2009 appearance with Corzine in Lodi to tout a project funded by the federal stimulus act, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The ad shows only a short segment of Biden’s speech, but we found two videos on YouTube with Biden’s longer comments -- one of which was posted by an account for Corzine. "Look, the governor just laid out for you the overlap that exists in terms of the things your state is doing and leading on, on energy conservation, on wind and solar, what your state is doing on building schools and investing in education, what your state is doing on health care. And it's not coincidental that that's what the Recovery Act is," Biden said. "It's not coincidental that the things he did here turned out to be the exact same things the Recovery Act has, because way back in the transition period, before we were sworn in, when Barack Obama and I were literally sitting in a desk in a high rise in Chicago beginning to plan how we would try to get this economy out of a ditch. Literally, the first guy I called was Jon Corzine. Not a joke. Not a joke. Because first of all, he's the smartest guy that I know in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." So Biden praised Corzine’s financial prowess then, but is it fair to tie those past comments to what’s happening now? Michele Claibourn, a research associate at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, and Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University who also works as a political media consultant for campaigns, said yes. Claibourn said in an email that "prior praise of Corzine strikes me as relevant insofar as Biden’s/Obama’s praise calls into question the judgment of the administration." Berkovitz said Corzine "had a reputation in terms of being fiscally brilliant and all that and so to say well things have changed now, this is a man who received the accolades of the president, of the vice president and they now should be held accountable for the opinions of the man." "You can’t say, ‘well I’d like to take that back,’" he said. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad that links Corzine to the Obama administration. In it, Biden says, "he’s the smartest guy that I know, in terms of the economy and on finance, I really mean this." Biden made the comment about Corzine before MF Global collapsed and customer funds disappeared, but they’re still the vice president’s words. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04476	"When (Joe Kyrillos) had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/08/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-claims-state-sen-joe-kyrill/	Funding for women’s health care in New Jersey has become a line of attack in the race between U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and his Republican challenger, state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, R-Monmouth. In their first debate Thursday before the general election on Nov. 6, Menendez claimed that Kyrillos has voted six times to oppose women’s health care funding. "When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state," the Democratic senator said near the start of the debate. He repeated the claim in his closing statement: "And not once, not twice, but six times he voted against funding for women’s health care in our state, while I was bringing millions of dollars for those women to get health care." The senator’s claim is on solid ground. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services, which could include breast exams, pregnancy testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. The money could not be used for abortion procedures. Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, responded in a statement: "New Jerseyans know that Joe Kyrillos is a pro-choice Republican who's voted for millions of dollars in women's health initiatives, and that's a fact." Let’s go through those six votes. Since Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, eliminated the money in his budget for fiscal year 2011, the Democrat-led state Legislature has tried unsuccessfully to restore it. As we found in a previous fact-check, that funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning centers across the state. The first set of Kyrillos’ votes occurred on June 28, 2010, when the state Senate considered a bill that would restore the roughly $7.5 million. The Senate cast two sets of votes to pass the bill, and Kyrillos voted no each time. The state Assembly later passed the bill, but Christie vetoed it. On Sept. 20, 2010, the Senate failed to get enough votes to override the veto. Kyrillos voted against the override. On May 23, 2011, the Senate put forward another bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2011, and Kyrillos voted no. That bill passed the Senate, but was not voted on in the Assembly. Soon afterward, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor, but Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes. On July 11, 2011, when the Senate fell short of having enough votes to override that veto, Kyrillos voted against the override. The most recent vote occurred on June 25, 2012, when the Senate passed a bill that would restore the funding for fiscal year 2012. Kyrillos voted no. The Assembly also passed the bill that day, but Christie later vetoed it. Here’s a chart breaking down Kyrillos’ votes against funding for family planning services: Date Legislation Proposed Action Kyrillos Vote June 28, 2010* Senate Bill S-2139 Final passage No June 28, 2010 Senate Bill S-2139 Final passage No Sept. 20, 2010 Senate Bill S-2139 Override veto No May 23, 2011 Senate Bill S-2899 Final passage No July 11, 2011 FY2012 Budget Override veto No June 25, 2012 Senate Bill S-788 Final passage No *Due to an error in the original bill, the Senate voted twice on final passage of the legislation. Our ruling In a debate last week, Menendez said in reference to Kyrillos: "When he had an opportunity to vote for women in terms of their health care, not once, not twice, but six times, he voted against women’s health care in our state." The senator’s claim is on target. Between June 2010 and June 2012, Kyrillos voted six times against providing about $7.5 million for family planning services. We rate the statement True.

pomt-01117	Only 42 percent of young Georgians have a college certificate or degree, but soon 60 percent of jobs will require some college credential.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/07/hank-huckaby/huckaby-target-stats-skills-gap/	State officials are trying to prepare for a time in the near future when it is anticipated that a majority of Georgia jobs will require employees with some college credentials. They’re pushing the state’s technical colleges, colleges and universities to increase the number of degrees and certificates they issue, based largely on two statistics: by 2020, 60 percent of all Georgia jobs will require workers with some college credential; and only 42 percent of young Georgians currently have a college certificate or degree. Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System of Georgia, cited those statistics in a December 16th speech to the Valdosta North Rotary Club. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers saw the resulting news accounts and asked us to delve deeper into the statistics. This is a hot topic given that, a decade ago, the United States was the world’s leader in producing college students with bachelor’s degrees — an indicator, analysts say, of long-term economic strength. Today, the U.S. ranks 12th — in the key age range of 25 to 34 — behind nations such as Russia and South Korea. Georgia has based its response to the looming workforce crisis on two major reports. The first was "Help Wanted," a report published in 2010 by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. The report forecast that more than 60 percent of jobs nationally, 58 percent in Georgia, will require some form of postsecondary education by 2018. The second report, "Time is the Enemy," from Complete College America, from September 2011http://www.completecollege.org/docs/Time_Is_the_Enemy.pdf, also assessed America’s workforce readiness. It found Georgia with a 27 percent skills gap based on forecasts that 61 percent of the state’s jobs in 2020 would require a career certificate or college degree and, at the time, only 34 percent of Georgia adults had an associate degree or higher. North Carolina and Florida were similar to Georgia. North Carolina was listed in the report with a 27 percent skills gap, Florida with a 28 percent skills gap. So where did the 42 percent statistic for Georgia come from? The University System of Georgia and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems worked together in Summer 2011 to try to assess how many credentialed adults were in Georgia. They found that 42.4 percent of Georgians, ages 25 to 34 at the time, had college experience -- 20.9 percent had bachelor’s degrees; 8.2 percent had a graduate or professional degree; 6.7 percent had an associate degree; and 6.6 percent had certificates from college programs that were at least one year, but less than two years. The data is from two "credible authorities," the U.S. Census Bureau and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It is considered "the most reliable available," said Charlie Sutlive, the university system’s spokesman. An update is tentatively set for 2017, which will mark five years since the rollout of the Complete College Georgia initiative at college and university campuses across the state, Sutlive said. In August 2011, Gov. Nathan Deal announced that Georgia was one of 10 states that had been awarded a $1 million grant by the nonprofit Complete College America to significantly increase its college completion rates. The statistics at the time were bleak, given the forecasts for Georgia jobs in the not-too-distant future. Less than 25 percent of full-time students at Georgia’s two-year colleges ever graduate, and only 44 percent of students at the state’s four-year colleges receive their degrees in six years, the governor said. That combination -- unchanged -- would only spell trouble, Deal said. He and others have devised plans to ensure that the state’s colleges, universities and technical are churning out more degrees or certificates. The university system produced about 53,000 degrees a year in 2012, is on target to produce 69,000 degrees a year in 2020 and has a goal of 80,000 a year by 2025, Suitive said. The technical college system has plans for similar year-over-year increases. The University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia have taken several major steps to increase their graduates. For instance, they’ve simplified the enrollment process and now allow credit for 25 courses to transfer between the two systems. Online course offerings also expanded from 1,571 in 2009 to 5,000-plus last fall -- including a new Master’s of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech enrolling 1,256 new students. Our conclusion: Georgia’s workforce is facing a skills gap that the University System of Georgia and Technical College System of Georgia are working together to address by pushing for more graduates. The skills gap is significant, though measures of it have varied albeit slightly. We rate Huckaby's statement as True.	None	Hank Huckaby	None	None	None	2015-01-07T00:00:00	2014-12-16	['None']
pomt-08810	"The unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have."	true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/17/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-unemployment-rate-thos/	Yes, the unemployment rate is still high. But those without a college degree are hurting even more, according to President Barack Obama, who was in Austin last week to raise money for fellow Democrats. "Now, I know some folks argue that as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, my administration should focus solely on economic issues," he said during a side speech at the University of Texas at Austin on Aug. 9. "But as I said the other week to the National Urban League, education is an economic issue. It may be the economic issue of our time. It’s an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who’ve never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have." Almost double? Matt Lehrich, a White House spokesman, pointed us to employment data kept by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking at labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey, the unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent in July 2010, while 10.1 percent of high school graduates who didn't attend college were without jobs. Add those who never graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate creeps up to 11 percent. That's more than double the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degree. Include those who attend attended "some college" or earned an associates degree, and the jobless rate for the college crowd is 6 percent. So, as of July, the unemployment rate for those who never went to college is almost double what it is for those who have. How did the two unemployment rates shake out historically? The data during the last two years show similar ratios. In 2009, on average, about 10.9 percent of those who never attended college were unemployed, while 6.1 percent of those with at least some college were unemployed. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent for those without college, and about 3.1 for those who had. We rate Obama's statement as True.

pomt-09940	"If you actually took the number of Muslims [sic] Americans, we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/04/barack-obama/obama-claims-america-one-largest-muslim-countries/	In the days leading up to his trip to Cairo to give a long-awaited speech before a large Muslim audience, President Barack Obama gave several radio and television interviews, including one in which he claimed that the United States has so many Muslim residents that it would qualify as one of the largest populations in the world. "If you actually took the number of Muslims Americans (sic), we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world," he told French television station Canal Plus. Obama's comment was meant to emphasize the religious diversity of the United States and the importance of understanding between the Western world and followers of Islam, a key point in the speech he gave in Cairo on June 4, 2009. "What I want to do is to create a better dialogue so that the Muslim world understands more effectively how the United States but also how the West thinks about many of these difficult issues like terrorism, like democracy," he told Canal Plus. "Now, the flip side is I think that the United States and the West generally, we have to educate ourselves more effectively on Islam." Some PolitiFact readers heard Obama's claim and asked us to check it. We should note that estimates of the number of Muslims living in America varies greatly. For example, the Islamic Information Center, a group that educates people in the United States about Islam, says there are upwards of 8 million. And NationMaster.com, a Web site that allows users to compare different countries based on demographics, pegs the number at 6 million. We are using numbers from the CIA Online World Factbook, a highly regarded government source for global statistics. It's updated twice a month, and we're relying on the latest version. By the World Factbook's count, Muslims in the United States make up about 0.6 percent of the population. That's around 1.8 million. Using the CIA's data, we made a list of the 60 countries with the most Muslim residents. Coming in first is Indonesia, More than 240 million people live there, and 86.1 percent of the population identifies as Muslim. That means that about 206 million Indonesians are of the Islamic faith. No. 2 on the list is Pakistan, where 95 percent of the roughly 176 million people identify as Muslim. That means about 167 million residents are of the Islamic faith. India, Bangladesh and Turkey come in next at 156 million, 129 million and 76 million, respectively. Moving down the list, Morocco takes 10th place with 34 million Muslim residents, and Syria comes in at number 20, with about 18 million Muslims. The No. 60 slot goes to Serbia, home to 236,138 Muslims. According to our calculations, you have to scroll down to the very bottom to see where the United States fits in amid all these statistics. Again, the CIA Factbook says that less than 1 percent — 0.6 percent to be precise — of the 307 million residents identify as Muslim. That means the United States has only 1.8 million Muslims. So, of the 60 most populous Muslim states, the United States ranks 58th. If we rely instead on NationMaster.com, which pegs the Muslim population at 6 million, the United States is 37th out of 60. And if we go with 8 million, as the Islamic Information Center estimates, the United States comes in at 29 on the list. The exact number of how many Muslims are living in the United States is fuzzy at best. But one thing is for certain: No matter who you slice it, America ranks low, whether it's 1.8 million or 8 million. So Obama is trying to make a point that the United States is in touch with the Muslim world because it has a substantial Muslim population. But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60. As a result, we give Obama a Pants on Fire.

pomt-07143	Says George LeMieux "even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/15/adam-hasner/hasner-says-lemieux-compared-rubio-obama/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner is attacking GOP opponent George LeMieux by invoking two names likely to displease conservative primary voters. Barack Obama and Charlie Crist. In an Internet ad released June 10, 2011, Hasner tries to link LeMieux to Crist -- the former governor who left the GOP while trying to win a Senate seat in 2010. Marco Rubio, a former House speaker who served as a state legislator from 2000 to 2008 and is now a national Republican star, won that seat. The ad shows a photo of Crist and then states: Defended President Obama's Stimulus As "Helpful to Florida" Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar Architect Of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama Charlie Crist -- Right? Wrong. As the word "wrong" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- "Get to know the Real George LeMieux." The goal of the message is clear enough: Paint a portrait of LeMieux -- Crist's former chief of staff who was later appointed by Crist to serve in the U.S. Senate -- as an Obama-loving Crist buddy who criticized Florida's GOP superstar, Rubio. But is it accurate? For this Truth-O-Meter item we will examine the claim Hasner made that LeMieux "even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama." In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we're checking another claim that LeMieux "falsely attacked Marco Rubio." Hasner's ad cited a Nov. 17, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article as the source for LeMieux comparing Rubio to Obama. Back then, LeMieux was supporting Crist over Rubio. And back then, Crist was still running as a Republican. LeMieux critiqued Rubio in an item posted to the Times' online blog, The Buzz. From The Buzz: "Being governor means you have to make choices. And you have to make decisions," LeMieux said, heading into a GOP lunch at the U.S. Capitol. "It's very easy to be a critic and the speaker now is not in office. He wasn't there when the state was facing the challenges of the huge recession and the stimulus. He didn't have to vote on that. All of the folks that were in his administration voted for the stimulus money. And I suspect if he were there, he could vote for it. This is just like President Obama being able to be against the war in Iraq because he didn't have to vote on it. There's a lot of parallels to draw between Speaker Rubio and President Obama in the way they are running their race and in their ability to throw bombs without ever having to lead because they are out of office." LeMieux was arguing that it was easy for Rubio, who left the Legislature in 2008, to criticize Crist for taking stimulus money when Rubio was no longer in the Legislature -- just like it was easy for Obama to oppose going to war against Iraq because he wasn't in the U.S. Senate or White House then. (Obama was in the Illinois Legislature when Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched in 2003.) LeMieux isn't comparing Rubio and Obama on a stance or an issue here (like they both supported cap-and-trade, or something like that). He is making a general point that it's easy for candidates to later oppose something they didn't have to vote on. None of that is made clear in the ad. But that's not the only problem when considering this claim. "George endorsed Marco the day after Charlie left the Republican Party and aggressively campaigned for Marco in the General Election," LeMieux campaign manager Brian Seitchik e-mailed us June 13. LeMieux hosted a fundraiser for Rubio, campaigned with him and introduced him at events, Seitchik wrote. (Note: Crist left the GOP on April 29. The next day LeMieux issued this statement: "I am saddened that my friend, Governor Crist, has decided to leave the Republican Party. Our friendship runs deep, but my commitment to the principles of the Republican Party runs deeper. I cannot walk down the path he has chosen. ... I will support our Republican nominee and will continue to do everything I can both in Florida and across the country to increase the number of Republicans in the United States Senate." A formal endorsement of Rubio didn't come until July, however, according to The Hill which cited the conservative blog, The Shark Tank.) There are other examples of LeMieux supporting Rubio. On July 12, 2010, The Buzz reported that LeMieux's PAC gave $2,400 to Rubio's campaign. The conservative blog the Shark Tank reported on the same day that LeMieux endorsed Rubio -- see a video of LeMieux here calling Rubio a "good conservative candidate." And LeMieux campaigned for Rubio at a few Central Florida stops -- including The Villages retirement community -- the Palm Beach Post reported Oct 7. At one of events, LeMieux called Rubio '"the brightest star of our generation in politics — and not just in Florida, nationwide,'" the Post wrote. Lastly, we have to point out that simply comparing Rubio, a Republican, to Obama, a Democrat, doesn't have to be a bad thing. The New Republic, for instance, called Rubio the "Republican Obama" in a February 2010 article. And a national conservative figure, Richard Land, was quoted in 2010 talking up a Rubio run for president in 2012, noting that Rubio would have "more experience than Obama had" when Obama ran for president. (PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Barely True.) On the whole, this claim is puzzling. Let's again look at the text of the ad, which starts by linking LeMieux to three issues -- the federal stimulus package, Big Sugar and cap and trade. Then the ad abruptly switches to general statements about Rubio saying that LeMieux falsely attacked Rubio and "compared Rubio to Barack Obama." LeMieux didn't compare Rubio and Obama on an issue such as those listed at the start of the ad -- he said they both used a familiar campaign tactic, throwing "bombs" about something they didn't have to vote on themselves. The ad provides no explanation for how he compared the two politicians and neglects to note that LeMieux supported Rubio's campaign once Crist left the GOP. We rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07473	"Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/15/peter-defazio/peter-defazio-says-medicare-passed-virtually-no-re/	During a House floor speech on April 13, 2011, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., took aim at a recent proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to change the way the Medicare system works. As part of a plan for reducing the national debt, Ryan proposes that Americans 55 and younger today would not get traditional Medicare but rather qualify for a government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (We recently fact-checked a characterization of the plan by one of Ryan’s fellow Republicans, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana; see it here.) DeFazio, in his floor speech, decried Ryan’s plan, arguing that it would all but gut a popular program that works well. "Before Medicare, 25 percent of the seniors in America lived in poverty, many driven there by the lack of affordable, decent health insurance," DeFazio said. "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support. It solved that problem. Seniors today are guaranteed quality, affordable health care. They pay about 27 percent of the cost. While under the guise of fiscal responsibility, the Republican budget wants to turn back the clock to the good old days: Throw the seniors into the private health care market again." We wondered whether DeFazio was right that "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support." In 2009, we rated a similar statement by former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, and we will draw from it as we analyze DeFazio’s more recent statement. It turns out that a significant number of Republicans did vote in favor of the Medicare bill when Congress took it up in 1965. The House adopted a conference report -- a unified House-Senate version of the bill -- on July 27, 1965, and passed it by a 307-116 margin. That included 70 Republican "yes" votes, against 68 "no" votes. Then, on July 28, 1965, the Senate adopted the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor and 17 against. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it two days later. So in the House, a slight majority of the Republican caucus voted for Medicare, and in the Senate, a significant minority voted in favor. Both of these strike us as more than "virtually no Republican support." It’s true that the Medicare bill was unpopular in certain segments of the Republican Party. In 1961, Ronald Reagan, the future president, famously released an LP with a speech in which he demonized "socialized medicine," citing proposals that sound a lot like the one passed four years later. "Write those letters now; call your friends and then tell them to write them," Reagan said. "If you don't, this program, I promise you, will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow, and behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. ... And if you don't do this and if I don't do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free." Other high-profile Republicans who opposed Medicare included Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater -- the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 1964 -- and future president George H.W. Bush. And as the Medicare bill progressed through the House, Republican support was scant. No Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8. And all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill. As the bill worked its way through the Senate, Republican support was somewhat stronger. In the final Finance Committee vote, the measure passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. "The political parties were very different in 1965 than they are today," said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the U.S. Senate. "Both had strong conservative and liberal wings, so most votes were bipartisan because the conservatives in the two parties voted against the liberals in each party. You had Republicans like Jacob Javits (N.Y.) who were more liberal than most Democrats, and Democrats like James Eastland (Miss.) who were more conservative than most Republicans. So there were Republicans who supported Medicare and Democrats who opposed it." When we contacted DeFazio’s office, a spokeswoman noted that the congressman has a background in gerontology and offered links to articles, including this one, to show that Republicans "fought against the creation of Medicare starting with the Truman administration." It’s true that some of the biggest opponents of Medicare early on were Republicans. But many big opponents were conservative Democrats, and ultimately, it’s wrong to say, as DeFazio does, that "Medicare passed with virtually no Republican support." His comment focuses on the period when the bill finally passed, and thanks to the GOP’s liberal-to-moderate wing -- which by now has largely disappeared -- a majority of House Republicans and a sizable minority of Senate Republicans voted in favor of Medicare. We rate DeFazio’s statement False.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2011-04-15T11:31:13	2011-04-13	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09519	Among the money spent on health care in the United States, "46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/16/joe-biden/biden-overstates-role-medicare-medicaid-us-health-/	In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Feb. 14, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden made the case for restraining costs through the administration's approach to health care reform and discussed the scope of federal spending on health care. "I think the president made the right judgment in deciding that in order to bend the cost curve and prevent people from being victimized by health insurance costs that we had to move and we had to move aggressively," Biden said. "And the president is still committed to making sure that we do three things: One, make sure that those whose premiums are now continuing to skyrocket in fact are brought under control; making sure that the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid, that we bend that cost curve to gain control of the future, of our future fiscal situation; and making sure the insurance companies can't engage in the kind of practices they do with pre-existing conditions and limits on coverage, etc." The 46-cents-on-the-dollar figure sounded high to us, so we decided to check. We looked at the Congressional Budget Office's June 2009, report, "The Long-Term Budget Outlook." The report says that in 2007, 54 percent of the $2.1 trillion spent on health care in the United States was financed privately. That leaves 46 percent (or, as Biden put it, 46 cents on the dollar) financed by public sources. So Biden used the right statistic -- but he was less than careful in his description of what the statistic described. According to the CBO report, federal spending on Medicare made up 21 percent of total U.S. health care expenditures in 2007, and the combined federal and state spending on Medicaid represented 16 percent. Given that the federal government on average pays 57 percent of the cost for Medicaid (the federal share varies state by state), the federal portion of spending on Medicaid actually represents 9 percent of U.S. health care expenditures. So when Biden specifically said that "the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid," he overstated the federal percentage for the two programs. It's actually 30 cents of every dollar, rather than 46 cents. So what accounts for the 16 percentage-point difference? The answer is federal money spent on health care programs other than Medicare and Medicaid (including veterans' health care, military health care and the State Children's Health Insurance Program) and funds spent on health care by state and local governments. "What he really should have said was that 46 percent comes from public spending, rather than saying 46 percent comes from Medicare and Medicaid," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. A spokesman for Biden conceded that the vice president should have been clearer. "The vice president's list of federal programs should have been longer than Medicare and Medicaid -- he cited only these two largest programs in the interest of time," said Jay Carney, Biden's communications director. "He should have said 'such as' or 'including.' " As a sidelight, Brookings Institution health care scholar Henry Aaron points out that even the 54 percent of health care dollars that are privately financed are indirectly supported by the federal government, through such policies as tax exclusions for employer-provided health care. The value of these supports is estimated to run into the billions of dollars. But that isn't what Biden was talking about. Essentially, the vice president cited an accurate number, but he failed to describe correctly what it meant, and he ended up making the share of federal Medicare and Medicaid spending seem half again as big as it actually is. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-02-16T13:38:01	2010-02-14	['United_States', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10540	"We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/barack-obama/up-yes-but-maybe-not-skyrocketing/	In the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 22, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama, pleaded for more civility in the immigration debate, because it is encouraging hate crimes against Hispanics. "Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly," Obama said. "Oftentimes it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate, as it's been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable." Indeed, the South Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, reached that same conclusion in an Intelligence Report in late 2007. The report, titled "Immigration Backlash" cited FBI statistics that showed a 35 percent increase in hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006. Hateful and false propaganda, once limited to white supremacy groups and border state extremists, has made its way into the mouths of political pundits, radio talk show hosts and even some politicians, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Report for the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the report: "While their dehumanizing rhetoric typically stops short of openly sanctioning bloodshed, much of it implicitly encourages or even endorses violence by characterizing immigrants from Mexico and Central America as 'invaders,' 'criminal aliens' and 'cockroaches.'" The findings and conclusions of that study are echoed by a report from the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S. That report also cited FBI statistics for hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006. According to the FBI numbers, the number of anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose from 426 in 2003 to 576 in 2006, the year the immigration issues came to the forefront of the national debate. But are the numbers reliable and significant enough to suggest a trend? Potok allows that the statistics have limitations. For one, the numbers are relatively small. Potok notes, however, that National Crime Victimization surveys suggest the hate crimes in the annual crime report are about 20 to 30 times lower than the actual number of hate crimes actually committed, but which go largely unreported. He also argues that while the numbers are small, the large percentage change between the years represents a significant trend. It should be noted, however, that if one tracks the FBI's hate crime statistics prior to 2003, the trend of rising violence due to heated rhetoric becomes less clear. For example, the FBI reports 597 anti-Hispanic hate crimes in 2001 and 557 in 2000 - about the same as the 2006 numbers. Regardless of the numbers, many Hispanic organization leaders like Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, say Obama is dead-on based on what they are hearing from members. In a 2006 national survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, more than half (54%) said they believe the debate has increased discrimination. "Within the community, there is an overwhelming feeling that this is an unmistakable trend," said Cecilia Munoz, senior vice president of policy for the National Council of La Raza. Before the immigration issue blew up in 2006, her organization would occasionally get hate mail. Now, she said, they get hate mail every day, some of them with threats. At their annual conference, they now provide security training to members of Hispanic advocacy groups. "For the first time, our affiliates are getting hate mail and threats," she said. "There's just no doubt that what Sen. Obama said reflects what people are feeling in the community." Obama's campaign did not respond to Politifact's request to explain where he got his numbers. As noted, when you look at the historical trend over the last 10 years, the numbers roller-coaster, so it's hard to say, based on those numbers, whether anti-Hispanic hate crimes have actually spiked due to the immigration debate. It's also true that the relatively small number of reported incidents makes even a few additional ones look like a dramatic increase, in terms of percentage. But the numbers steadily rose from 2003 to 2006 and Obama's comment fairly and accurately reflects two reports that reached that conclusion. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-07660	On the night of the Wisconsin state Senate vote on the budget package, "a mob showed up and busted down the door and took over the Capitol."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/11/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/	After weeks of protests and political maneuvering, the stalemate on Wisconsin’s controversial budget-repair bill ended in lightning fashion the evening of March 9, 2011, after a surprise move by Republicans. The Senate, which had been blocked from acting because of the absence of 14 Democrats who fled to Illinois, approved the bill -- which curtails collective bargaining rights for most public employees and requires them to pay more for health care and pensions -- in a matter of minutes. In those same minutes, the Capitol went from relative calm to chaos. The following morning, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, described the scene in an interview with talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620). He told of Capitol staffers seeing a crowd moving down State Street from the direction of the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus to the Capitol and shouts and anger from opponents who already were inside. Other reports told of how in the two hours leading up the vote -- the amount of time for which notice of a Senate-Assembly conference committee meeting had been given -- Twitter and Facebook alerts went out urging union members and other bill opponents to high-tail it to the Capitol. The daily protests that had wound down a week earlier resumed with a new fury, more urgent and angry. Indeed, soon after the vote Republican senators received an e-mailed death threat that is under investigation. Fitzgerald described the scene after the vote this way in his conversation with Sykes: "Suddenly, a mob showed up and busted down the door and took over the Capitol." Let’s stop for a minute. To be sure, the scene was chaotic. And there are many reports, some of them contradictory, on specific things that happened. In the wake of the vote and the reaction by protesters, the rhetoric on both sides was heated and, often, over the top. In this item, we will look at Fitzgerald’s statement, which was one of the clearest assertions on what happened. First, a little more background: The move to vote on the bill surprised many, since there had been indications during the week of talks between Democratic and Republican lawmakers and Gov. Scott Walker. The conference committee -- which included members of both parties and from both chambers -- met on two hours’ notice, to pave the way for final passage. Democrats argue the meeting violated the state open meetings law, which generally requires 24-hour notice of meetings, or two hours under emergency circumstances. Republicans say the meeting did not violate the law, since the Legislature is in special session and in those cases no advance notice is required. The courts may ultimately decide who is right. At the meeting, the committee cleared the way for quick action by dropping some parts of the bill -- the pieces that required a minimum of 20 members to be present. But the committee left intact the key pieces: Walker’s push to have public employees pay more for health care and pensions and to curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees. The committee met for mere minutes, with Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, complaining loudly he did not even have time to read the new language. The vote took place just after 6 p.m. -- after the building would normally be closed. But because the Senate was in session, the building was kept open. One entrance was open while the other two were locked, according to the Department of Administration. Some members of the public were present. They shouted their disapproval when the conference committee sent the matter to the Senate, which met literally minutes later -- without the still-absent Democrats -- and quickly voted to approve the bill. The bill was then sent to the Assembly, which was already scheduled to take it up the following morning. A crowd began to gather during and after the unexpected action by the Senate, fueled no doubt by media reports and the urgent Twitter and Facebook messages. Protesters arrived and some tried to muscle their way into the building. After the vote, police tried to close the building but faced a growing crowd. WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) showed law officers trying to keep a door closed, before being overwhelmed by protesters who streamed past them. Other footage showed people climbing into the Capitol through open windows. The police backed off. Soon the rotunda was, once again, filled with thousands of people. Hundreds stayed overnight. By morning, many had gathered outside the Assembly chamber. Some blocked access to office hallways and had to be physically removed by authorities. The building was declared to be on lockdown. The start of the Assembly session was delayed for hours due to problems providing clear, safe access to the building. (The bill ultimately passed on March 10, 2011, was signed into law the next day.) Now, let’s return to Fitzgerald’s statement, which has three clear assertions, the first of which was labeling the crowd a "mob." Here are a few dictionary definitions: Mob: A large disorderly crowd or throng. Mob: A disorderly or riotous crowd of people. Mob: A disorderly crowd of people. Was the crowd large? Yes? Disorderly? Yes, in that they refused to follow the orders of police officers and pushed past them. Were they riotous? There were no reported injuries or arrests. But that portion of Fitzgerald’s statement seems to fit the situation. Next, Fitzgerald said the crowd "busted down the door." They did not do so in the literal sense of knocking a door down. But they clearly overwhelmed police, who had tried to secure the doors and ultimately gave up. The Journal Sentinel had three reporters and two photographers at the Capitol that night. Their report said: "Protesters poured into the Capitol after police stopped guarding at least one entrance and outside doors were opened." Walk-throughs of the building early the next morning by reporters did not show signs of significant damage. The Department of Administration later provided its own damage summary: Wooden panels were kicked in on two exterior doors; seven windows had security hardware damaged or removed; hinge pins were removed on a pair of exterior doors and the bolting mechanism was broken on a service entrance. So, the crowd forced its way into the building and did some -- though not widespread -- damage. Finally, Fitzgerald’s statement said the crowd "took over the Capitol." Reports made it clear the protesters did not leave when they were asked to and there were enough problems that the building could not function as it normally would the following day. Staffers -- and lawmakers -- were initially unable to enter. The Assembly session was delayed for hours. Some media reports labeled the situation a "takeover," but that suggests more than occupying the building, which protesters did. It suggests controlling the building, which is not supported by the accounts we have heard. So where does this leave us? Fitzgerald’s declared a mob busted its way into the Capitol and took over the building. Yes, a large, angry crowd formed and some forced their way past police officers who fell back rather than try to prevent more from entering. The crowd did not literally bust down doors, but some damage was caused to the building. While they defied orders and delayed action the following day, they never controlled the situation. So, the thrust of Fitzgerald’s statement is correct, but the rhetoric overstates some of what actually happened. Indeed, some of the fallout was a result not just of the policy changes in the bill -- which have prompted weeks of protests -- but the procedure in how it was brought up for a vote. The short notice helped fuel the response and may have left authorities unprepared for it. The definition for Half True is "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." That’s our rating.

pomt-13870	"The steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just (that) it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-wrong-about-size-us-steel-production-/	When Donald Trump made a high-profile speech outlining his approach to trade, he did it in Monessen, Pa., a town near Pittsburgh where a big steel mill has been shuttered for the past three decades. A day after Trump’s speech, Barack Obama brought up the history of American steel during a joint appearance with the Canadian prime minister and the Mexican president, who were meeting for a summit in Ottawa. Reporters asked the three leaders what they would do to counter the anti-free-trade sentiment exemplified by Trump. Obama acknowledged the shortcomings of trade agreements, but he argued that reverting to tariffs and a possible trade war was the wrong way to improve the situation. He pointed to technological change as an irreversible factor. "This nostalgia about an era when everybody was working in manufacturing jobs, and you didn’t need a college degree, and you could go in and as long as you worked hard you could support a family and live a middle-class life -- that has been undermined far more by automation than it has been by outsourcing or the shift of jobs to ... low-wage countries," Obama said. "I mean, the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just (that) it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." Several readers asked us to look into Obama’s comparison -- that "the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." It turns out that Obama was wrong on both counts. Steel production Frank Giarratani, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in the steel industry, provided us with numbers calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey for raw steel production. The data goes back to 1900. The high point came in 1973, when the United States produced 137 million metric tons of raw steel. By 2013, the most recent year available, that had fallen to 87 million metric tons -- a decline of more than one-third from 1973. That’s not even close to "as much" as the peak, which is what Obama said. "We do produce a lot of steel, but current production is far below the post-WWII peak," Giarratani said. Raw steel production is also down a bit since 2008, when the figure was 92 million metric tons. That was the last year before Obama took office and, perhaps more important, the last year before the Great Recession really hit. Production plunged in 2009, before eventually rebounding. Other current economic trends have also had an impact. For instance, the ongoing decline in oil and gas drilling due to low prices is driving companies to cut back on tubing orders, contributing to a slowdown in steel production, said Jeff Manuel, an associate professor of historical studies at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. "I live near U.S. Steel’s Granite City Works in Granite City, Ill.," Manuel said. "This mill is currently shut down due, as I understand it, largely to slack demand from oil and gas companies in the Gulf Coast region." Steel industry employment Tracking employment is a little trickier than tracking production, but several experts said that the one-tenth figure Obama cited is off base. Data from the American Iron and Steel Institute pegged the all-time employment high at 650,000 employees in 1953. More recent data from the institute, for 2015, shows that the steel industry directly employs about 142,000 people in the United States. That’s closer to one in five jobs left, not the one in 10 Obama cited. "So one-tenth is an exaggeration," said Benjamin H. Liebman, an economist at Saint Joseph's University who specializes in international trade. The automation trend Obama mentioned did contribute to the downsizing. "The major reason that steel employment has fallen drastically over the last 40 years is improved technology," Liebman said. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, "labor productivity has seen a fivefold increase since the early 1980s, going from an average of 10.1 man-hours per finished ton to an average of 1.9 man-hours per finished ton of steel in 2014." American steel production has increasingly shifted away from the extraction of ore for raw material and towards the recycling of scrap metal, which typically requires fewer workers. "Now, more than 50 percent of all steel produced in the United States is from a process that recycles scrap metal," Giarratani said. The White House acknowledged that Obama’s remark was incorrect, and instead told PolitiFact that "the U.S. is producing considerably more steel than when the president took office." However, the statistics the White House used to back up that assertion were based on 2009 data, which captured the post-recession low point. Our ruling Obama said that "the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to." In reality, production is down by more than one-third from its historical peak in 1973, and the employment picture -- while still severely shrunken -- is down to about one-fifth of its 1950s level, rather than one-tenth.

pomt-10322	"Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square here. And the family legend is that he is a distant cousin of mine."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/30/barack-obama/just-call-him-wild-barack-obama/	In a packed town hall in Springfield, Mo., Sen. Barack Obama laid down the challenge for a duel. His eyes weren't exactly squinting. And theme music to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly could not be heard. But the gauntlet was dropped. "I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes," Obama said. "Right here. Right now." Then Obama surprised the crowd. "I don't know if people are aware of the fact," Obama said, "but the family legend is that Wild Bill Hickok, he's a distant cousin of mine." The crowd roared with laughter. It seemed that perhaps the sun had gotten to him. "I'm serious, I'm serious," Obama said. "I don't know if it's true, but that's the family legend. But we're going to research that." No need, Sen. Obama. We called the New England Historic Genealogical Society. These are the folks who back in March released the study that found that Obama is a distant relative of actor Brad Pitt (ninth cousins, to be exact). Chris Child, a staff genealogist, compared geneological charts for Obama and Hickok and...bang...there it was. The two trees intersected with one Thomas Blossom of Holland, who arrived in Plymouth, Mass., in 1629. The two are sixth cousins six times removed, Child said. Whatever that means. Seems quite a length for Obama to go to support a metaphor about dueling with your opponent over taxes, but then Hickok was also a noted gambler. Obama also said that Hickok, the legendary frontier lawman, had his first duel in Springfield, Mo. While we were digging we looked that up, too. And Obama is right again. While it's hard for many historians to separate fact from legend, it is documented that James Butler Hickok (his name wasn't even William) got the better of former Confederate Army soldier Davis Tutt in a 1865 "quick draw" duel after a dispute involving gambling debts and, you guessed it, a woman. In the ensuing years, Hickok boasted of killing more than 100 men. Though in his defense, he said they all had it coming. Hickok got his in 1876 after he apparently broke the cardinal rule of gunfighters: He sat with his back to the door and was shot from behind while playing poker at a saloon in Deadwood, S.D. The story was that he was holding two pairs, aces and eights — hence the term "dead man's hand" still used today. The relation to "Wild Bill" Hickok is way cooler than the revelations earlier this year that Obama is distantly related to none other than vice president Dick Cheney. Undoubtedly, Obama took a lot of ribbing over that. Maybe those jokesters ought to sleep with one eye open because Obama's "family legend" is correct. We rule the statement True.

pomt-03842	Says president is ‘spending $2.2 billion to give away "ObamaPhones." ’	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/15/steve-stockman/steve-stockman-says-president-spending-22-billion-/	Before the so-called sequestration budget cuts began taking effect March 1, 2013, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman had some alternative suggestions for the president. On Feb. 22, he tweeted about one program he has suggested trimming: "Obama claims a small cut to federal means losing local police and firefighters, but he's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " As far back as 2009, PolitiFact has checked claims about President Barack Obama handing out free cell phones. We decided to see how this statement compared. The government initiative that helps low-income citizens pay for telephone service is the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program. FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield told us by email that Lifeline began in 1985 because of concerns that local rates would rise after a government lawsuit broke up AT&T’s monopoly of the U.S. phone market. Lifeline was enshrined in law in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Wigfield said, then in 2005 and 2008 began to allow "resellers" of cell service -- companies that did not own their own networks -- to participate. Today, he said, "about 75 percent of Lifeline support goes for wireless service." The program does not provide phones or phone service and is not paid for by taxes, Wigfield said. Rather, it pays $9.25 a month to a user’s phone company. Some companies give out free phones and price their plans at $9.25 a month, making the plans essentially "free," he said. Money for Lifeline comes out of the Universal Service Fund; phone companies pay into the fund and then pass the cost on to customers via a fee on their phone bills. (Click here to read more detailed explanations in this story’s excerpted emails.) Eligible Lifeline participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs. In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans. The term "Obama phones" has been attached to Lifeline since at least late 2009, when PolitiFact rated as Mostly False a chain email claim that Obama was giving away free phones. More famously, a viral video during the 2012 presidential campaign showed an Obama supporter saying "Everybody in Cleveland -- low (income), minority -- got Obama phones." Soon after, PolitiFact gave a Florida state official a Pants on Fire rating for saying the Obama campaign was giving out phones. Both of those PolitiFact ratings cited the fact that the program existed years before Obama took office, so implying he created the program was incorrect. Stockman’s tweet similarly linked the program to Obama but added a financial factor: "He's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " Stockman spokesman Donny Ferguson emailed us a Feb. 12, 2013, Wall Street Journal news story that said, "The U.S. government spent about $2.2 billion last year to provide phones to low-income Americans ... Payouts under the program have shot up from $819 million in 2008, as more wireless carriers have persuaded regulators to let them offer the service." Wigfield sent us the FCC’s total spending figures for Lifeline in recent years: 2007: $823 million 2008: $821 million 2009: $1 billion 2010: $1.13 billion 2011: $1.78 billion 2012: $2.1 billion The post-2008 boom, he said, came after the FCC decided to open Lifeline to phone companies offering low-cost cell plans on networks they did not own. Tracfone was the first such provider to become an eligible carrier for Lifeline, he said. The Journal article said Tracfone has since become the country’s fifth-largest wireless carrier and that other companies have expanded as "Lifeline users have been a source of subscriber growth in the otherwise saturated U.S. market." Our ruling Stockman said Obama’s "spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ " That figure’s about right for 2012 federal spending on the Lifeline program, but as PolitiFact has noted before, attributing it to Obama is incorrect. It’s important to note, too, that the money comes from phone fees, so it wouldn’t be possible to prevent public safety cuts by halting the phone program. The tradeoff Stockman asserts isn’t valid. We rate his statement as Mostly False.	None	Steve Stockman	None	None	None	2013-03-15T14:56:10	2013-02-22	['None']
pomt-01363	Some doctors say Ebola can be transmitted through the air by "a sneeze or some cough."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/19/george-will/george-will-claims-sneeze-cough-spread-ebola/	As the national effort ramps up to beat back Ebola, the Obama administration has been taking heat. Critics say the president and top public health officials painted too rosy a picture of the country’s state of readiness. As proof, they point to the infection of two Dallas health care workers who treated the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Conservative pundit George Will attacked what to him was the hubris in those early statements. "The problem is the original assumption, said with great certitude if not certainty, was that you need to have direct contact, meaning with bodily fluids from someone because it’s (Ebola) not airborne," Will said Oct. 19 on Fox News Sunday. "There are doctors who are saying that in a sneeze or some cough, some of the airborne particles can be infectious." Will also said Ebola could survive on a dry surface "for a number of days." Show host Chris Wallace cut Will off, asserting that Ebola does not spread like the flu, which does move from person to person when someone with the illness is out in public. When another guest challenged Will to cite his source, he ultimately referred to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Here, we’re fact-checking Will’s claim that scientists say a cough or sneeze can spread Ebola. From the context of the discussion, we understand that Will was talking about the risk to the general public. We reached out to Will and did not hear back but thanks to the rumor website Snopes, we have a pretty good idea where he got his information. In mid September, the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy posted a commentary from two University of Illinois professors. The commentary, co-written by Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, argued that health care workers treating patients with Ebola should wear respirators. Face masks, they said, are not enough. We asked Brosseau if Will had correctly relayed her work. Brosseau said her views had nothing to do with Ebola spreading among the public at large. The focus was on health care workers treating people in the isolation wards. "We were concerned about aerosols generated by infected patients in the most severe stage of the disease," Brosseau said. Will had mistakenly connected the pathway of infection in a hospital room with someone coughing or sneezing in public. As has been well documented, the first symptom of infection is a fever. As the virus multiplies in the body, vomiting and diarrhea set in. Brosseau had written that it is possible that for patients in that condition, tiny water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could get into the air and be inhaled. In a laboratory experiment, monkeys with hoods over their heads could acquire the Ebola virus, but Brosseau said that lab experiments should be put in context. "We are not aware of any published data about the viability or infectiousness of the Ebola organism in aerosols in the real world," Brosseau told PunditFact. "It appears unlikely that the public will be exposed to infectious aerosols because they are not likely to encounter infected people experiencing the severe symptoms." We found similar views in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases, and summaries issued by the Centers for Disease Control , the World Health Organization and the New England Journal of Medicine. Adam Lauring, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Michigan, emphasized that Ebola is not a respiratory disease. Coughing and sneezing are not symptoms in the way that they are with the flu. Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, said if someone with Ebola sneezed or coughed into your face when you were close to them, that could transmit the virus through droplets. But, "It’s important to note that this form of transmission does not constitute 'airborne,' " Gire said. "This is still a form of direct contact." "If you were on a plane, and someone sneezed, you wouldn’t be at risk of getting infected unless you were sneezed on directly within close quarters, and that cough or sneeze transferred droplets into mucosal membranes. This is very unlikely scenario, but not out of the realm of possibility. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been sneezed on directly, and only one of those times was by someone I didn’t know." One of the problems with the public debate over Ebola, Lauring said, is that science can’t prove that something will never happen. On the other hand, he also said we ought to look at what has happened. "If airborne transmission was an imminent concern, one would have to ask why no one in the United States has been infected except for two people who had close contact with the patient," Lauring said. "Importantly, none of the people who were living with the patient prior to his second trip to thee Texas hospital have been infected." While we are not fact-checking Will’s statement about infectious particles remaining alive for several days on a dry surface, Lauring said he knows of no evidence of that. Gire said it's theoretically possible under the right conditions, though it's highly unlikely. Our ruling Will said that some scientists say that Ebola can be transmitted in public by a sneeze or a cough. The source of that was a commentary about the risks to hospital workers treating people in advanced stages of the disease. One of the authors of that commentary said her work applied only to health care workers in those settings. The medical literature says sneezing and coughing are not part of the disease’s typical symptoms, and experts we reached drew a bright line between what might happen in a hospital isolation ward and a person with early symptoms of Ebola before he or she is admitted. There is no evidence that Ebola has been transmitted in the general public through coughing or sneezing. Will took a medical commentary out of context. We rate the claim False. Update (Noon, Oct. 20): After we published this item, we heard from some folks who disagreed with our ruling. Read our response here.

pomt-02486	The words "subhuman mongrel," which Ted Nugent called President Barack Obama, were used by the Nazis to "justify the genocide of the Jewish community."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/18/wolf-blitzer/wolf-blitzer-ted-nugent-used-nazi-terminology-subh/	Ted Nugent may have made his name as a rock musician, but today he increasingly is known for his controversial comments about President Barack Obama. At a January gun expo in Las Vegas, Nugent described Obama as "a communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured, subhuman mongrel." Nugent now is campaigning with Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott. This led CNN’s Wolf Blitzer to question whether the Abbott campaign understands the history of such language. (Abbott has not distanced himself from Nugent.) "That’s what the Nazis called Jews to justify the genocide of the Jewish community," Blitzer said in a Feb. 18, 2014, interview. "They called them untermenschen, subhuman mongrels. If you read some of the literature that the Nazis put out there, there is a long history of that specific phrase he used involving the president of the United States." Blitzer’s interview made waves through the political world, so we wanted to check his assertion about the words "subhuman mongrel." In his CNN interview, Blitzer cited the work of Nazi party official Julius Streicher. But our research shows Blitzer is correct well beyond an individual Nazi party official. The words subhuman and mongrel were used interchangeably but generally had the same derogatory meaning. David Myers, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, said Adolph Hitler used the word "untermensch" or subhuman in his book Mein Kampf in 1925. "From that point forward, it was part of the Nazi lexicon," Myers said. "That and ‘mischling’ or mongrel, were intoned with daily regularity by the Nazi propaganda machine." The man Blitzer mentioned, Streicher, was an early Nazi party leader in Nuremberg and Franconia and a fierce anti-Semite. In the mid 1920s, he began publishing a tabloid aimed at the working class called Der Sturmer, "The Attacker." The front of each edition carried the slogan, "The Jews are our misfortune." In 1935, Der Sturmer carried a student essay that parrotted the teaching materials in the classroom. Here is the English translation: "Regrettably, there are still many people today who say: Even the Jews are creatures of God. Therefore you must respect them. But we say: Vermin are animals too, but we exterminate them just the same. The Jew is a mongrel. He has hereditary tendencies from Aryans, Asiatics, Negroes, and from the Mongolians. Evil always preponderates in the case of a mongrel." In 1899, the English anti-Semite Houston Stewart Chamberlain wrote extensively about physical characteristics and race. He claimed "the Semites belong to the mulatto class, a transition stage between black and white" and were "a mongrel race which always retains this mongrel character." In 1942, the Nazis printed an infamous pamphlet, Der Untermensch, which translates to "subhuman." The Holocaust Research Project translation provides this front panel quote from the head of the German SS, Heinrich Himmler: "As long as there have been men on the Earth, the struggle between man and the subhuman will be the historic rule; the Jewish-led struggle against the mankind, as far back as we can look, is part of the natural course of life on our planet. One can be convinced with full certainty that this struggle for life and death is just as much a law of nature as is the struggle of an infection to corrupt a healthy body." Mark Roseman, director of the Borns Jewish Studies Program at Indiana University, said the German word for subhuman, untermensch, did not tend to be used by the Nazis in the adjectival form. So the words weren't often used in combination. "But the underlying claim, namely, that Nazi policies were preceded, facilitated, and accompanied by language that compared Jews to animals, and declared them to be subhuman, is of course absolutely correct," Roseman said. Our ruling Blitzer said the words "subhuman mongrel" were used by the Nazis to "justify the genocide of the Jewish community." We found ample evidence that the Nazis used those words -- in their own language -- to repeatedly describe Jewish people in the build-up to the Holocaust. We rate his statement True.

pomt-03466	"Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/16/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-says-70-percent-new-jerseyans-want-m/	There’s no denying that support for same-sex marriage has grown in New Jersey during the past few years. Polls done on the issue show that support for it has climbed above 50 percent and is nearing a two-thirds majority, according to recent results released by a handful of major polling organizations. The consenus is so strong, according to Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester), that New Jersey may be headed toward a number indicating support from three-quarters of state residents. "Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality," Sweeney said during an interview earlier this month on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ Sweeney, who abstained when a same-sex marriage bill came before the Legislature three years ago, now supports it. The 70 percent figure would be the highest level of support for same-sex marriage ever polled in New Jersey – if it were true. But it’s not. Let’s begin by reviewing polls done in New Jersey on same-sex marriage. Back in April, the Rutgers-Eagleton poll asked 819 registered voters if they would vote for legalizing same-sex marriage if the question appeared on a ballot. Of those who answered, 62 percent said yes, 30 percent said no and 8 percent were undecided, said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percent. We then checked with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which had a slightly higher approval rating for this question asked in March: Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married? The poll found 64 percent of registered voters in favor, the highest level Quinnipiac has seen in response to that exact question since 2006, when support was at 41 percent. Thirty percent were opposed. The same poll found that 72 percent of New Jerseyans say it’s a good idea to decide the same-sex marriage issue by referendum on the November ballot. Let’s be clear: Sweeney’s claim of 70 percent support only rings true when voters are asked if same-sex marriage should go on the ballot. Favorability for same-sex marriage is closer to 60 percent when voters are asked if they would support laws allowing it. Quinnipiac’s poll surveyed 1,129 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/-2.9 percent. The Monmouth University Poll also has polled on this topic and seen numbers near 60 percent that support same-sex marriage, with favorability increasing each year. "There has been a significant uptick in the last year or two," said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll. "We’re at the point now where we’re at a solid majority." Murray cited a number of reasons for the increase, including President Barack Obama publicly stating his support in May 2012 for same-sex marriage. "It was naturally going in that direction," Murray said. "When the president made his statement it kind of cemented that. We saw an immediate uptick in African-American support." But even as that support grows, neither Redlawsk nor Murray said they’ve seen approval numbers hitting the 70 percent mark claimed by Sweeney. Quinnipiac also hasn’t seen support that high. We also looked at other polls to gauge national support and those numbers didn’t approach 70 percent, either. A May Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans said the law should recognize same-sex marriage, marking the third time Gallup has measured a reading above 50 percent on the issue. The poll surveyed 1,535 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percent. The poll asked: Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages? An October Pew Research Center poll, done two weeks before the November 2012 general election, found different regions of the country had widely disparate attitudes on same-sex marriage. Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC) favored same-sex marriage 57 percent to 34 percent, the poll showed. New England states had the highest level of support, at 62 percent. Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for New Jersey Senate Democrats who responded to our initial request for comment from Sweeney, did not answer our question about the source of Sweeney’s number. Our ruling Sweeney said during a recent TV interview, "Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality." It’s clear that support for same-sex marriage is growing, but it’s not at the level mentioned by Sweeney. A number of polls on the topic cite support ranging from just below 60 percent to a high of 64 percent, and two New Jersey polling directors say they have never seen support levels for same-sex marriage hit 70 percent. National polls also indicate lower support levels. We rate the claim False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Stephen Sweeney	None	None	None	2013-06-16T07:30:00	2013-06-01	['New_Jersey']

pomt-02931	"West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/31/julie-parrish/west-linn-national-leader-number-home-businesses-p/	For more than a decade, economists have charted a pronounced trend toward more home-based businesses. Nationally, the number of people working from home increased by 2 million from 2005 to 2010, according to the U.S. Census. In Oregon, the city of West Linn has long claimed a relatively high number of home-based businesses, with City Council members and others routinely referring to the city as having one of the highest rates per capita in the state. Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, took things to a new level during the recent legislative special session, when she spoke on the floor to support a small-business tax cut. She said the proposed cuts would save enough for many businesses to hire an additional employee, then added, "West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States." That caught our attention. Does West Linn’s per capita rate of home-based businesses top almost anywhere in the country? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We contacted Parrish by email and received a quick reply. She cited a May 2, 2013, article in the West Linn Tidings newspaper. The article, referring to U.S. Census data, stated that West Linn ranked second in Oregon in the rate of home-based businesses per capita at 8.9 percent. Only Lake Oswego, at 10.9 percent, ranked higher. Parrish offered additional figures to bolster her case. As of April, she said, 2,769 businesses with West Linn addresses were registered with the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. Further, West Linn has a population of about 25,600 and 9,779 households, according to the 2010 Census. Of those, 777 units are vacant. That leaves 2,769 businesses spread among about 9,000 households. Suitably crunched, those numbers indicate that about 28 percent of households have a registered business, Parrish said, adding, "Of course, not all of those are going to be home-based." From there, however, the slope got more slippery. We took Parrish up on her suggestion to contact West Linn City Councilor Thomas Frank, who, she said, had cited 2010 Census Bureau data for statewide numbers of home-based businesses in one of his recent blog posts. Frank said West Linn used to call itself Oregon’s leader when it came to the number of home-based businesses. He then cited the same figures used in the West Linn Tidings article. Asked whether West Linn had, as Parrish stated, one of the highest per capita rates in the nation, Frank said, "I’ve not heard that one before." Next, at Frank’s suggestion, we turned to Chris Kerr, West Linn’s economic development director. He also could not pinpoint the origin of West Linn’s reputation for having a high concentration of home-based businesses. "I have heard similar statements about the comparatively large number/percentage of home-based businesses in West Linn," Kerr wrote by email. "However, I am not familiar with any comparative data on this subject; certainly not related to the national averages or on a per capita basis." In the end, neither he, Frank nor anyone else contacted by PolitiFact Oregon could cite numbers supporting the notion that West Linn is a leader in home-based enterprises, even though that’s been the conventional wisdom for years. Kerr said the city probably does have a beefy number of home-based businesses because of its high percentage of residential to nonresidential land. The city last year listed 1,245 licensed businesses -- far fewer than the state listed for West Linn -- of which 423 were at residences. The discrepancy underscores the difficulty of finding precise numbers. Kerr noted that some of those homes were listed for mailing-address purposes only. Other home businesses don’t bother to get licenses in hopes of avoiding regulation or licensing fees. "I’ve been told that Southeast Portland has an unusually high number of home-based businesses, but there’s no way to prove it," said Eric Norberg, longtime president of the Association of Home Businesses in Portland. "Cities don’t tabulate that separately, and many home businesses have no desire to tell anyone but their customers what they are doing." Still, we wondered whether cities can be ranked according to their per capita rates of home-based businesses. Yes, said Jason Jurjevich, assistant director of Portland State University’s Population Research Center, but not by using full Census statistics. Instead, data along these lines come from the Economic Census, a survey of business owners conducted every five years. The problem is it’s a relatively small survey and doesn’t produce information down to cities the size of West Linn, Jurjevich said. The single source of information that could be used that way -- Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS -- requires population sets of at least 100,000. Of West Linn, he said: "It’s too small." The Census’ annual American Community Survey also gathers data from businesses and homeowners. In a question asking how many people work from home, 8.5 percent of West Linn respondents answered yes (not the 8.9 percent listed in the Tidings article). But there’s no way to determine how many are simply employees who work from home. To Parrish’s credit, she promised to continue looking for "the specific numbers," adding, "I’m willing to acknowledge that I don’t have them in hand." She stood by saying West Linn has "one of the highest" per capita ratings in Oregon, despite the fact that no one could point to specific data to back that up. But back to her original claim to House colleagues that West Linn has "one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States." It’s conceivably possible that’s true, but Parrish could offer no substantiation. And we found that no such statistics exist on a city the size of West Linn. In such cases, PolitiFact rates the claim False.	None	Julie Parrish	None	None	None	2013-10-31T16:54:36	2013-10-02	['United_States']

pomt-05554	Adding ethanol to gas "raises food costs."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/06/james-durkan/tennessee-senate-candidate-says-putting-ethanol-ga/	Whether or not it’s a good idea to add ethanol to gasoline is a debate that has been around for years. One of the key disputes has been the impact ethanol-infused gas has on food supplies and food prices. Such highly charged topics often make great fodder for candidates looking to score a few political points, and U.S. Senate candidate James Durkan is one of the latest to thrust himself into the debate. Durkan, of Chattanooga, had intended to be one of the Republicans challenging U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., in the state’s GOP primary, but was not successful in filing a qualifying petition (see note below). On his campaign website, Durkan outlines his three-step plan for lowering gas prices. One of his suggestions is to take ethanol out of gas. "Why put it in?" he wrote. "It raises food costs." We called Durkan and asked what sources he was using as the basis for his claim. "It’s common knowledge that it raises the price of food," he said. "Just say we got that information from various sources." Pressed further, Durkan refused to cite any sources for his statement. "We know that we’ve heard it, and we know that it’s true," he said. Asked again for his sources, Durkan replied, "I would rather just say radio and television and the newspaper." Saying something is "common knowledge" might be good enough for someone running for office, but not for PolitiFact Tennessee. So we decided to run Durkan’s claim through the Truth-o-Meter. First, a little background, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin. Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. For decades, the industry was encouraged – and propped up – by a controversial package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs. Last year, after a series of bitter political fights, Congress allowed the federal ethanol subsidies to expire. One reason for the political battle was the argument that ethanol diverted too much corn from food to fuel and that it caused food prices to rise. It also is worth noting that the percentage of corn used for fuel could rise -- an ethanol blend known as E15 passed a key regulatory hurdle on Monday. The Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies for ethanol, has vigorously disputed that claim, arguing on its website that tremendous increases in the productivity of U.S. farmers have ensured ample supplies of grain are available for domestic and international use as food, feed and fuel. The association concedes that using corn to produce ethanol could impact food prices, but argues that other factors, such as energy costs, play a much bigger role in driving up the price of food. "No reasonable advocate for American ethanol will tell you that using corn to produce ethanol has no impact on food prices," the association wrote in a policy position on its web site. "But to suggest that the driving factor behind the rise in food prices is our effort to develop a domestic renewable ethanol industry is disingenuous." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked into ethanol’s impact on food costs at the request of U.S. Reps. Ron Kind, D-Wis.; Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; and James McGovern, D-Mass. In its 2009 report, "The Impact of Ethanol Use on Food Prices and Greenhouse-Gas Emissions," the agency estimated that the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. The report also said ethanol boosted federal spending on programs to feed the needy by an estimated $600 million to $900 million. The reason: Nearly 3 billion bushels of corn were used to produce ethanol in the United States in 2008. That was an increase of nearly a billion bushels over the previous year. The demand for corn for ethanol production, along with other factors, exerted upward pressure on corn prices, which rose by more than 50 percent between April 2007 and April 2008. Rising demand for corn also increased the demand for cropland and the price of animal feed. Those effects in turn raised the price of many farm commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, raised the retail price of food. Pushed up in part by those effects and by surges in the price of energy, food prices rose by almost 2.5 percent in 2006, by 4 percent in 2007 and by 5.1 percent in 2008. But the report also noted that other factors, including transportation and energy costs, also had an impact on food prices. In fact, the report found that higher energy prices were more responsible for driving up the cost of food than ethanol production was. The increase in energy prices accounted for nearly a quarter (22 percent) of the 5.1 percent jump in food prices between 2007 and 2008, the report said. In 2011, Iowa State University economists Bruce A. Babcock and Jacinto F. Fabiosa reached a similar conclusion in their report, "The Impact of Ethanol and Ethanol Subsidies on Corn Prices: Revisiting History." "It is disingenuous to argue that there is no link between ethanol production and corn prices," the report said. "And there is a direct link between higher corn prices and food costs because higher corn prices translate directly into higher feed costs, which eventually translate into higher prices for meat, eggs and dairy products." However, "the price of corn is not solely determined by ethanol," the report noted. The expansion of corn ethanol from subsidies and market forces accounted for 36 percent of the average increase in corn prices from 2006 to 2009, the report concluded. But, "all other market forces counted for 64 percent of the corn price increase," the report said. Our ruling Studies show increased ethanol production has driven up the price of corn and other food commodities, such as soybeans, meat, poultry and dairy products. That, in turn, has contributed to a higher retail price of food. Yet those same studies show that other factors, particularly energy prices, have an even bigger impact on the cost of food than ethanol production. We rate the claim Mostly True. *The Tennessee Secretary of State's office now tells us that James Durkan did not file for U.S. Senate and is not a candidate. Durkan told us the day after the April 5 filing deadline that he had indeed filed and didn't understand why his name was not on the Secretary of State's list of candidates for the office. Durkan said he could not remember exactly when he filed his paperwork, but thought it was sometime in 2010. But Blake Fontenay, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office, told us in an email on April 11 that candidates can start filing qualifying petitions up to 90 days before the filing deadline. Fontenay said Durkan missed the deadline to pick up a petition and file. Contacted again and asked for clarification, Durkan said simply: "We have no comment, sir."

pomt-00116	"National Geographic’s photo of the year" is a great white shark leaping out of the water.	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/29/blog-posting/shark-photo-has-never-and-will-never-be-nat-geo-ph/	A Facebook account that posts wildlife photography has jumped the shark. In May, the account shared an image of what appears to be a great white breaching, soaring above the surf. "National Geographic’s photo of the year," the caption says. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo was posted by a Facebook account called "The Planet Today" and it’s been shared more than 300,000 times. The account did not immediately respond to a message seeking the source of the photo. National Geographic also did not immediately respond to an email asking about the Facebook post. However, searching for the image on Google reveals a number of posts that pre-date 2018. In February 2017, for example, a Twitter user tapped the image for some early-morning inspiration. "Do sharks complain about it being Monday?" he tweeted. "No, they are up early, biting stuff, chasing food, being scary, reminding everyone they’re a shark." The shark has shown up on Pinterest and blogs. But we couldn’t find any credible websites connecting it to National Geographic. National Geographic does has an annual Travel Photographer of the Year competition. The grand prize this year was awarded to Reiko Takahashi, who photographed a humpback whale. The shark wasn’t the photo of the year in 2016, either, when this same shark pic was making the rounds on social media. In December 2016, National Geographic posted a blog refuting a claim that the photo was its photo of the year—an award the magazine doesn’t have. But editor Daniel Stone took the opportunity to blast fake news as a "threat to those of us in the business of telling the truth." He also shared 14 real shark photos. Check them out here.

pomt-13063	Texas A&M University - Commerce "offers counseling, safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/nov/17/sid-miller/sid-miller-says-texas-university-trump-safe-spaces/	Two days after the November 2016 elections, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller took note on his Facebook page of a web post suggesting a Texas A&M University campus was offering counseling and "safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump." Did the cowboy-hatted Republican, who was Donald Trump’s most-cited Texan in the days before the vote, highlight accurate information? Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, 2016, after more than 18 months of a bitter campaign--and nationally after the election, at least 43 colleges and universities offered support services, according to news reports, with some reporting spurts in students seeking counseling. Miller, who gleefully received news on Nov. 9, 2016, that he was among individuals under Trump’s consideration for U.S. secretary of agriculture, carries a reputation for provocative social media posts, including a Facebook post suggesting a nuclear strike on "the Muslim world" and a Twitter post he later deleted and attributed to an outside employee calling Clinton a vulgar name. For our part, we noticed that on Nov. 10, 2016, Miller shared an article from the website IAmATexan.com, headlined "Texas university offers counseling, safe spaces for students who are afraid of president-elect Trump;" five days later, Miller’s pass-along had been shared by others more than 4,400 times. Web post refers to 'pinko-commie-coddling letter' "I never thought I’d see this in Texas," said the post from I Am A Texan, a right-leaning news blog that posts daily articles on Texas culture and national issues. The website’s article said that an email with an attached "pinko-commie-coddling letter" had been sent to the entire student body at Texas A&M University - Commerce. The university, which enrolled about 12,300 students in fall 2015, is in Hunt County, which Trump carried with 76 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 20 percent. And according to I Am A Texan, the letter offered counseling services to students with election-related stress, "outlining all the ways that the university was prepared to help its fragile students who can’t bear the thought of living now that Donald Trump has won the election." Administrator: No intent to focus on fears of Trump And did the university spell out ways for students to deal with fears of Trump? To get a fix on that, we reached out to Tomás Aguirre, the university's assistant vice president and dean of students; Aguirre’s digital signature was stamped on the email that included the attached letter. By phone, Aguirre confirmed the authenticity of the posted email, which was blank save this subject line: "An Open Letter to Students: How to De-Stress from Election." Aguirre also insisted there was no administration intent to focus on students fearful of the president-elect, who was not mentioned in the letter. Miller spokesman bemoans student 'wusses' We also emailed Miller’s office, and got a phone call in response from spokesman Todd Smith, who said, "Who else would they be offering emotional counseling to if not people opposed to Donald Trump being president?" Smith’s point: Trump fans would have been happy--not in need of counseling--after election day. "Commissioner Miller believes that the mere fact that college students need counseling after a presidential election is a sad commentary on the state of our nation and many of its young people," Smith said. "Commissioner Miller thinks they’re a bunch of wusses." University's letter So exactly what offer did the university make? By email, Aguirre sent us a copy of the original "open letter," pictured below, which he said was emailed to students on Nov. 10, 2016. The letter doesn’t mention Trump or any candidate by name. It opens by calling the national election cycle "a particularly stressful one." Next, it says the Counseling Center staff "wants to acknowledge a range of reactions you might be experiencing Including excitement, joy, relief, fear, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness, anxiety, and numbness." The letter’s second paragraph opens: "We are here to listen and support you as our nation works through this election transition." It goes on to offer services especially to students "struggling with the impact of the election or the tone of the national discussion" and students who have experienced negative treatment because of "race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, country of origin or other aspects of your identity." The letter closes with tips for students at "this highly emotional time for our nation" to remain productive. That comes after a sentence stating the center "provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election." By phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine’s Day. Aguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school’s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn’t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling. A student's comment We wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter. So we messaged the Facebook page for the College Republicans at Texas A&M University - Commerce, and got a response from Michael Faz, the group’s vice president. Faz, a senior majoring in political science, said by phone that Aguirre "sends those emails out all the time," up to a few times a month. Faz said he read the letter himself but doubted that most students did. The College Republicans on campus, Faz said, did not feel the reminder of support services was a message catered to students fearful of Trump. "We didn’t think anything of it," Faz said. Our ruling Miller posted an article saying Texas A&M University - Commerce was offering counseling and "safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump." After the election, the university sent a letter to students describing its counseling center as a "safe space." Yet that letter didn’t specifically mention Trump while offering services for students experiencing varied reactions. We rate Miller’s statement Half True.

pomt-15212	Says Donald Trump has "changed his mind" on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/11/carly-fiorina/fiorina-trumps-abortion-flip-flop/	Of all the leading Republican candidates, Donald Trump’s credentials on the issue of abortion are the most spotty. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina made sure to highlight this during the first Republican presidential debate. When asked about Trump’s top position in the polls, Fiorina explained that Trump has connected with a legitimate frustration. "Whatever your issue, your cause, the festering problem you hoped would (be) resolved, the political class has failed you," Fiorina said. "That's just a fact, and that's what Donald Trump taps into. I would also just say this. Since he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I would just ask, what are the principles by which he will govern?" In this fact-check, we assess whether Trump has changed his mind on abortion. Fiorina’s staff apparently was so sure this would come up, a day after the debate, they posted a page on their campaign website with supporting information. They cited articles from the Washington Post and National Journal that documented Trump’s shift from saying he was pro-choice to now saying he is pro-life. 'I am very pro-choice' Trump’s flirtations with a presidential bid have put him on record at various moments in a couple of election cycles. In 1999, he appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he was thinking about a third-party run. "I am very pro-choice," Trump said. "I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I hear people debating the subject." When pressed on whether he would ban a procedure called "partial-birth" by abortion foes, Trump said, "No. I would not. I am pro-choice in every respect as far as it goes, but I just hate it." In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, Trump affirmed his basic position, but reversed his stand on that one particular procedure. "There are some issues I don’t want to say much about. I support a woman’s right to choose, for example, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures. When Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial-birth abortion if I were president, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban." So, as of 2000, Trump has "pro-choice instincts." 'I'm pro-life' In mid February 2011, with Trump again fueling speculation that he would run for president, he spoke at the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Committee. In his 14-minute speech, he made this simple declaration: "I am pro-life." A few months later in April, he sat down with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s political correspondent, who asked if he would really stand by his new belief. Here is what Trump said: "One thing about me, I’m a very honorable guy. I’m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the reasons I changed — one of the primary reasons — a friend of mine, his wife was pregnant, in this case married. She was pregnant, and ... he didn’t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He’s crying as he’s telling me. They ended up for some reason, amazingly, through luck because they didn’t have the right timing, he ends up having the baby, and the baby is the apple of his eye. He said, it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to him. And you know, here’s a baby that wasn’t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life." So, by 2011, Trump opposed abortion. These days, he often re-tells the story about his friend’s unplanned child. A curious interruption Trump clarified his stance on abortion in a January interview with Mark Halperin of Bloomberg News. Trump said the only exceptions to banning abortions would be to protect the life of the mother or in cases of incest or rape. But we noted this twist in that brief discussion: Trump: "With caveats, life of the mother, incest and rape. And that’s where I stand. So I’m pro-life, but with the caveats. It’s life of the mother,very important, incest and rape." Halperin: "So say a woman is pregnant and it’s not in any of those exception categories and she chooses to have an abortion, should she --" Trump: "It depends when, it depends when. It depends when." Halperin: "Well let’s say early in her pregnancy." Trump: "Excuse me. If it’s not in any of those -- pro-life. Mark it’s very simple. Pro-life." Trump interrupted Halperin to say "it depends when." We reached out to Trump’s campaign and asked what he meant. We did not hear back. Our ruling Fiorina said that Trump changed his mind on abortion, and by Trump’s own admission, that is accurate. As late as 2000, he wrote that he was pro-choice. By 2011, he said he was pro-life. Recently, he noted that he thinks exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape are appropriate. We find some murkiness in his repetition of "It depends when," but that doesn’t change the fundamental finding. We rate this claim True.

pomt-13763	Says Hillary Clinton "supported North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization…. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trumps-largely-accurate-about-clintons-past/	At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump repeated his months-long criticism of Hillary Clinton’s past support of free trade deals, a position in stark contrast to his own. (Trump says his superior negotiating skills will result in better deals.) "She supported (the North American Free Trade Agreement), and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization — another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership." This is largely accurate, but it’s worth noting that Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, nor is it clear that the South Korean deal is a job-killer. Let’s go through Clinton’s position on these deals one by one. NAFTA As first lady, Clinton spoke favorably of NAFTA — the North American Free Trade Agreement — signed by President Bill Clinton. "I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth," said Clinton, according to a 1996 Associated Press report. "Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization," she wrote in her 2003 memoir, Living History, which the Trump campaign cited in a press release. "Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal." But a few years later, she changed her position on the deal during her first White House bid. In 2007, she called NAFTA a "mistake" and said it "hurt a lot of American workers." Why the change of heart? According to the 2008 Clinton camp, she was always skeptical of the deal. But the first lady was "not supposed to deviate from the position of the administration," Robert Shapiro, the undersecretary of commerce under Bill Clinton, told the Huffington Post. China’s inclusion in the WTO While campaigning for Senate in 2000, Clinton voiced reservations about China’s entrance into the WTO, but was supportive overall. Here’s what she said at a CNN forum in April of that year, which was cited by the Trump campaign: "I share the concerns that many of my supporters in organized labor have expressed to me, because I do think we have to make sure that we improve labor rights, we improve environmental standards in our bilateral and our multilateral trade agreements. But on balance, I've looked at this, I've studied it, I think it is in the interests of America and American workers that we provide the option for China to go into the WTO. Right now, we are trading with China. We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace." (According to news reports from 1999, then-Reform Party member Trump opposed the United States’ inclusion in the WTO, period.) China became a member of the WTO in December 2001, with the support of President George W. Bush. Since then, Clinton hasn’t reversed her position, as far as we can tell, but has advocated for using the WTO to bring trade cases against China. (This is also Trump’s current position.) Deal with South Korea During her 2008 presidential run, Clinton opposed a pending free trade deal with South Korea (as well as other deals with Colombia and Panama). "While I value the strong relationship the United States enjoys with South Korea, I believe that this agreement is inherently unfair," she told the AFL-CIO in June 2007. "The South Korean agreement does not create a level playing field for American carmakers," she said in a November 2007 campaign statement. But as secretary of state, she supported the deal advocated by the administration. At an April 2011 gathering of business leaders in Seoul, Clinton said the deal was "profoundly in America's strategic interest" and "a priority for me, for President Obama and for the entire administration." (In 2008, Obama also was against the deal.) When the deal entered into force in March 2012, Clinton touted it as a "historic milestone" that will "provide a significant economic boost to both of our economies" and "strengthen the U.S. partnership with a key ally in a strategically important region." Does this deal kill jobs, as Trump says? The jury is still out. On one hand, the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-focused think tank, which Trump has cited, has found that the South Korean deal cost about 60,000 U.S. jobs. On the other, the Obama administration has argued the deal actually creates jobs. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker, meanwhile, looked at the the evidence and found both estimates of job losses and job gains are fishy. An independent analysis by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected a decline in manufacturing and service jobs and an increase in agriculture and food, beverage and tobacco jobs. But overall, the net impact on employment would be zero. TPP As we’ve detailed quite extensively, Clinton once hailed TPP as setting "the gold standard in trade agreements" during her time in the Obama administration, but she came out in opposition during her 2016 bid. Though she’s always said the details needed to be hammered out, her comments about the deal were largely supportive from 2010 to 2013. Here are some of the words she used to describe TPP: "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high quality," "high standard" and "gold standard." In October 2015, Clinton flip-flopped and opposed it, telling PBS, "I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization…. She supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership." Trump is right that Clinton once supported NAFTA and TPP and has yet to revoke her support for China’s inclusion in the WTO or the deal with South Korea. But there are caveats. Clinton no longer supports NAFTA or TPP, and it’s not entirely clear that trade with South Korea has killed jobs. Trump’s statement is accurate because it’s carefully phrased, but it needs additional context. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/68c1a4d5-56ad-4a84-87b6-564b5037df5b	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T23:27:09	2016-07-21	['South_Korea', 'North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement', 'China', 'Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation']

pomt-03787	"In this city, there hasn’t been a stadium that’s lasted more than 27 years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/29/cleta-winslow/does-councilwoman-score-stadium-longevity-claim/	Some critics of the proposed $1 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta have raised questions about the idea. One question that keeps surfacing: "What’s wrong with the Georgia Dome?" Atlanta City Councilwoman Cleta Winslow tried to answer that question during a March 18 council meeting in which she voted in favor of the financial framework for a new stadium. The measure passed 11-4. The Georgia Dome may seem spry to some. But in stadium years, it’s pretty old, Winslow said. "It may be a young stadium, but in this city, there isn’t a stadium that’s lasted more than 27 years," she said. The Georgia Dome opened in 1992. We wondered how did Winslow’s math stack up when applied to other Atlanta sports facilities? Winslow later mentioned the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and the Omni Arena in her remarks during the council meeting. Her council district includes several southwest Atlanta neighborhoods near Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves. Twenty-three of the 30 stadiums currently used by National Football League teams are younger than the Georgia Dome. The New York Giants and Jets share use of MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Most of the older stadiums have been renovated. The San Francisco 49ers are moving into a new stadium under construction in Santa Clara, Calif. Now, back to Atlanta. Let’s begin with three venues that were built a century ago or more. The councilwoman was referring to professional sports facilities in the city, so she was not referring to venues such as Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, which was built in 1913. The stadium’s most recent renovation was completed in 2003. A minor-league baseball team, the Atlanta Crackers, played at Ponce de Leon Park from 1907 to 1965. The stadium had a seating capacity of 20,000, making it one of the largest minor-league facilities in the country. The bleachers were segregated by race. Babe Ruth once hit a home run into dead center field (462 feet), where a giant magnolia tree stood. The park was torn down in 1966. The site is now a retail shopping center anchored by a Home Depot. That stadium was in use for 58 years and stood for 59. In 1909, the Atlanta Municipal Auditorium opened. It was used for cultural events, an armory, a soup kitchen during the Great Depression, speeches by Presidents Teddy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Grateful Dead concerts. It was also used for some sports events. The giant ivory structure was the venue for wrestling matches in the 1950s. It was also the site of Muhammad Ali’s return to the fight game in 1970, after his boxing license was reinstated in Georgia. Ali scored a technical knockout over Jerry Quarry, who seemed to spill more blood than land punches in that bout. The building, located at what’s now Gilmer and Courtland streets in downtown Atlanta, was sold to Georgia State University in 1980 and is now its Alumni Hall. There are currently three pro sports franchises who play within the city limits, the Braves, Falcons and Hawks. The Omni Colesium was built in 1972 and was home to the Atlanta Hawks. It was also home to the National Hockey League’s Atlanta Flames from 1972 to 1980, before they moved to Calgary. In the mid- to late 1980s, Hawks home games were the hottest ticket in town as fans poured in to see star forward Dominique Wilkins, who was known as the Human Highlight Film for his acrobatic dunks and prolific scoring. The Omni became history in 1997, 25 years after it opened. Its eventual replacement, Philips Arena, opened in 1999. Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium opened in 1965. It's original name was Atlanta Stadium. The Crackers played there that year. The Braves moved there in 1966. For years, it was home to the Braves and Falcons. Baseball fans -- who grew used to seeing home runs hit there by Hank Aaron and other Braves power hitters -- knew it as the Launching Pad. In 1997, the Braves moved across the street to Turner Field, which was initially built for track and field events for the 1996 Summer Olympics. After 32 years of service, the old Launching Pad was turned into a parking lot. Winslow said through a City Council spokesman that she made an error. To sum up, the councilwoman said there hasn’t been a stadium in Atlanta that’s lasted more than 27 years, referring to sports facilities used by professional teams. Most pro football stadiums are younger than the Georgia Dome. In Atlanta, Winslow was correct on the Omni but off by five years when you consider Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. On balance, we rate her claim Half True.	None	Cleta Winslow	None	None	None	2013-03-29T06:00:00	2013-03-18	['None']
pomt-09215	"Taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" in California are "a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/19/steve-poizner/california-gop-candidate-blames-obama-health-care-/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the nomination. One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that "like Schwarzenegger," Whitman "will continue taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals. A skyrocketing cost under Obamacare." We'll acknowledge some uncertainty about the statement's meaning because of its somewhat curious syntax. (Confusing matters further, the first sentence is read by a man, and the subsequent fragment by a woman.) However, we believe a reasonable person would interpret it to mean that a policy of continuing "taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" would mean "a skyrocketing cost" due to the newly passed federal health care law. Whitman's press office did not respond to several inquiries from PolitiFact. The candidate's website does not directly address the question of whether she would continue "taxpayer-funded benefits to illegals" in the health care realm, though it does say that she advocates curbing state benefits for illegal immigrants in two other areas -- barring them from attending state-funded colleges and universities and preventing them from securing drivers' licenses. As for the question of whether the federal health care law will lead to skyrocketing costs, it would be incorrect to say that the new federal law is poised to increase California's costs directly. Written into the federal law is a clearly worded provision that prevents illegal immigrants from taking advantage of the law's benefits, such as the health care exchanges where uninsured Americans can compare plans and purchase coverage. But the Poizner campaign argues that the new law could have an indirect impact on California's deeply strained budget. The federal bill expands Medicaid eligibility to all Americans earning up to 133 percent of the poverty line. "This will lead to more illegal immigrants enrolling, because California provides a version of Medicaid to illegal immigrants," Poizner's campaign press secretary, Bettina Inclán, told PolitiFact. But it's wrong to assume that illegal immigrants will qualify for full-blown Medicaid in California. In fact, the only entitlement they get from Medicaid is emergency care in hospitals, which is already mandatory under federal law and was not changed by the newly passed health care bill. These limited benefits are available to any illegal immigrant who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid were it not for their immigration status. (Illegal immigrants can also qualify for Medicaid benefits for long-term care, but it's not an entitlement -- coverage is provided only to the extent that legislators and the governor agree to fund the program, and there's no federal match.) Right now, emergency care for illegal immigrants in California is paid by the state and local government. To the extent that more illegal immigrants will now qualify for California's version of Medicaid (known as Medi-Cal) and use emergency hospital services, the only difference will be a shift of payment responsibility from one state or local account to another. (Whether the federal government will continue to pick up part of the cost for treating illegal immigrants using Medi-Cal -- as the federal government does today -- is unclear, given the new bill's language.) Take pregnancy care. There shouldn't be any new costs, because Medi-Cal already covers pregnant women up to 185 percent of the poverty line, which is more generous than the 133 percent in the federal law. As a result, undocumented immigrants who need emergency delivery would already have been on emergency Medicaid anyway. The Poizner campaign has a point that coverage of emergency care for illegal immigrants -- including pregnancy costs -- is not cheap, costing upwards of $800 million a year. And that amount seems destined to rise, judging by the recent history of inflation in the health care sector and perhaps an increase in the number of illegal immigrants residing in the state. So the state's burden for providing health care to illegal immigrants may go up, but it is not accurate for the Poizner campaign to blame that development either on the new federal health care law or on the Democratic president who pushed for it. The new federal law specifically prevents illegal immigrants from benefitting, and most of the additional indirect costs that might be expected from expanding the Medicaid rolls are already being paid in California by different state or local government accounts. For these reasons, the phrase "a skyrocketing cost under Obamacare" is a gross exaggeration. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10570	In the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama "voted 'present,' instead of yes or no" on seven votes involving abortion rights.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/06/hillary-clinton/he-voted-present-which-is-similar-to-no/	As the Democratic race has tightened, the Hillary Clinton campaign has portrayed Sen. Barack Obama as inconsistent on abortion rights. "In the Illinois state Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted 'present,' instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a women's right to choose," Sen. Clinton said in a December 2007 speech in Iowa. In the days leading up to Super Tuesday on Feb. 5, 2008, several other groups repeated the charge against Obama via e-mails. The facts here are not in dispute. Obama did vote present on seven bills that attempted to restrict abortion. His defenders argue that it was a tactic to disrupt legislation that would be used against Democrats in swing districts. It's worth pausing here to explain what the "present" vote means. The Illinois Legislature allows members to vote "yes," "no," or "present." Bills need "yes" votes to pass, so a vote of "present" counts the same as a "no." Thus, Obama's "present" votes on bills seeking to restrict abortion counted the same as if he had voted "no." All of the bills passed by in the Senate by sizable margins. The seven votes were on proposals that abortion opponents have successfully passed in other places. Two bills outlawed the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Two bills required parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Three bills were for so-called "born alive" legislation, which require doctors to administer medical care to aborted fetuses that survive the abortion process in hopes that the fetuses can survive. No one questions that Obama opposed the seven pieces of legislation; indeed, he is mentioned in news reports from the time as being against several of the measures. Rather, Obama's critics say he ducked a "no" vote; supporters say it was a tactical move. Those interpretations seem to have split the leaders of the Illinois abortion rights movement. Obama should have voted "no" on those bills, said Bonnie Grabenhofer, president of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Clinton. "We think the way you talk about a bill and the way you stand up is important," she said. "It was a strategy that allowed people to take political cover as opposed to talking about why the bill was a bad bill and clearly saying no." But Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, said Obama was helping advance a prochoice agenda by voting present. "He always was going to vote 'no' on these bills. We needed to keep some of our moderate Democrats from voting yes, which is something you never want to happen," Sutherland said. By having a well-known supporter of abortion rights also vote present, it gave other Democrats cover, she said. Regardless of the interpretation of the "present" votes, Obama has received extremely positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights. Even Grabenhofer's organization, the NOW Illinois political action committee, endorsed Obama twice after the "present" votes. The group did not endorse in the U.S. Senate race in 2004, she said, in part because of the present votes. Steve Trombley of Planned Parenthood in Chicago has defended Obama's prochoice bona fides, even though Planned Parenthood has not endorsed in the race. "Barack Obama has always been committed to a woman's right to choose. He has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record both in the U.S. Senate and the Illinois Senate," Trombley wrote in a statement posted on the Obama campaign Web site. "I don't know why Illinois NOW has changed its opinion of Barack Obama since his record has remained the same and since his time as a state senator, he has only demonstrated a full and steady commitment to choice," Trombley added. Both Clinton and Obama have their supporters among the abortion rights movement. Clinton arguably has the bigger endorsements. She has been endorsed by the National Organization for Women and EMILY's List, an organization dedicated to electing prochoice women. Obama has some high-profile endorsements as well, such as Kate Michelman, former president, NARAL Prochoice America, who sided with Obama after John Edwards dropped out of the race. Obama also has the support of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the first executive director of EMILY's List, who has publicly defended Obama as a strong supporter of abortion rights. We checked her statement here and found it to be True. Two other large groups, NARAL Prochoice America and Planned Parenthood, are not endorsing. Planned Parenthood, however, has given both candidates 100 percent ratings for their records on abortion. We stipulate that there are clearly different interpretations of the significance of Obama's "present" votes. But there's no doubt he made them. So we find Clinton's statement to be True.

pomt-14913	The CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he "renegotiated it down to two hours."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-v-john-harwood-length-cnbc-debate/	The third GOP presidential debate would have been a lot longer if it weren’t for Donald Trump, he said. In his closing remarks at the Oct. 28 debate, the real estate mogul touted his deal-making skills, saying he and fellow candidate Ben Carson negotiated with CNBC to cut the debate down to two hours instead of three. "We called in, we said, that’s it, we’re not doing it," Trump said. "They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn’t be done. Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three-and-a-half, including (CNBC). And in about two minutes, I renegotiated it down to two hours so we could get the hell out of here." Moderator John Harwood disagreed and said, "Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours." But Trump held his ground: "That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right." So is Trump right, or is Harwood? We found that Trump is embellishing his story. Three hours? CNBC first announced the debate Sept. 30, but the negotiations over logistics didn’t happen until mid October. A September press release said "candidates will take the stage at 8PM ET for two hours of debate." While this bolsters Harwood’s claim, this count didn’t include commercial time -- so there would be a certain amount of time for advertising on top of the two hours of actual debate. But CNBC never anticipated the whole program would last anywhere near three or more hours. CNBC said the total anticipated commercial time was just 15 minutes, so the whole program (pre-negotiations) would have lasted around two hours and 15 minutes. Two weeks later, some GOP candidates complained about the debate logistics -- notably that there would be no opening or closing remarks, according to news reports. The Trump and Carson campaigns went so far as to send a letter to CNBC’s Washington bureau, threatening to drop out if their demands weren’t met. "Mr. Trump and Carson do agree to a 120 minute debate that includes commercial breaks and opening and closing statements," the Oct. 15 letter reads. "Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson do not, and will not, agree to appear at a debate that is more than 120 minutes long including commercial breaks." The letter also indicates that Trump’s campaign was aware the program would last about two hours, even with commercials. "Specifically, we write because the agenda sent to the campaigns recently by CNBC in partnership with the Republican National Committee (RNC), and reiterated on yesterday’s call, indicated that there would be ‘two hours of debate time’ plus four commercial breaks lasting between two and four minutes each," the letter said. The next day, CNBC agreed to cap the program at 120 minutes and for candidates to have 30 seconds at the beginning and the end. We can’t speak to how much of a role Trump directly played in the negotiation. We asked spokespeople at CNBC and the Republican National Committee about this, but neither would talk on the record. However, it’s fair to infer that his threatening to drop out of the debate probably put some pressure on leadership with the RNC and CNBC. In any case, Trump and the Republicans didn’t negotiate down an hour and a half; they negotiated 15 minutes. So in saying "the debate was always going to be two hours," Harwood’s statement was closer to accurate than Trump’s. Our ruling Trump said the CNBC debate was supposed to be three hours, and he "renegotiated it down to two hours." Trump played a role -- but not the sole role -- in negotiating the debate program down to two hours, but the plans were for it to last around two hours and 15 minutes -- not three hours or more.

pomt-08438	"Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/18/nathan-deal/barnes-mexico-trip-sparks-new-round-attacks/	Editor's note: A response to the Oct. 1 U.S. Senate PolitiFact article can be found in Letters to the Editor With the economy and the impact of illegal immigration on the job market on the minds of many voters this political season, Republican nominee for governor Nathan Deal recently attempted to remind Georgians that he -- not Democrat Roy Barnes -- is on their side concerning these issues. The Deal campaign put together a 30-second ad that begins with Barnes discussing his goal of creating more jobs. "We need to take care of our own," Barnes says. "Hmm," a male voice says. "Sounds nice. But Roy Barnes proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia." Deal's proof is an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article from Nov. 8, 2001. The story detailed a meeting between Barnes, who was governor at the time, and then Mexican President Vicente Fox in Mexico City. Barnes is reported as saying that Georgia's experience with a fast-growing immigrant population has generally been beneficial. "The labor we have received, primarily Mexicans, has fueled our economy," Barnes said. He added: "We could not have had the Olympics in 1996 had it not been for that." The Barnes campaign called the Deal ad a distortion of Barnes' position on immigrants legally working in the United States. "Barnes praised 'immigration,' not illegal immigration, as having been 'beneficial' as it 'fueled our economy,' " the Barnes campaign said in a statement. "He urged President Bush to 'work [immigration] out' because 'governors can't control immigration policy.' " Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson countered that it is disingenuous for the Barnes campaign to accuse Deal's ad of stretching the truth here. Barnes was certainly aware that most immigrant workers were not here legally, Robinson said. "For him to imply otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test," Robinson said. "What percentage of that work force meets that criteria [of being in the U.S. legally]?" We took a look. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that in 2009, there were slightly more than 28,000 people in Georgia who were legal permanent residents or "green card" holders. The federal agency also tries to keep track of how many people are living illegally in the U.S. About 480,000 illegal immigrants were living in Georgia in 2009, according to Homeland Security estimates, and in 2000 the estimated total was 220,000. The Homeland Security report does not have a breakdown of what percentage of people living in Georgia illegally are from Mexico. Nationwide, Homeland Security estimates that 62 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Mexico. Applied to Georgia in 2000, that would be 136,400 illegal immigrants from Mexico. Presumably a large number of those were workers. Barnes was in Mexico in 2001 for a four-day trade mission. Mexico was Georgia's third-largest trading partner, and Georgia companies were exporting $1 billion in products to that nation. State officials estimated at the time that Latino-owned businesses in Georgia had about $1.3 billion a year in annual sales. Some of Georgia's business titans, such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, came on the trip. Barnes told a story in the 2001 AJC article about farmers in South Georgia, where he said "it's about as conservative as you can get," who wanted him to get health coverage for "migrant farmworkers." The governor noted the presidents of the United States and Mexico were discussing proposals for legalizing some undocumented Mexican workers. "Old ideas have changed," Barnes said. But since then attitudes toward illegal immigration have hardened, as highlighted by a poll that found 68 percent of Georgians support Arizona-type restrictions and enforcement of illegal immigration laws. And many politicians do not want to appear soft on the issue. Barnes said during a July debate that he would support an Arizona-type law in the Peach State to fight illegal immigration. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that has since gone before the courts that allows state and local law enforcement officers to ask people stopped for possible crimes to show proof they are in the United States legally. Deal's first television ad, in July, slammed President Barack Obama over illegal immigration, promised Georgia would soon have an Arizona-type law and said he doesn't care what "liberals" think. Robinson accused Barnes of running from his "liberal record" with his support of the Arizona legislation. "He is all over the board on this," Robinson said. Andra Gillespie, an assistant political science professor at Emory University, explained that Barnes is trying to cut into Deal's conservative base by taking a stand on illegal immigration that is seemingly popular with most Georgia voters. Gillespie said the Deal statement that Barnes "proclaimed Mexican workers good for Georgia" is misleading. "Nathan Deal's campaign knows very well that when Roy Barnes went to Mexico and praised the contributions of Mexican immigrants [presumably in a spirit of good will and diplomacy], he was not explicitly supporting illegal immigration," the professor said. "But because Barnes did not specify his support for legal immigrant workers, the Deal campaign is taking advantage of the ambiguity and trying to fill in the blanks for voters." We believe the Deal ad does accurately convey the quotes from Barnes in the 2001 AJC article. However, it's unclear that Barnes was talking specifically about illegal immigrants and, moreover, Barnes uttered the quotes nine years ago in a different political and economic climate. It doesn't necessarily follow that Barnes supports Mexican labor in Georgia today. So the ad lacks context that might give viewers a different impression. So by the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, the statement rates as Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-10-18T06:00:00	2010-10-12	['Mexico']
pomt-12372	Says Arabic "is the third most-common language in Austin."	false	/texas/statements/2017/jun/05/maram-museitif/city-austin-appointee-says-arabic-third-most-commo/	An Austin appointee declared Arabic the Texas capital’s third most-common language. De veras? Maram Museitif, confirmed by the Austin City Council in May 2017 to serve until 2020 on the Central Health Board of Managers, was quoted saying in a press release announcing the appointment: "I'm very familiar with Central Health's mission and the needs of the people we serve. I bring a broader representation to the board." Museitif went on: "Austin has a growing Muslim, Arab, and refugee community and they need a voice at the table. I can be that voice. I'm a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most-common language in Austin." That’s not so for all of Austin, we found, but it has been so among patients seeking care at clinics overseen by Central Health. For all of Texas, we previously found True a 2016 claim by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that Vietnamese is the state’s third most-spoken language. Cornyn’s statement was backed up by U.S. Census Bureau survey results. Those results placed Arabic about No. 10 in the state. Spokesman: Appointee meant to limit claim Ted Burton, a Central Health spokesman, responded to our request for the basis of Museitif’s statement by saying she meant to say something less. "Museitif," Burton wrote, "was referring to CommUnityCare’s patient population – meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves." He said the online press release quoting Museitif would be amended to quote her calling Arabic "the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population." Central Health says it works through a network of health care partners and community members to connect uninsured, underinsured and low-income residents with high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its all-volunteer board consists of four members appointed by the council, four by the Travis County Commissioners Court — plus one joint appointee Burton wrote that in fiscal 2015, a little over half of the entity’s patients spoke English, nearly 44 percent spoke Spanish--and, third in concentration, 1.1 percent reported speaking Arabic, according to self-reported patient data. In the year, Burton said, about 20 clinics served more than 88,000 patients. Burton provided a chart breaking out patients’ "language" responses: Top 10 Languages spoken by CUC patients, FY15 (excluding unknown or other) Language % 1 English 51.9% 2 Spanish 43.5% 3 Arabic 1.1% 4 Burmese 0.4% 5 Nepali 0.4% 6 Vietnamese 0.3% 7 Persian 0.2% 8 American Sign Language 0.2% 9 Swahili 0.1% 10 Amharic 0.1% Total 98.1% SOURCE: Email citing patient-submitted responses, Ted Burton, director of communications, Central Health, May 26, 2017 Burton, asked for more detail, emailed us a document showing that Arabic also proved to be CommUnityCare patients’ third most-common language in 2014 and 2016. Asked why Arabic has been so widely used among patients, Burton put us in touch with an Arabic-speaking CommUnityCare physician assistant, Amneh Amro, who speculated by phone that there’d been an Austin-area uptick in refugees from Arabic-speaking countries including Syria. A decade earlier, Amro said, Asian languages were likely more prevalent among patients. When we asked, Burton said Central Health has no data on patients' countries of origin. Surveys: Chinese third most-common Austin language So, which languages are most prevalent in Austin? We heard back from a couple of authorities on that. Jewel Jordan, a Census Bureau spokeswoman, pointed out results from the single-year 2015 American Community Survey indicating that behind English and Spanish, the third most common spoken language in Austin was Chinese. According to those survey results, Arabic was Austin’s 12th most-common spoken language — though we noticed that if you apply the survey’s margin of error figures as much as possible to drive up the number of Austin Arabic speakers and apply respective margins of error to drive down the number of speakers of some other languages, it’s possible to place Arabic fifth in the city, behind English, Spanish, Chinese and "Other Asian Languages." Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, drew on the bureau’s five-year ACS results through 2015 to provide a chart showing Arabic 10th in prevalence among spoken languages in Austin behind English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, other Asian languages, Korean, Hindi, French and other Indic languages. The chart also presents estimates of the number of individuals primarily speaking about 30 other languages. Our ruling Museitif called Arabic Austin’s third most-common language. That’s incorrect; in 2015, Chinese ranked third in prevalence in Austin behind English and Spanish, according to federal surveys. Arabic was evidently third most common among languages spoken by patients at clinics overseen by Central Health. We rate Museitif’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-09558	"The State of Texas does not even use the E-Verify system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/01/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-texas-state-doesnt-use-e-verify-wee/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican candidate for governor, is one of nearly 183,500 employers nationwide who have registered to use E-Verify. The federal electronic system is designed to prevent the hiring of illegal workers by letting employers run a prospective employee's name, date and Social Security number through government records. During the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate, she criticized the state for not using the online system to check its job applicants. "The State of Texas does not even use the E-Verify system to determine if someone is legally in our country when they apply for a job," she said. "If I'm governor of Texas, we will." During the second debate Friday, Hutchison called E-Verify the best system for employers to identify undocumented workers. Is Texas state government really not using the verification service singled out by Hutchison? If not, does that mean it isn't checking whether job applicants are legally living here? During Friday's debate, Gov. Rick Perry said: "E-Verify would not make a hill of beans' difference when it comes to what's happening in America today. You secure the border first, then you can talk about how to identify individuals in an immigration situation." Still, the state does screen prospective employees. Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: "We use I-9 forms in compliance with federal law." She was referring to the Employment Eligibilty I-9 form from the Department of Homeland Security which must be filled out by the employer and new employees to document that each employee — citizen and non-citizen alike — is authorized to work in the United States. Employers, who are required to keep filled-out forms on file for three years, are subject to penalties if they can't produce them upon request from federal agencies. Tyler Moran, policy director for the National Immigration Law center, which advocates for low-income immigrants, said the I-9 form, if completed in good faith, is an effective means of weeding out undocumented workers. Authorities say that by completing the form, employers demonstrate that they have examined relevant documents (such as a Social Security card) to check their workers' identities. That's how the State of Texas has certified new hires' legal residency since 1986, when a federal law prohibited employers from knowingly hiring residents who are not legally living in the United States. In 2007, Texas enacted legislation that further requires businesses that are applying for a grant or tax cut from a public agency to submit a statement certifying that they don't knowingly employ undocumented residents. But no law requires employers to verify the authenticity of their workers' documents. Undoubtedly, some undocumented immigrants use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to apply for jobs. The E-Verify system, which uses information from the I-9 form, was developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to prevent such fraud. About 183,500 entities use the program, including 9,700 of the roughly 380,600 private Texas employers including AT&T and the Houston Ballet. Except for an estimated 170,000 federal contractors, E-verify is still voluntary for an estimated 6 million employers. Since its inception in 2006, E-Verify has been used by Hutchison's office to screen 363 job applicants to her Washington and Texas offices, according to DHS spokeswoman Maria Elena Garcia Upson. But E-Verify isn't foolproof. It has incorrectly identified legal residents as undocumented workers and vice versa. According to the the Department of Homeland Security, which operates E-Verify with the Social Security Administration, 0.3 percent of workers — from the millions of queries employers have filed — have successfully contested instances when their documents didn't match E-Verify records. In 2002, Westat, a Washington research organization, evaluated E-Verify's pilot program at the request of the federal government. The group found that there were "serious problems with the timeliness and accuracy of the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) database." In March 2009, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress, found that while the program had improved, it was still flawed: "While... E-Verify can detect certain types of document fraud, it has limited ability to detect such fraud when the 'counterfeit documents are of reasonable quality and contain information about actual work-authorized persons.' Valid documents obtained by using fraudulent birth certificates or other so-called breeder documents may be even more difficult for E-Verify to detect." About a month later, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano (who'd earlier signed legislation making E-Verify mandatory in Arizona, where she was governor) touted the program as the best way to verify the legal residency of state government workers, "adjunct to enforcement of our immigration laws." Ten states require their state agencies to participate in E-Verify; three more — South Carolina, Arizona and Mississippi — require all employers to use it, too. In 2008, though, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour aired these misgivings: "I am concerned about mandating the E-Verify system as the sole source from which an employer in Mississippi can verify a potential employee’s eligibility, especially since the federal government itself has said E-Verify is not a reliable system." The bottom line: Texas uses the same method of checking legal residency that most states use. But Hutchison correctly said the state doesn't use E-Verify. We find her statement True.

pomt-00202	Dan McCready "did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/17/congressional-leadership-fund/attack-ad-distorts-mccreadys-position-tax-cuts/	There are few voting blocs as coveted as the proverbial middle class. Politicians often boast about how their economic strategies are good for the middle class. Or they’ll say their opponent’s tax plans are bad for the middle class. A new ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund goes a step further while making a claim about Dan McCready, the Democrat facing Republican Mark Harris in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. The ad, citing a recent Charlotte Observer editorial, criticizes McCready for dodging questions in a recent forum. The narrator then pivots. "But McCready did admit he opposes middle class tax cuts," the narrator says. As the narrator speaks, the ad displays an image of a story about McCready that McClatchy newspapers published on June 5. Does the article back up the claim that McCready said he opposes tax cuts for the middle class? Not really. McCready was referring to his overall opposition to the tax plan. In fact, McCready says in the story he opposes the tax plan because it didn’t do enough to help the middle class. "It took steps in the right direction, particularly in making American business more competitive," but "did not cut taxes enough for the middle class," McCready is quoted as saying. The Trump tax cuts Contacted by PolitiFact, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) noted that McCready opposed the tax plan approved by Republicans last year. Thus, the spokesman posited, McCready opposed tax cuts for the middle class. PolitiFact has written extensively about the tax plan, noting that most Americans will see cuts in the next few years. According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018. However, those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. The CLF claim is similar to one made recently by Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada. He claimed his opponent, Democrat Jacky Rosen, promised to "repeal (the) middle-class tax cut." Political groups like to paint opponents with a broad brush. Just because a candidate doesn’t support a bill doesn’t mean they oppose everything the bill does. McCready’s position McCready has repeatedly said he supports tax cuts for the middle class. He hopes to re-tool the Trump tax plan rather than repeal it, said Aaron Simpson, McCready’s deputy campaign manager. "The first thing Dan would have done differently is make sure the tax cuts to the middle class is permanent. In addition, he believes we should have focused more on small business tax relief and making it easier to raise a family," Simpson said in an email to PolitiFact. McCready stated that position on his Facebook page in December and in a debate with Harris on Oct. 10. He said he supports the tax cuts in the Trump tax bill. "But we needed to do much more of that: Give less of the tax cuts to the Warren Buffetts and Koch Brothers of the world and more to the hardworking teachers and firefighters that deserve a lot better here in North Carolina," McCready said. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says McCready admitted he opposes middle class tax cuts. They cited a story about the tax plan passed last year. In it, McCready specifically says the tax plan didn’t do enough to help the middle class. And McCready has repeatedly said he likes the middle class tax cuts in the Trump plan. We rate this claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-03483	Says Madison Mayor Paul Soglin's stated intent when proposing that city contractors disclose private political donations was to "discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/12/wisconsin-institute-law-liberty/wisconsin-institute-law-liberty-says-law-aims-disc/	Madison Mayor Paul Soglin wants to require city contractors to publicly disclose donations they’ve made to super PACS or advocacy groups operating in Wisconsin. That has drawn objections from a conservative public interest law firm, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty. It contends the liberal mayor’s proposed ordinance is unconstitutional and violates "a bedrock principle of our democracy that government cannot play favorites among citizens, including public contractors, based on their political beliefs." So why does Soglin want to mandate the public disclosures by firms doing business with the city? Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty offered this answer in a June 4, 2012 post on its website: The proposed ordinance, "according to Mayor Soglin, is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees." Is that what Soglin has said is a goal of the legislation? Asked to back up the group’s claim, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty president and general counsel Rick Esenberg pointed to a May 8, 2013 story in Madison’s Capital Times that quoted Soglin extensively about his motives. The article stated that actions by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that ran contrary to the wishes of Madison and Soglin were on the mayor’s mind when he drafted the ordinance. "Legislative action since Gov. Scott Walker’s election — including Act 10 in 2011 curtailing the collective bargaining power of most public workers, and more recently, legislation setting levy limits for municipalities and restricting cities’ powers in tenant-landlord law — got Soglin wondering if companies supporting Republican causes would rather lobby against the city or do business with it," the Cap Times story said. It added: "He’s betting that exposing such activities might prompt some companies to curtail them." Those passages suggest pretty strongly that Soglin believes that some contractors faced with being identified as pro-Republican or pro-conservative will reconsider their political activity under his proposal to require them to publicly report their now-private donations to advocacy groups. Deeper into the Capital Times interview, Soglin made another reference to the right side of the political spectrum. He mentioned the Koch Brothers, the billionaire industrialists who founded the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, a tea-party organization that supported Walker in his 2012 recall win. It’s unclear how much the group raises and spends because as a tax-exempt organization the group, like many others, does not have to disclose its donors. Soglin’s additional comments from the article: "I think it would be a good idea to know if the bidders are contributing to political efforts which go into organizations that may be lobbying for certain kinds of outcomes or working against the interests of the city. It is simply the idea that sunshine is good." "If a company bidding on a city contract also is lobbying for state or federal regulations that make their product required in their industry, the public ought to know about it. At the same time if they’re supplying the city while they're behaving like the Koch brothers, it would be good for the public to know it." "It’s a bit ironic when someone wants a contract with government, yet supports organizations that hate government and try to make it inefficient." So that is what is in the article. To be sure, the language of the proposed ordinance itself doesn’t say Soglin’s intent is to squelch donations. It says information on donations is "essential to the operation of a democracy, informing voters and governments about the activities of those attempting to influence the operations of government." Indeed, the proposal would require disclosure of donations to groups of any political stripe -- it does not single out conservatives or Republicans. Rather, the ordinance specifies that firms and minority owners disclose donations made to tax-exempt 501(c)(4) advocacy or "super PAC" organizations operating in Wisconsin the prior two years. Contractors would face a one-year ban from receiving city contracts if they fail to disclose any donations to advocacy groups within 30 days of getting a contract. When we reached Soglin, he acknowledged the ordinance might cause some firms hoping to continue as city contractors to stop making donations to groups that oppose the views of he and other city leaders. "I will not say that this will leave things exactly the way things are," he said. But Soglin added this: He said the contractors were free to exercise their First Amendment rights and that he hopes they continue to make such donations, saying, "I want to know where they stand." He said his goal was to unmask donations, for example, by firms whose ownersmake private donations to advocacy groups working to unseat sitting aldermen. Or to identify firm officials who give to groups supporting private-school vouchers and other programs and decisions he and city officials have opposed. "I think the public has a right to know," said Soglin. What would happen if left-leaning city officials discover that contractors are fighting the views of city officials in private? Soglin said no city officials will take into account political donations when officials are deciding on awarding a contract. That language is also included in the ordinance. But Scott Resnick, the Madison Common Council’s president pro tem, told us in an interview that aldermen would, in fact, use the information on donations made to groups supporting Republicans in state government when evaluating whether firms should be rewarded future city contracts. "So we want to know if you were putting money towards that before we sign another contract with you," he said. "This would be one more data set that will be used to make decisions" on awarding contracts. In the view of Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty’s Esenberg, the ordinance’s statement that political activity would not be held against firms at contract time shows the provision has no legitimate government purpose. "Curiosity is not a valid governmental purpose, nor is the exposure of private contributions to the public for use by you or others in the political arena," Esenberg wrote to Soglin on June 3, 2013. Soglin, Esenberg said, leaves the listener no other choice but to think that he favors an outcome in which contractors curtail their political activity. "He wants to out these people as conservatives or libertarians, and they won’t want to be outed that way in Madison," Esenberg said. Our rating The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty contended that, according to Soglin himself, the proposed ordinance "is intended to discourage contributions to organizations with which he disagrees." The group cites a newspaper interview that paraphrased Soglin saying that could happen in some cases as a result of his legislation. Soglin told us the same thing, but said his goal was limited to transparency. His statements make pretty clear he looks forward to forcing contractors to choose between trimming their political activity or disclosing it and facing the consequences. And he predicts some will stop making donations. We rate the statement True.	None	Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty	None	None	None	2013-06-12T09:00:00	2013-06-04	['None']
pomt-08042	"We're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/04/mike-polensek/cleveland-councilman-mike-polensek-rails-sewage-tr/	Industrial pollution made national news and made Cleveland the butt of jokes in 1969 after the Cuyahoga River caught fire -- not for the first time -- and did $50,000 damage to bridges. The fire helped focus attention on environmental problems and contributed to passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Water pollution from sanitary sewer and storm runoff has had a lower profile. But the issue has been important to Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek "for more years than I care to recall," he says. There are almost two miles of lakefront in his ward and a good portion of that is public beach. Polensek spoke at a meeting of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District in November to support its $3 billion settlement with EPA that could triple sewer rates in Cleveland and about 60 suburbs, but will pay for mandated construction work to deal with combined sanitary and storm sewer overflows. "Let's face it, this is the year 2010 and we're worse than a Third World country in terms of water quality and the way we treat our sewage," Polensek told sewer district trustees. "What we're paying for now is really an indictment of the 40-year delay in living up to the Clean Water Act." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look to see if there is any truth to his comparison. Polensek is notably outspoken, and "Third World" sounded like dramatic hyperbole. But the councilman told PolitiFact Ohio he was not exaggerating and would not water down his remarks. "It's outrageous in America in 2010 that we have tributaries as polluted as the Tigris and Euphrates," he said. "It's unconscionable when you see the filth that comes down that creek after a rainstorm. We have the technology to prevent it. What we haven't got is elected officials with the (guts) to make the tough decisions. They have deferred and deferred and passed the proverbial bleeping buck. You pay now or pay later." Two side-by-side beaches, Euclid Beach and Villa Angela, are a particular concern. Both are close to Euclid Creek, which drains a 24-square-mile section of eastern Cuyahoga County into Lake Erie. Both beaches were too unhealthy for swimming on 48 percent of the days last summer, according to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District. From May 2 to Sept. 6, average bacterial levels sampled daily exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's maximum E. coli standard by 40 percent. (The standard is a density of 235 parts per 100 ml of water, indicating the presence of human or animal waste that could make swimmers sick.) "It should be a national embarrassment," Polensek said. "It's a sin that we have those types of bacterial levels." He sees improving Great Lakes water quality as an economic development issue and a strategic defense issue, because "We don't have to worry about trying to get water across a border." He is angriest about health issues. "Where do they think our drinking water comes from?" he asked, noting he's had complaints about respiratory, eye and ear infections blamed on contact with lake water. Women have reported vaginal infections, he said. PolitiFact Ohio found support for Polensek's anger. The National Resources Defense Council found Cleveland the worst urban area on the Great Lakes in bacterial samples, with the highest risk of gastrointestinal illness on Great Lakes beaches. East Side beaches get 55 percent of the nearly 5 billion gallons of raw sewage dumped into the lake in Greater Cleveland per year. Euclid Creek is the most polluted tributary in the region. But is it Third World? "Third World" once designated countries not aligned politically with the West or the East. Now it generally refers to underdeveloped and developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, but it has no single definition. "There is no established convention for the designation of 'developed' and 'developing' countries or areas in the United Nations system," says the UN Statistics Division. "An estimated 90 percent of all wastewater in developing countries is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans," according to the United Nations Environment Programme, but we could find no benchmark characterizing recreational or bathing water of developing nations or "Third World" quality. We turned for perspective to an expert not involved in local politics or government: scientist Sandra L. McLellan of the Great Lakes Water Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Her specialty is environmental toxicology, and her laboratory's major focus is investigating connections between environmental processes and human health. Her current projects involve sewage pollution in rivers and at beaches. She did not dispute Polensek, though she preferred more careful wording. "I think the accurate statement would be that during the time of a combined sewage overflow we're no better than a developing country," she said. She found it particularly startling and significant that the regional sewer district reports more than 80 sewage overflows in a typical season on just the East Side beaches near Euclid Creek. "It's a pretty bad situation and not up to what other cities have done," McLellan said. "That's like the 1970s or '80s for most cities. They should have only two or three (overflows) a year." In Milwaukee, she said, construction in 1993 of a deep tunnel system reduced overflows from 50-60 per year to 2.5. That's also the specific goal of the Euclid Creek Tunnel, the first part of the sewer district's Project Clean Lake, on which construction will begin in March. The bottom line, she said, is what happens during overflows: "It's a completely open sewer going directly to the rivers and streams. It is like Third World." So where does that leave Polensek’s statement? While the region does not meet the discharge levels estimated for developing countries -- that 90 percent of all wastewater is discharged untreated directly into rivers, lakes or the oceans -- it is clear that pollution levels are high. Bacterial counts at two beaches in Polensek’s ward exceeded save levels for nearly half the days during the summer and Cleveland’s beaches were rated worst among urban centers in the Great Lakes. And an expert on environmental toxicology agrees that when there are overflows from the sewage system -- something that impacts those beaches an average of more than 80 times a season -- it would be like "Third World," with an open sewer flowing directly into rivers and streams So we find Polensek’s statement has some elements of truth, but that also you need to know some important details to completely evaluate its accuracy. On the Truth-O-Meter that scores a rating of Half True.	None	Mike Polensek	None	None	None	2011-01-04T06:00:00	2010-11-18	['None']

pomt-00619	"Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA" in its bond rating.	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-was-only-state-get-aaa-bond-/	Not-quite-yet Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush continues to sell potential voters on his eight years as Florida’s governor. "Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating)," Bush told business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015. He added the change followed years of increasing the state’s cash reserves from $1 billion to $10 billion. A state getting its bond rating upgraded is a relatively rare occurrence, so we wondered whether Florida was the only state to jump to a top rating while Bush was in office from 1999-2006. Getting an upgrade For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts. This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Each reports their ratings differently, but Bush’s Right to Rise political action committee spokesman Matt Gorman told us he was referring specifically to the S&P analysis. Gorman shared a Pew Charitable Trusts infographic that showed "S&P state credit ratings" from 2001 to 2014. The infographic shows that Florida was the only state between 2001 and 2006 to make the ratings leap Bush specified (AA to AAA). On Feb. 25, 2005, S&P upgraded Florida’s general obligation bond rating from AA+ (which is slightly higher than their AA rating, actually) to AAA. The difference is in rating the state’s capacity to meet its debt obligations from "very strong" to "extremely strong," according to agency guidelines. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also upgraded the state that year, but their ratings are designated differently. S&P’s report on the upgrade said the decision was "based on the state's strong and conservative financial and budget management practices, coupled with substantial budget reserves and economic trends that have been among the strongest nationally." The report also cited stable state revenue, a moderate debt burden and a service-based economy that was growing faster than the national average as among other reasons for the upgrade. S&P’s analysis said Florida’s outlook was stable due to "the state's strong budget reserves and demonstrated track record of active budget management and long-term planning and forecasting." Bush wants to take credit for this budget management, and he could lay some claim to the idea. He was well-known during his tenure for regularly using the line-item veto to discard hundreds of millions in spending on budgeted projects Bush deemed wasteful or that didn’t follow his agenda. Taking the red pen to the Legislature’s final budgets helped build the state’s cash reserves from $1.3 billion to $9.8 billion by 2006, so Bush’s numbers there are pretty accurate. The Legislature actively socked cash away in state coffers during this time. So, yes, Florida was the only state to make the jump looking at data between 2001 and 2014. But there’s one problem: Bush became governor in 1999. Those two years make a big difference. We asked S&P for its history of state ratings and found two instances that counter Bush’s claim: On Feb. 22, 2000, S&P upgraded Delaware from AA+ to AAA. On Sept. 27, 2000, the agency did the same for Michigan. (It was downgraded back to AA+ in 2003.) Florida, for the record, still enjoys the AAA rating it earned in 2005, with an outlook S&P now considers stable. Our ruling Bush said, "Florida was the only state during my eight years to go from AA to AAA (in its bond rating)." Florida’s general obligation bond rating was upgraded by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services in 2005. But both Delaware and Michigan were upgraded from AA+ to AAA by the S&P in 2000, which was during Bush’s second year in office. The information Bush’s PAC cited did not include his first two years in office. We rate his statement False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-05-28T10:00:00	2015-05-20	['None']

pomt-04784	Says Betty Sutton and House Democrats "gutted" Medicare by $741 billion to pay for Obamacare.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/24/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-democrats-gutted-med/	Mitt Romney rekindled a heated debate over Medicare by picking U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate. Ryan, head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, is the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare, which today operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Democratic congressional candidates are making the protection of traditional Medicare a centerpiece of their campaigns. The Republican response has been to attack back. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are "gutting $741 billion from Medicare" to pay for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One of those 37 Democrats was Rep. Betty Sutton. GOP Rep. Jim Renacci, her opponent in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district, repeated the claim the next day in a campaign fundraising email. "We all know that our seniors were slapped with an estimated $500 billion blow to Medicare in 2010 when President Obama and Betty Sutton pushed through their healthcare law, which ended Medicare as we know it," the message said. "Now, revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund ObamaCare." PolitiFact Ohio was interested. We have examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions. The most recent was last May, when Renacci's campaign website said Sutton "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" to fund Obamacare. We rated that statement Mostly False. How did the claim climb from $500 billion to $741 billion? Renacci's email said: "Revised estimates by the Congressional Budget Office reveal Democrats gutted even more from Medicare than we first knew, taking $741 billion from seniors to fund Obamacare." We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement. Except for the revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, the backup matched the sourcing for the earlier claim with $500 billion. Let's review, with the revised estimate. First, Obamacare does not literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, spending will grow. But the health care law instituted a number of changes to slow the program’s future spending growth and try to contain future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those savings amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So savings in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors. The efforts to limit future growth were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant changes to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the figure for the savings also increases. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has risen past $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion. The $741 billion cited by the RNCC and Renacci includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs. So it is timing that's making the figures bigger, not changes to Medicare. The claim that Democrats support "gutting" Medicare is wrong -- program spending will still increase under Obamacare, but at a slower pace. There is an element of truth in Renacci’s claim. The health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion. But describing those savings as cuts that gut Medicare suggests a slashing of programs that is not in the law. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-10334	McCain has switched to Obama's position on more troops to Afghanistan.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/22/barack-obama/ground-conditions-have-changed-too/	Sen. John McCain has praised the surge in Iraq for bringing greater stability to the region, and has reminded voters that he long supported it. But while Iraq was stabilizing, the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating. So on July 15, 2008, the McCain campaign released "a new comprehensive strategy for victory in Afghanistan" that applies "the tried and true principles of counterinsurgency used in the Iraq surge." His new policy includes sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan. "Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available," states the campaign's strategy outline. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pounced on this news. By the end of the week, spokesman Bill Burton had sent out a memo titled, "Obama leading on foreign policy, McCain following." "This past week, Senator McCain changed his position for political reasons, embracing Obama's call for more troops the day after Obama restated it in a New York Times op-ed, and almost one year after Obama's initial plan," Burton wrote. We reviewed the candidates' past statements to determine whether McCain has changed position to match Obama. Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will," Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings here , here and here. ) But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan. "Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve," Obama said. "As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban." In the months that followed, Obama repeatedly emphasized his assertion that the United States "had taken our eye off the ball" by invading Iraq instead of concentrating on Afghanistan. McCain, meanwhile, has rebutted Obama by saying that Iraq is and should be the central front on the war on terror. We couldn't find examples of McCain specifically rejecting Obama's proposal to send more troops to Afghanistan. Neither could we find examples of him supporting more brigades in Afghanistan, which likely would raise logistical questions about whether there were enough troops for a surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather, when it came to Afghanistan, McCain emphasized the need for NATO countries to do their part, and for the United States and NATO forces to better manage troop levels and logistics. As recently as July 8, 2008, McCain emphasized these points. During an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, McCain talked at length about NATO, saying only that it was possible the United States might have to add more troops, but not specifically endorsing that position. Here's the exchange: Question: "Senator, you had called the situation in Afghanistan tough and you said that any failure there could lead — could have dire consequences for the NATO alliance. Beyond Pakistan, what do you think it takes for the U.S. to succeed there? Is more troops the answer?" McCain: "I think there is a whole lot of challenges that we face. One of them is whether we succeed or not in Iraq. I think that has a direct impact on the region. But I also believe that the Karzai government being more effective, the Pakistan situation as you and I discussed, the economic progress, again this is one of these situations where you've got to maintain the security environment, but then you've got to have the progress where people will have a better life to look forward to. And one of the failures, because of corruption, has been that we haven't made the progress economically in some of these parts of Iraq and we had this window of opportunity and it wasn't as well used as perhaps it could have. But again, I can't tell you that there's one solution to it with the struggle military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, it's all of one and yet it has various aspects. And I just finally would say, and I'm sorry for some wrong answers, but we are in this with other nations. That's important. And I'm glad that Sarkozy is sending additional French troops over there. I'm glad that many of our allies, I wish more of them and I wish the rules of engagement for some of them were better and a lot of things. But the fact is this is a — this is a lot of nations that are in this in a common interest." Question: "Do you think more troops should — do you think — some of the military have called for more additional troops ..." McCain: "I think yes, and I'd love to see our allies to contribute more in a broad variety of ways. I'd love to see that. And we may have to send additional troops. As you know, they just extended the Marine unit there by an additional 30 days. And I think they had — they did that very reluctantly." A week later, McCain would specifically advocate sending three more brigades to Afghanistan. One point McCain has made again and again on the campaign trail is that, when it comes to foreign policy, he bases his opinions on "conditions on the ground." His new policy on Afghanistan can fairly be interpreted as a reaction to those conditions, which have demonstrably worsened in the weeks before his announcement. The Obama campaign has said that McCain has changed position on Afghanistan for political reasons, to follow Obama. We are not ruling on McCain's motivation here; the McCain campaign can just as easily argue that McCain has changed position because circumstances have changed. From a political standpoint, it's certainly inconvenient when "conditions on the ground" dictate you dropping your position for your opponent's. Be all that as it may, Obama advocated more troops for Afghanistan about a year ago. McCain only recently embraced the same position. We rule this claim is True.

pomt-09740	The Baucus health care bill "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/15/save-flexible-spending-plans/flexible-spending-accounts-under-health-care-refor/	As Congress considers a sweeping health care reform bill, groups are springing up that represent obscure aspects of the current system. The latest group raising concerns represents companies that provide flexible spending accounts. The group, known as Save Flexible Spending Plans, sent us a press release with the dire warning that a proposal approved by the Senate Finance Committee "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform." "FSAs are a lifeline for working Americans, often making the difference between staying afloat and going into debt over health care needs, and sometimes between getting necessary treatment and avoiding it altogether because of the cost," said Joe Jackson, the organization's chairman and CEO of the benefits company WageWorks. To be clear, the group represents companies that would lose out if FSAs went away. We're examining the group's claim about the impact of the health care bill authored by Sen. Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Finance Committee. For the uninitiated, flexible spending accounts are benefits that some employers offer. Here's how they work: You agree to send a portion of your paycheck to a flexible spending account that can be used for health care costs. You get those dollars tax-free, so you save money by avoiding Uncle Sam's taxes. The accounts have several restrictions. Employers can limit how much money you can save; typical limits are anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 (though some employers set no limit). You have to save all your receipts and submit them to an administrator in most cases. And if you have any money in the account at the end of the year, your employer gets to keep it. Because of the use-it-or-lose-it provision, people tend to use these accounts for predictable health expenses, not emergencies. People who have the plans find them a good way to pay for co-pays, dental care, or special procedures that can be scheduled to match their contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also benefit significantly. Policymakers tend to dislike flexible spending accounts. According to this view, they unnecessarily complicate the tax code, and the use-it-or-lose-it provision encourages people to spend money on health care they don't really need. Because income taxes are progressive, the benefits of saving in an FSA go to higher earners and are negligible for people with low income. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning public-policy think tank, published a paper in June saying that health care reform should curtail flexible spending accounts . That would increase tax revenues to the federal government, which could be used to pay for subsidies for the uninsured. "The average FSA benefit is a few hundred bucks," said Chuck Marr, the center's director of federal tax policy. He said that's small potatoes and that Congress should focus more a sweeping reform bill. "In a world where resources are limited, this bill is trying to give coverage to people who don't have any." We checked Baucus' bill, which passed the committee on Tuesday. It does limit flexible spending accounts to $2,500 a year. It does not index them for inflation, which means that $2,500 will have less buying power as the years go by. Getting back to our statement, the organization Save Flexible Spending Plans said the Senate Finance Committee "would drastically restrict the use of flexible spending accounts (FSAs) in order to help pay for health care reform." Yes, it would restrict them, but even Save Flexible Spending Plans says the new restriction would affect only "one in five" beneficiaries. So this means by the group's own accounting that 80 percent of the people with FSAs would not be affected. That hardly seems drastic. We rate the group's statement Half True.

pomt-13765	"While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-had-biggest-tax-cuts-any-2016/	During this acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump contrasted his stance on tax policy with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton. "While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican," Trump said. We’ll analyze both parts of this statement in order. Clinton’s tax increase Clinton does propose an increase in taxes, though it’s a stretch to call it massive The Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank, estimates that most Americans won’t be affected by Clinton’s proposed tax hikes because they are targeted at the highest earners. She would create a 4 percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million and impose a 30 percent minimum rate on adjusted gross incomes above $1 million; She would also limit itemized deduction benefits at 28 percent; raise rates on medium-term capital gains to between 27.8 percent and 47.4 percent; increase the top estate tax rate to 45 percent and reduce the threshold to $3.5 million; and limit the value of tax-deferred retirement accounts. These changes would fall most heavily on the richest taxpayers, and for them, the hit would indeed be substantial. For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $2,673, or reduction of a bit less than 1 percent in after-tax income. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the increases would average $78,000, which is equal to a 5 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the top one-tenth of 1 percent -- who earn $3.7 million or above -- the extra tax bite would be $520,000, or a 7.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For the other 95 percent of taxpayers, the hit is relatively minor. Middle-income households would pay about $44 more on average, and the poorest filers would lose an additional $4. All told, Clinton’s plan would increase revenues collected by $1.1 trillion over 10 years, according to modeling by the Tax Policy Center. "That’s roughly a 2.5 percent increase in projected revenue for the decade," said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow. Williams acknowledged that the question of whether this counts as "massive" is a subjective question. Still, he said, "not in my book." Richard Borean, communications director of the more conservative Tax Foundation, concurred that the question is a subjective one. He did add that Clinton’s plan is far more modest than the one offered by her former rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders. Sanders’ proposed revenue increase, according to the Tax Foundation’s own modeling, is more than 20 times bigger than Clinton’s. Trump’s tax cuts Trump is on solid ground with the second half of his statement. He would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also Increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. The Tax Policy Center found that Trump’s plan would reduce revenues by the most of any candidate it analyzed. Revenues under Trump’s plan would fall by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, compared to $8.6 trillion under Ted Cruz’s plan and $6.8 trillion under Marco Rubio’s plan. (The center did not analyze the plans of several Republican candidates -- including John Kasich, Chris Christie and Ben Carson -- for a variety of reasons.) The Tax Foundation’s analyses agreed. "Trump’s plan is, in fact, the largest tax cut proposed by any candidate," Borean said. "His plan would reduce revenue by $10.14 trillion over 10 years after accounting for the impact on the economy, or $11.98 without." We’ll note, however, that economists are skeptical that Trump’s tax cuts would be sustainable, since they would require either massive cuts to discretionary federal spending or an explosion of new debt. "He says economic growth and cuts would make up for that, but it’s hard to imagine that it would be possible to do so," Williams said. Our ruling Trump said, "While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for president this year, Democrat or Republican." Clinton is indeed proposing a tax increase, though it can be described as "massive" for only the richest Americans. Meanwhile, Trump is correct that his tax cuts were the biggest of any 2016 candidate.

pomt-03288	Rick Scott "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/02/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-increased-tuition-our-state-colleges-an/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who grew up with working-class parents, paid for college by working at a doughnut shop he bought with a friend and with help from the G.I. Bill. Now a millionaire and a former hospital executive facing re-election next year, Scott has tried to channel the pain of Florida families trying to pay for college. In April, he vetoed the Legislature’s 3 percent tuition hike. "It’s ridiculous how much tuition has gone up in the past five years," Scott said. "Families are struggling." Is wealthy Scott now the savior of the ramen-noodle eating, penny-pinching college crowd? Not so fast, says the Florida Democratic Party. Don’t forget about the first two legislative sessions under Scott. In July, the Democrats unveiled a new website www.realrickscott.com. (Ads for the site have appeared on PolitiFact Florida.) The attack website accuses Scott of trying to hide his "real record," including that he "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits." We decided to do our homework on how higher education tuition has changed under Scott. The complicated way tuition is set First, here's some background about tuition. The Legislature sets base tuition. If there is no base tuition increase provided in the state budget, tuition goes up by the rate of inflation. Individual universities can ask the Florida Board of Governors for an extra increase known as the "tuition differential." Together, the base tuition and tuition differential can add up to no more than a 15 percent increase. Technically, it’s the Board of Governors, not Scott, that gets to vote on a tuition differential increase. But Scott appoints that board, and he has asked their opinions about tuition raises in interviews. Florida has 11 existing universities -- a new one, Florida Polytechnic, will start enrolling students in 2014. Florida also has 28 state colleges and community colleges. Those schools don’t need permission from the Board of Governors. Instead, the individual boards of state can generally approve tuition increases. Scott's actions on tuition Here we will focus on the part of tuition that Scott clearly has power over: the base tuition increase. Under Scott’s first approved budget in 2011, the base tuition for universities increased by 8 percent -- the same as the preceding two years under Gov. Charlie Crist. For state colleges, the increase was also 8 percent. In 2012, Scott vetoed a bill that would have allowed the University of Florida and Florida State University unlimited flexibility to raise tuition. The Legislature did not grant any base tuition increase for universities that year, but it structured the budget in such a way that universities were expected to seek that 15 percent tuition differential, the Tampa Bay Times reported. (In reality, those increases were all over the map.) For state colleges (again, separate from state universities), the budget included a 5 percent tuition increase. So Scott didn’t have to sign a budget with a tuition hike -- even though schools received tuition increases that year from the Board of Governors. The Democrats arrive at their double-digit figure by adding the 8 percent in Scott’s first year to the 5 percent in Scott’s second year. But that 5 percent only applied to state colleges -- not universities. We asked the Florida Democratic Party why they included colleges and universities in the claim. Spokesman Joshua Karp noted that two other pages on their attack website specified "college tuition" only -- for example stating "hiking college tuition by double digits." "The distinction between colleges and universities is something very few papers make," he said. (Karp sent us a few articles in major newspapers that didn’t make it clear that the 5 percent only referred to colleges.) John Holdnak, chief financial and budget officer for the Florida College System, said he would not call the 8 percent increase one year followed by the 5 percent increase the second year a double-digit increase. "The annual tuition growth is less than double digits," he said. (One page of the Democrats’ website specifies that the 13 percent is over two years.) Holdnak gave us this example: an employee who gets a 3 percent raise one year, a 3 percent the next year and a 4 percent raise the third year would not say he received a 10 percent raise. This year, Scott vetoed the 3 percent tuition increase and encouraged universities to forgo the 1.7 percent automatic increase -- a few schools found a way to offset that hike, for example by decreasing fees. Scott isn’t to blame for a law that requires the automatic increase. It’s worth noting that despite increases, Florida’s tuition remains among the lowest in the country. Tuition has risen largely in response to the drop-off in state funding. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott "increased tuition at our state colleges and universities by double digits." Democrats point to the base tuition increases of 8 percent in Scott’s first budget year and 5 percent in his second year. The state colleges did have those increases, but the universities only had the 8 percent hike -- not the 5 percent the next year. That line also didn’t specify a time period: that increase is over two years, not one. More recently, Scott has opposed additional tuition increases. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00229	Says Tom Hanks was photographed wearing a T-shirt with an anti-Trump message that begins, "I was going to be a Trump voter for Halloween but…"	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/10/blog-posting/no-tom-hanks-did-not-wear-t-shirt-bearing-vulgar-a/	A-list celebrity Tom Hanks has not held his cards close to his vest when it comes to his political views. He twice endorsed Barack Obama for president, spoke out against Donald Trump when a recording of then-presidential candidate’s lewd comments about grabbing women was made public and is among the celebrities standing with the "When We All Vote" voter-registration campaign launched by former first lady Michelle Obama. But in a recent post shared more than 70,000 times on Facebook, Hanks is falsely depicted wearing a white T-shirt that reads, "I was going to be a Trump voter for Halloween but my head wouldn’t fit up my a--." This viral photo was flagged by PolitiFact as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

pomt-12031	"Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes in the presidential election."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/15/kris-kobach/there-evidence-voter-fraud-new-hampshire-kris-koba/	Kris Kobach, the Kansas Secretary of State and Vice Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, has alleged voter fraud in the New Hampshire 2016 election. But his evidence is circumstantial at best. Kobach penned a Breitbart column on Sept. 7, 2017, claiming that 5,313 fraudulent votes likely altered the results of the Senate race between Democrat Maggie Hassan and Republican Kelly Ayotte and the presidential general election. Hassan won her race by 1,017 votes, and Clinton won the state over President Donald Trump by 2,732 votes. "Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on Nov. 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election," Kobach wrote. Kobach repeated his point in Manchester, N.H., on Sept. 12, 2017, during the second meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which Trump formed to analyze vulnerabilities in the voting system after his widely debunked claim that millions of illegal voters participated in the election. Kobach didn’t respond to our request for comment but Kobach’s spokeswoman, Samantha Poetter, said he stood by his column after the meeting. "About 5,300 (voters) as of 10 months (after voting) still had not obtained a New Hampshire’s driver’s license, which is required of residents 60 days after moving to the state, nor had they registered a vehicle in the state of New Hampshire," Kobach said. "So this obviously is a subject of concern because there have often been anecdotal reports of people driving into New Hampshire because it’s a same day registration state and voting because it’s a battleground state." Kobach also said that unlike his state of Kansas, New Hampshire has people "flooding across the border to possibly cast a vote." Trump and his Cabinet have repeated baseless claims that thousands of Massachusetts residents "brought in on buses" voted illegally in New Hampshire, which we originally rated Pants on Fire. Do we have reason to doubt New Hampshire’s general election results? Again, not really. "The problem that has occurred because of what you wrote is that the question of whether our election as we have recorded is real, and valid," said New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who is a fellow member of the panel co-chaired by Kobach. "And it is real and valid." Gardner said that the facts laid out by Kobach don’t create proof for the accusation of voter fraud. He pointed out that in the column, as well as in his speech, Kobach had fudged the line between domicile and residency, which is crucial in understanding New Hampshire voting law. A state Supreme Court decision determined that a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. In other words, it’s not necessary for the 5,313 voters in question to have become residents in order for their votes to be valid. That’s because eligible voters can be domiciled in the state without having to be residents — something Gardner acknowledged has caused confusion, even among polling officials. Domicile is defined as the place where a person sleeps, more than any other place, most nights of the year, or where they intend to return after a temporary time away. "The basic difference between a ‘resident’ and a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile,’ is that a ‘resident’ has manifested an intent to remain in New Hampshire for the indefinite future, while a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile’ has not manifested the same intent," Gardner wrote. College voters Kobach said that residents must obtain a New Hampshire’s driver’s license or register a vehicle in the state 60 days after moving, but that’s limited to drivers of motor vehicles. As multiple articles pointed out, college students are typical examples of people who would drive in another state without establishing residency in New Hampshire. New Hampshire Public Radio’s analysis of out-of-state IDs used to vote in November found that "the towns that see the highest rates of out-of-state IDs used at the polls are all home to college campuses." Kobach was unconvinced. "Being enrolled in a college does not free you from the legal obligation to become domiciled," Kobach said in his testimony. But that’s misleading, as becoming domiciled isn’t as complicated as he makes it sound. A voter can prove domicile using a New Hampshire driver’s license, a vehicle registration in the state, or a non-driver ID or other government issued photo identification that lists a New Hampshire address. But in some towns, providing a form issued by a New Hampshire college or university is sufficient to prove domicile. In Manchester, a voter can prove domicile by presenting a monthly bill, a medical bill, pay stubs showing a current address, or postmarked mail within the last 30 days. Other towns accept similar documentation. Otherwise, voters can simply sign an affidavit attesting they live there. In the case of affidavits, the state mails a letter to the listed address and if undeliverable or ignored, the case gets forwarded to the attorney general’s office for review. The other aspect of New Hampshire law that lends to the confusion is that alongside 15 other states, it has a same-day voter registration policy. "The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote," Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, told PolitiFact in February. "Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high." According to the New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety, 196 people are being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state — but even that isn’t proof that they did. How people voted "Until further research is done and until you make the next cut to find out how many are non-domiciled and then the final cut to actually determine how they voted, we will never know the answer regarding the legitimacy of that election," Kobach said in the panel. But Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, another member of the committee who affirmed New Hampshire’s voting integrity, said Kobach’s need to find out how voters cast their ballot was unnecessary in determining fraud, as fraudulent votes don’t necessarily equal votes against the Republican candidates. "We shouldn’t know how they voted," Dunlap said. "There’s a secret ballot, and it protects the voter." Dunlap also said Kobach was conflating fraud with the oft-contested New Hampshire voting statute that allows non-residents to vote. Kobach expressed his support for New Hampshire's Republican-backed SB 3, a recent law that calls on those registering to vote within 30 days of an election to provide documents that show they live where they are voting. A judge blocked the law's penalties. Our ruling Kobach said, "Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four Electoral College votes in the presidential election." He cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs, but New Hampshire law says there’s nothing inherently fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. As of yet, there is no evidence proving fraud, or that fraudulent votes pivoted the election against Trump and Ayotte. We rate this statement False.

pomt-13064	Obamacare "is not a popular law."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/17/paul-ryan/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-threatening-repeal-and-/	From Donald Trump to Paul Ryan to Ron Johnson, "repeal and replace" has been the mantra of national Republicans almost since Obamacare became law in 2010. With Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the White House, of course, the Affordable Care Act wasn’t going anywhere. But now, with the GOP not only in control of Congress but having won the presidency, Obamacare is in jeopardy -- even if repeal isn’t necessarily easy and the replacement not entirely clear. During the campaign, Trump pledged to ask Congress to repeal the law the first day he takes office in January 2017. But in recent days, he has indicated a willingness to perhaps amend the law, rather than repeal and replace it. So, where does the rest of the country stand on Obamacare? On Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump defeated Clinton and Ryan and Johnson were re-elected, Ryan held a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wis. Asked about repealing and replacing, the House speaker reaffirmed that that is his aim, and he made this declaration: "This health care law is not a popular law." Is he right? For the most part, yes. When Americans are asked about the Affordable Care Act, more generally disapprove than approve of it. That’s true in the latest polling and in surveys done throughout 2016. But there is more to consider in the numbers. Overall popularity To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited a Politico/Harvard poll of likely voters from late-September 2016. We found two more-recent polls, takne in late-October 2016 of registered voters, that found similar results. Politico/Harvard poll How well is the Affordable Care Act working? Very poorly/Somewhat poorly: 54% Very well/Somewhat well: 43% New York Times/CBS News poll Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 54% Approve: 39% Pew Research Center poll: Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 53% Approve: 45% Averaging the 16 national polls taken throughout 2016 that have asked about Obamacare produces similar results, according to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School poll: 47 percent said they have an unfavorable opinion or disapprove of it, while 41 percent said favorable or approve. So, it’s fair to say that if the question is about Obamacare overall, more Americans have a negative view than a positive one. At the same time, it’s not clear that Americans want repeal. When Pew asked what Congress should do with the law, 51 percent said expand (40 percent) the law or leave it as is (11 percent), while 45 percent said repeal it. And the picture changes a bit if you go deeper, particularly with polls done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data that has surveyed on Obamacare since 2010. Other views In Kaiser’s mid-October 2016 poll, 45 percent of adults said they had a favorable opinion and 45 percent said unfavorable. That tie reflects the partisan divide in the country. "Everything that you hear from the public about the ACA is seen through a partisan lens," said Mollyann Brodie, Kaiser’s head public opinion and survey research, referring to Kaiser’s seven years worth of polling on the law. Indeed, the poll found that 76 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of the law and 83 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable view. It’s worth noting, though, that like the Pew poll, there was some sign of popularity when respondents were asked by Kaiser what the next president and Congress should do with the law: 49 percent said expand it or implement it as is, compared to 41 percent who said repeal it or scale it back. (That’s not a new sentiment. In April 2014, PolitiFact National gave a Mostly True to this claim: "One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act.") Two more Kaiser questions were not clear one way or the other, in terms of the law’s popularity: Are you and your family better off as a result of the law? The most popular answer -- 50 percent -- was that the law has not made much of a difference to them. Is the country as a whole better off? This was a tie -- 39 percent said better off, 39 percent said worse off. A final point before we close: Some parts of the law get high ratings, although the data isn’t as recent on this. Kaiser’s December 2014 poll asked about five features of the law and three were rated as very or somewhat favorable by 75 percent or more of the respondents: The exchanges, where people who don’t get employer-provided coverage can shop for insurance; financial aid to help lower-income people not covered by employers to buy insurance; the option for states to expand Medicaid to cover more people. (Sixty-four percent had a very or somewhat unfavorable view of the requirement to have insurance or pay a fine.) Our rating Ryan said: Obamacare "is not a popular law." A majority in two national polls done in late-October 2016 say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act. Those findings track polls taken throughout 2016 -- unfavorable or disapprove leads favorable or approve. Similarly, the majority in a September 2016 poll say the law is working somewhat or very poorly. But it’s worth noting that in one October 2016 poll, favorable and unfavorable tied. And in two polls, expanding or keeping the law as-is was favored by more people than repealing it or scaling it back. Overall, Ryan’s statement is accurate, but needs more information – our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1eeb5445-8689-49d1-97a0-300a30fa3225	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-11-17T05:00:00	2016-11-09	['None']

pomt-06287	Says unemployment in Ohio "is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it’s always been that way."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/21/maurice-thompson/ohio-unemployment-significantly-higher-right-work-/	Just days after a two-to-one margin of victory for a "health care freedom" amendment to Ohio’s constitution on the November ballot, the band of Tea Party activists and other conservatives behind that initiative announced a new amendment they would seek. Next up would be a petition drive to get a new issue on the ballot that the group describes as a "workplace freedom amendment," but which is usually called a right-to-work issue. This proposed amendment would forbid forcing a person to join a union as a condition of employment, and it is similar to a proposed amendment that was stomped at the ballot by Ohio voters in 1958. At the well-attended Statehouse news conference Nov. 10, supporters of the amendment argued that not having a right to work law was hurting Ohio’s economy in competing for jobs and hurting the state’s economic growth. One of those speaking on behalf of the right to work bill was Maurice Thompson, the executive director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, the author of the proposed amendment. During his remarks, Thompson attempted to make the case that economic conditions were better in right to work states than in Ohio, citing the Buckeye State’s unemployment rate. "We’re hovering around 9-10 percent unemployment at any given time, which is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it’s always been that way," Thompson said. Just minutes later—at a separate statehouse news conference—House Democrats argued much the opposite -- that unemployment rates in right to work states actually aren’t any lower than Ohio’s. So it seemed like a good time to check into Thompson’s statement. Had Ohio’s unemployment rate "always" been higher? It’s fairly easy to compare unemployment rates in different states thanks to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which diligently tracks and compiles the information each month. Politifact asked Thompson for a source listing right-to-work states and sent us a link to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, which lists 22 states primarily in the south and west which have right-to-work statutes on the books. The fund has a database to the relevant section of law in each state so the fund’s information on what states have the laws looked to be unbiased. We compared Ohio’s unemployment rate of 9.1 for September 2011 to those 22 states and found that eight right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates, 13 had lower unemployment rates and one was precisely the same (Arizona). For what its worth, Ohio’s rate dipped to 9.0 for October, but we’re sticking with the September figures here, as they were the most current numbers available when Thompson made his claim. Three of the 13 states with lower unemployment rates in September were within one percentage point of Ohio’s — Idaho at 9.0 percent, Texas at 8.5 percent and Arkansas at 8.3 percent. If the jobless rate in Ohio is less than one percent greater, does that count as "significantly higher," as Thompson said? We’re not convinced. Thus, we are left with 10 of 22 right-to-work states with "significantly" lower unemployment rates than Ohio. The tail end of Thompson’s statement makes a second claim — that Ohio has always had an unemployment rate higher than right-to-work states. To test this portion of his statement, we looked at both the high and low water marks for Ohio’s unemployment rate over the last decade to give a s snapshot of how Ohio stacked up against right-to-work states during both good and bad economic times. When Ohio had its lowest point of unemployment in the state’s history — 3.8 percent in January 2001 — there were still eight right-to-work states with lower unemployment. Fourteen had higher unemployment rates. When Ohio had the highest rate of unemployment over the last decade — 10.6 percent in Feb. 2010 — 18 states had lower unemployment rates. Four right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates. We think it’s likely that Ohio has ranked somewhere between No.5 and No. 15 in highest unemployment rates when compared to the 22 right-to-work states. Thompson also forwarded information from Stanley Greer, a staffer with the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, who argued that on the average right-to-work states have slightly lower unemployment rates than states without the laws. Greer also produced statistics that argue that private employment has fallen in non right-to-work states but grown in right-to-work states over the past decade. Frankly, we don’t think that information is pertinent to evaluating the truthfulness of Thompson’s claim, which focused solely on the unemployment rate in Ohio as compared to right-to-work states. So let’s return to that. Thompson flatly stated that Ohio’s unemployment rate was "significantly higher" than the rates in right-to-work states and has "always" been that way. But figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that 12 of 22 right-to-work states have unemployment rates that are very similar to Ohio’s or greater. Less than half have "significantly" lower unemployment rates. As for Ohio "always" having had a higher unemployment rate, a check of Ohio’s rate at its highest and lowest points over the past decade shows 14 of the right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates than Ohio when the rate was at its lowest. And when Ohio’s rate was at its highest, there still were four right-to-work states with higher jobless rates. Ohio’s unemployment rate is not higher than all right-to-work states and very likely has never been. Thompson’s claim is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim False.

pomt-10680	"Thanks to President Bush's policies....The income gap is now higher than at any time since the Great Depression."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/15/hillary-clinton/cant-blame-bush/	In her speeches about the economy, Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., often makes the point that the gap between rich and poor has grown during Bush's presidency. "Thanks to President Bush's policies, the poor and middle classes are suffering economically, while the rich are prospering," Clinton said during a Nov. 19, 2007 speech in Knoxville, Iowa. "The income gap is now higher than at any time since the Great Depression." In 2005, "the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans held 22 percent of America's income. That's an astonishing figure, and it is the highest level of income inequality since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929," she said. Clinton's figures are essentially right. She gets them from an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005 and updated this year, which found that the top 1 percent of earners, those making more than $350,500 per year, earned 21.3 percent of the nation's total income in 2005. The U.S. Census Bureau shows a similar disparity, with the top 5 percent of Americans earning 22.3 percent of the income in 2006. Those in the top 20 percent earned about half of the nation's income, while the bottom 20 percent earned just 3.4 percent of the income. However, while some of Bush's policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair to link the president to the rising income gap itself. This is a longtime trend that began to soar in the 1980s and has persisted throughout several presidencies. In fact, the income gap also reached new highs and grew more quickly during the administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat and the husband of Sen. Clinton, than it has under President Bush. Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and the rest of us, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same. Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children's health insurance program that he says helps some who don't need it. "(Bush) passively accepted many of the economic trends that pushed up inequality," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. "But he is not mainly to blame for increased inequality." Clinton is correct, that the income gap is soaring. But she's wrong to lay the blame on Bush. We find her statement Half-True.

pomt-02254	Says Bruce Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/11/freedom-partners/freedom-partners-ad-accuses-rep-bruce-braley-givin/	A new ad by Freedom Partners -- a group that has served as a hub for funding by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch -- recently began airing ads against Democratic Senate candidates, targeting them for their support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. The group had been little known until the Washington Post reported in January that Freedom Partners had "raised $256 million from unknown sources, money that was then transferred to a complex network of LLCs and political nonprofits that do not disclose their donors." By airing the new ads against Democratic Senate candidates, it appears that Freedom Partners is "bringing in-house many of the functions it financed through other groups in the last campaign," the Post reported. One of the Freedom Partners ads attacks Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, who’s running to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Braley will face one of several potential Republican candidates in a general election that independent observers consider competitive. Here’s the full narration of the ad: "No one likes it when politicians give special favors. Congressman Bruce Braley voted for Obamacare. The government spent millions of taxpayer dollars to promote it. Now, health insurance companies stand to make billions. And Bruce Braley? He takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry. For Iowans, it's canceled policies and higher costs. That's not right. Call Bruce Braley. Tell him: Stand with Iowa. Stop supporting Obamacare." There’s a lot to chew on here, but we decided to narrow our focus to the claim that Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare. Did Braley take "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry"? This claim reminded us of the scene from Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in which Dr. Evil (Mike Meyers) threatens to unleash some horrible threat upon the earth unless he is paid -- pausing for dramatic effect -- "one million dollars." His nonplussed advisers gently suggest that he raise the ransom amount, since in today’s dollars, $1 million isn’t really all that much. In Braley’s case, yes -- he took "tens of thousands" from the insurance industry. But saying that misses a whole bunch of important context. Braley has accepted a total of $83,500 from individuals and PACs connected to the insurance industry since his first campaign for the House in the 2006 campaign cycle, according to data gleaned from the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent collector of campaign finance information. That includes $24,250 so far during the 2014 campaign cycle. In isolation, this may sound like a lot. But here’s the context. First, this is money from the "insurance" sector, not necessarily the health insurance sector. Once you strip out car insurance companies, homeowner insurance companies, life insurance companies and the like, the amount is much less. We asked the Center for Responsive Politics to do the stripping for us. Here are the results: Over the last decade, Braley has received a total of $16,000 from health insurance political action committees: $8,500 from Humana, $3,000 from Delta Dental, $2,500 from VSP Holdings and $2,000 from AFLAC. He received an additional $4,500 from eight individual donors employed by a health insurance company, all but one donation smaller than $750. Altogether, this is $20,500 from health insurance sources -- less than a quarter of his take from insurers more generally, and about $2,000 for every year he’s served in Congress. "This is not a lot of money to influence a huge vote like that," said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. If we are going to compare Braley to other Senate candidates on an apples-to-apples basis, it’s only feasible to use the the Center for Responsive Politics’ standard data for "insurance" companies. So how does Braley’s insurance haul compare to that other lawmakers? Not very impressively. Among all Senate candidates running in 2014, Braley ranks 55th. Since there are just 36 Senate races this year, some of which feature minimal opposition to incumbents, that’s pretty low indeed for a sitting House member in a competitive seat to rank 55th. And how big a share of Braley’s warchest comes from this broader swath of the insurance industry? Not very big. The insurance industry ranks 19th on the list of biggest sector donors to Braley’s campaigns over his entire career. For the 2014 cycle, insurance ranks 16th among all sectors donating to Braley. In all, insurance donations account for less than 1 percent of all the cash Braley has raised during his political career. (The industry that ranks No. 1 -- giving $4,084,645 over the course of Braley’s career -- is "lawyers and law firms." This connection recently caused a major embarrassment for Braley when he was caught on videotape jabbing Sen. Chuck Grassley, the popular Republican he’s seeking to join in the Senate, as "a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." Slate’s John Dickerson joked that Braley’s farm-state gaffe was so massive "that the Environmental Protection Agency may seek to regulate it.") Was it a special favor to the health insurance industry to vote for Obamacare? For one thing, it’s not as simple as the ad says -- the insurance industry hardly loves every aspect of the law, so it’s not clear that voting for it was an undiluted gift for the industry. "In particular, the medical loss ratio that limits their profits and requires 80 cents on each dollar be spent on insurance recipients keeps their profits from soaring," Ornstein said. In addition, it strains logic to think that Braley would have turned from an opponent of the law, or even agnostic about it, to a supporter of it simply because of the desires of donors who collectively gave him a fraction of one percent of his total campaign warchest. It’s not as if Braley had built his political career on being a foe of a health care overhaul. Like most Democrats, he supported policies to lower the number of uninsured Americans. During his first campaign for the House in 2006, "Braley called for expanding health care for the uninsured," according to the 2008 edition of the Almanac of American Politics. And in September 2009, when the House health care bill was on its way to the floor, the Des Moines Register reported that Braley said that the often divisive town meetings about health care had only stiffened his resolve. "You've been out there talking about your values for health care reform and, for some of us, it's made us more dedicated than ever to doing something meaningful about health care reform," Braley said, according to the newspaper. Combined, Braley’s past promises and pressure from his party are likely to have outweighed any campaign donations from the industry, Ornstein said. The partisan pressure to toe the line on the health care bill was especially strong because it was the No. 1 legislative priority of a president from his own party, and the vote would be decided essentially along party lines. "Political science scholars have spilled much ink and used countless hours of computer time linking these kinds of ordinary contributions to voting outcomes, and have come up with very little," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. A final point: If the ad considers donations from the insurance industry to be the linchpin of a politician’s support for Obamacare, how can this explain the overall pattern of donations by the insurance industry? As it turns out, nine of the 13 Senate candidates who received the most money from the insurance industry in 2014 are Republicans, a list headed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who received $231,800. Yet despite the backing of the industry, none of these Republicans voted for Obamacare. And what about Braley’s fellow Iowan, Grassley? Grassley -- who did not vote for Obamacare -- has received $318,202 from the insurance industry in the 2014 cycle, or about 13 times as much as Braley did over the same period. And the insurance industry’s ranking among the industries donating to Grassley? It ranks first. Freedom Partners’ argument A spokesman for Freedom Partners, James Davis, said just looking at the size of the donations misses the point. "What's important to understand is that our ad isn't just about dollar amounts, it's about hypocrisy," Davis said. He pointed to an ad by the pro-Braley independent group Senate Majority PAC that said Braley wants to "hold insurance companies accountable" and "knows we can’t go back to letting insurance companies deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and kick people off their coverage when they get sick." (Both were policies outlawed by passage of Obamacare, and which would be at risk of re-emerging after an Obamacare repeal unless specifically protected.) "The point we're making is: How can Rep. Braley claim he's standing up to health insurance companies, while at the same time taking their campaign donations and supporting Obamacare – a huge boon to the health insurance industry?" Davis said. "It's not about where he falls in the line of donations – it's about saying one thing and doing another." However, we don’t think the use of the phrase "special favors" and "friends in the health insurance industry" suggests hypocrisy. Rather, it all but suggests that Braley is corrupt, pursuing damaging policies because he gains personally from interested parties. And on that score, the evidence is thin indeed. We asked Freedom Partners if they had any evidence of favors Braley had done for specific companies, but the group did not reply. Our ruling Freedom Partners’ ad claims that Braley took "tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industry" and gave them "special favors" by voting for Obamacare. Braley did take tens of thousands of dollars from the insurance industry, though from all types of insurers, not just health insurers. However, Braley, like most Democrats, had campaigned on expanding health coverage to the uninsured, and then, faced with a landmark and highly partisan vote, carried through on his stated intentions. It’s ridiculous to suggest that donors who contributed less than 1 percent of his warchest weighed more heavily on his vote than his ideology, his past campaign promises and his partisan affiliation.

pomt-04035	"Approximately 43 percent of all college grades today are A's, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960."	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/31/thomas-lindsay/thomas-lindsay-says-43-percent-college-grades-are-/	More than 4 in 10 college grades are A’s and that’s way up from 50 years ago, Thomas K. Lindsay of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation recently wrote. In a Jan. 12, 2013, opinion column in the Austin American-Statesman, Lindsay prefaced his claim by saying students study less than they once did. "Worse, grades during this period have, paradoxically, increased. Approximately 43 percent of all college grades today are A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960," Lindsay said. We're not delving into how much students study. But a reader urged us to check on A’s over the decades. Lindsay, director of the foundation’s Center for Higher Education, soon pointed us to a July 14, 2011, New York Times blog post summarizing a study of grades awarded at colleges and universities over the past several decades. "Most recently, about 43 percent of all letter grades given were A’s, an increase of 28 percentage points since 1960 and 12 percentage points since 1988," the blog post says. "The distribution of B’s has stayed relatively constant; the growing share of A’s instead comes at the expense of a shrinking share of C’s, D’s and F’s. In fact, only about 10 percent of grades awarded are D’s and F’s." According to the post, "private colleges and universities are by far the biggest offenders on grade inflation," with A’s and B’s representing 73 percent of all grades awarded at public schools by the end of last decade, and 86 percent of all grades awarded at private schools. The cited study was conducted by Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University geophysics professor, and Christopher Healy, an associate professor of computer science at Furman University in South Carolina. To our inquiry, Rojstaczer guided us to an online copy of the study, which said that grades in recent years were compiled from web searches, other studies and information from 135 colleges and universities, including "mostly continuous data" from 14 schools covering the 1960s or earlier to the 2000s. For the early 1960s, 11 to 13 schools were "represented by our national averages," the study says. In 1960, the study says, C was the most common grade nationwide and D’s and F’s accounted for more grades, combined, than A’s. By 1965, though, "B had supplanted C as the most common grade, and D’s and F’s were becoming increasingly less common." "From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, grades rose rapidly across the nation, and A became the second most common grade awarded," the study says. After a dip in A’s in the 1970s into the early 1980s, the study says, from 1984 to the mid-2000s, the proportion of A’s increased by a factor of 1.5. "By 2008, A’s were nearly three times more common than they were in 1960," the study says. "For the 135 schools in our database with contemporary data, A’s are handed out 43% of the time on average," the study says. We sought more information on the A’s from 1960. By email, Healy told us the data referring to 1960 may have included information from the years 1959 and 1961 since for a given college, the researchers could have had data for one year but not the next. As of late January 2013, he said, he had grade information for that period from 16 institutions, up from 14 or so when the study was published. He emailed us a list indicating the institutions providing grades from around 1960 include Penn State University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; the University of Wisconsin; and Rice University. Both researchers said it’s reasonable to compare course grades at 14 schools or so in 1960 to course grades gleaned from 135 institutions in recent years. Healy said the mix of circa-1960 schools, which included private institutions such as Pomona College and Furman, represents more selective institutions compared with the bigger present-day sample, which includes more less-selective colleges. "So, if anything, if there had been no grade inflation, one would expect the sample of today's colleges to show slightly lower grades than in our 1960 sample," Healy said. He elaborated by phone: "A less-selective school would award fewer As, hence there would be less of gap." For a long time, he said, more-selective schools have tended to award more generous grades. "They also tend to have the best students," he said. In Texas, Texas A&M University and Texas State University have provided grades to the researches. At A&M in 1985, the researchers say, 26 percent of grades given in undergraduate courses were A’s compared with 39 percent in 2011. At Texas State in 1960, 14 percent of grades were A’s; the tally in 2007 was 34 percent, the researchers say. Healy said that at both institutions, the prevalence of A’s slightly trailed national averages. For outside perspective, we asked Shouping Hu, a Florida State University professor of higher education, to evaluate the 2011 study. Hu, who edited a 2005 book on changes in student grades, said by email that there has been an upward trend in college grades, though it may not be accurate to attribute that to "grade inflation." We weren’t sure how to interpret that; Hu did not elaborate. By phone, Rojstaczer commented by saying that at some schools, the quality of students has increased. "You can attribute up to 30 percent of the rise in grades at some institutions to students being demonstrably better than they once were," he said. Still, he said, it’s not plausible that 43 percent of students, on average, are doing excellent class work, which means there has been grade inflation. Next, we asked Arthur Levine, president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and former president of Teachers College at Columbia University, for thoughts on the 2011 study. Levine said by phone that while grades from 14 colleges represent a small sample, that’s not problematic if researchers also check course grades at the institutions in subsequent years--which Rojstaczer and Healy did. If so, Levine said, "they’re comparing apples to apples." Levine has incorporated surveys of students about their GPAs into his own work. In 1969, he said, 7 percent of surveyed students at two- and four-year colleges said their GPA was A-minus or higher. In 2009, he said, 41 percent of students reported as much. Broadly, Levine said, grade inflation started when professors took it easier on male students to spare them from being sent to Vietnam. The 2011 study says that after the Vietnam era, a decline in A’s lasted roughly a decade, but the share of A’s began to rise again in the mid-1980s. Healy told us that he believes factors behind the renewed upward sweep include professors being more mindful of student evaluations and feeling pressure to award high grades so that students can advance to law or medical school. Our ruling Lindsay wrote that about 43 percent of all college grades today are A's, an increase of 28 percentage points from 1960. That’s supported by a 2011 study covering grades from 1960 into the 2000s, making this claim True.	None	Thomas Lindsay	None	None	None	2013-01-31T06:00:00	2013-01-12	['None']

pomt-01357	Says a bill he vetoed to give driver licenses to certain immigrants known as Dreamers would have changed "nothing."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-bill-give-drivers-licenses-daca-im/	Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are competing for the Hispanic vote, leading the candidates to argue about their stances on everything from the Cuba embargo to rights for illegal immigrants. During the Telemundo debate Oct. 10, the debate moderator asked the candidates to explain their conflicting views on driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. In 2013, the Legislature passed a bill to give driver licenses to those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, sometimes called "Dreamers." Scott vetoed it. Crist, a Democrat, said during the debate: "I’m in favor of a driver’s license for Dreamers. The governor recently signed a bill where they can have in-state tuition. And that was a good thing to do. But if you can’t drive to school, or you can’t drive to your job, good luck getting to work." Scott, a Republican, responded: "The driver’s license bill that was passed, nothing changed. Those same individuals have the right to get a Florida driver’s license today." Scott was partially correct and partially misleading. Floridians who get Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called DACA, generally get work permits, which they can use to get driver’s licenses. But he is overstating the situation when he says "nothing changed," because that bill would have affirmatively given those immigrants the right to use their DACA forms to get a driver’s license, even if their work permit didn’t arrive simultaneously. Scott vetoed the driver license bill In 2012, Obama announced DACA, which allows illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation, as long as they can prove they are law abiding and meet other requirements. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals nationwide received initial deferred action including 23,196 in Florida. In 2013, Florida lawmakers proposed HB 235. The proposal would allow Dreamers to use their new federal status as a way to obtain a temporary driver license. A Florida House analysis said that without the law, Dreamers would first have to receive an employment authorization card before they could receive a temporary driver license. In April 2013, the Florida bill sailed through unanimously in the Senate and with only two "no" votes in the House. Scott vetoed the bill June 4, 2013. In his veto message, Scott bashed the Obama administration for implementing DACA and then argued that the bill was unnecessary: "Already, Florida law allows those with a federal employment authorization card, without regard to their deferred action status, to obtain a temporary Florida driver license. Although the Legislature may have been well intentioned in seeking to expedite the process to obtain a temporary driver license, it should not have been done by relying on a federal government policy adopted without legal basis." PolitiFact Florida asked spokespersons for Scott’s office and campaign to explain his evidence that the bill would not have changed anything and if that was the case why he bothered vetoing it. The only response we received was a copy of Scott’s veto. Democrats and immigrant rights’ groups criticized Scott’s veto and characterized it as a blow to Hispanics. But some news reports characterized Scott’s driver license veto as largely symbolic since immigrants could still get a driver license with the federal work permit. The ACLU of Florida, which criticized Scott’s veto, sent a letter to the state Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles stating "the veto should have no impact on DHSMV’s current practice of granting driver’s licenses to current DACA recipients who have employment authorization." Federal immigration officials told PolitiFact Florida that people apply for DACA and the work permit at the same time and nearly everyone gets both. United States Citizenship and Immigration Service approved 591,555 requests for DACA between Aug. 15, 2012 and July 31, 2014. During the same period, the agency denied 635 applications for work permits. Potential reasons include failing to sign the forms or provide property documentation. Most of the immigration law experts we interviewed said that generally applicants get DACA and work permits at the same time, though some had heard anecdotes about people who got their DACA days, weeks or months before the work permit. Since such a delay could occur, the Legislature wanted to give these immigrants the right to use DACA to get their driver’s licenses as quickly as possible. "It was basically to give those folks an opportunity to get their driver’s license right away," bill sponsor state Rep. Randolph Bracy, D-Orlando, told PolitiFact Florida. "Sometimes they get their approval letter and work permit at the same time but sometimes they don’t. It was just a show of support toward the Dreamers and said ‘we are behind you.’ " Our ruling Scott said that "nothing changed" for certain illegal immigrants to get driver licenses in a bill he vetoed. There was a change in the bill: It would have affirmatively stated that immigrants with DACA approval could use that documentation to get driver’s licenses. Scott vetoed the bill, so immigrants don’t have that right. However, applicants for DACA simultaneously apply for a work permit and generally get their approvals around the same time. If Scott hadn’t vetoed the bill, it would have meant that those who get DACA first wouldn’t have to wait for their work permit, although it is sometimes a short wait. The claim is partially accurate in that immigrants who get DACA will likely get a work permit and they can use that work permit to get the driver’s license. However, Scott exaggerated when he said "nothing changed" in the bill he vetoed. We rate this claim Half True. Editor's note: This report initially appeared with conflicted rulings.

pomt-11958	"In 2017, I've done 17 town halls."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-asked-if-hes-interacting-texans-says-hes-/	He’s not Waldo. But could it be that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas doesn’t get personally grilled by constituents very often? Cruz, a Republican poised to seek re-election in 2018, hardly has a reputation of avoiding attention. After all, he ran for president shortly after making waves in Washington and held on as the last viable Republican alternate to Donald Trump. Regardless, the Houston lawyer was told during the 2017 Texas Tribune Festival about a Democratic challenger’s suggestion that Cruz hadn’t visited small Texas towns during the term he won in 2012. "Do you do enough interaction with your constituents, Sen. Cruz?" interviewer Evan Smith asked. Cruz replied: "That is a huge part of the job. In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls." We wondered about that. A town hall, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack later noted by email, is defined by Merriam-Webster as "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members." By that definition, Novack was nudging, town halls don’t have to be open to just anybody to ask anything. Indeed, when we looked, Merriam-Webster followed its definition with this sample sentence: "Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on." Cruz’s office lists 19 events Novack otherwise told us Cruz had held 19 town halls with Texas constituents in 2017, all "organized by third parties who determined attendees, where" the senator "has taken unvetted questions from anyone in the crowd--at businesses, factories, chambers of commerce, and in public venues." Novack said three of the gatherings--which would be 16 percent--"were open for the general public to register and attend." Those, he said, were hosted by Concerned Veterans for America, a group that seeks to shift veterans hospitals from the federal government to a nonprofit corporation. Eleven of the 19 events were open to reporters, Novack said, four were aired live. Novack provided a chart specifying each event, its date and location, which shows three events were hosted by business chambers of commerce and a dozen were hosted by business groups or specific businesses. Individual businesses hosted 11 of the listed events that weren’t open to the general public, according to the chart. The businesses, including Division Laundry & Cleaners in San Antonio, Sysco Central Texas in New Braunfels and Igloo Products Corp. in Katy, had employee town halls with Cruz, the chart says. The veterans group, per the chart, hosted Cruz at July events in McKinney, Austin and Houston. On Aug. 24, the chart says, the Border Patrol union hosted the senator at an El Paso meeting. By email to our inquiry, a CVA spokesman, Jim Fellinger, told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration, without the group screening out anybody who registered. "Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions by submitting question cards that were handed out at the beginning of the event," Fellinger said. "These events involved a discussion about bringing greater health care choice to the Department of Veterans Affairs." Fellinger pointed us to video posts of the CVA events showing that Cruz each time took questions via a moderator, who recognized a few individuals to speak directly to Cruz. We didn’t spot any questions straying from health care. Events confirmed Next, we confirmed from press releases, news stories and video snippets that Cruz made the appearances described in the Novack-provided chart. Events in bold on the chart below were open to reporters, Phil Novack, a spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz, said.

Ted Cruz, Sept. 28, 2017 We also asked Novack to share 2017 events Cruz had in Texas that were open to the public without registration--where anyone could ask a question on any topic. Novack replied by email: "I appreciate your efforts to move the goalposts but we’ll stick with the premise of your original question to us" about town halls. Experts evaluate Cruz's claim Next, we shared our annotated version of the chart by email with academic experts and requested appraisals of Cruz’s statement that he’d done 17 "town halls." Several deemed the claim inaccurate because most of the tallied events, especially meetings limited to business employees, weren’t forums open to all or likely to encourage wide-open questions and answers. A Duquesne University professor, Mike Dillon, replied: "The term ‘town hall’ implies an event is open to the entire community and that competing ideas will be welcomed and discussed. It seems these town halls are open only to the people from the sections of ‘town’ that support Ted Cruz. These are scripted pseudo-events," Dillon wrote, "not genuine public forums." Ashley Trim, a Pepperdine University administrator, agreed that an "employee town hall" is far from the original use of the "town hall" term. Still, Trim told us, it’s not uncommon for employers to have or host Q&A sessions and call them town halls. But University of Alabama political scientist Joe Smith commented: "Employees know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome." Smith elaborated: "Since employees depend on these employers for their livelihoods, they are not likely to be fully candid in expressing their views. Also, attendees at this sort of gathering won’t feel able to bring up any topics they want to. Topics are likely to be limited to those related to the employer’s business area." Smith said he’d rate the CVA-hosted events and possibly three chamber of commerce town halls as more wide-open. Mark Rozell, a George Mason University dean, called the listed events mostly "quite different" from traditional open town halls held by members of Congress. "So it's apples and oranges here," Rozell said, adding: "The senator's office cannot just slap the label ‘town hall’ on site visits to factories and companies and then claim he's holding a lot of town halls. That's misleading." Rozell later agreed there persists "no precise, legal definition of what constitutes a town hall. So I suppose the senator, or any other member, can play word games and try to label any gathering of a group of people a ‘town hall’ in an attempt to rebut criticism for holding too few town halls. But it doesn't pass the common sense test to call a factory visit or selected audience event a ‘town hall.’" In contrast, Trim, who directs a Pepperdine public engagement institute, said Cruz’s use of the "town hall" term struck her as "valid within the common use of the term ‘town hall’ in 21st century America." After all, Trim reminded, town hall meetings have greatly evolved from their New England roots as community gatherings to set a hamlet’s course. Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist, said Cruz’s claim fits a "minimalist" definition of town hall in that they involved the senator speaking to, and fielding questions from, constituents from all walks of life across the state. But for a town hall "maximalist," Jones wrote, none of Cruz’s events would qualify as a town hall "because they were held in largely controlled settings and were not open to the general public" with the exception of the veterans gatherings open to people registering ahead of time. John Gastil, a Penn State University professor, said that while the "town hall" term has lost clarity of definition over the years, he thinks Cruz’s claim was made to affirm his availability to the public. Gastil offered as keys to gauging the claim’s accuracy whether each event was open to the public and had an open agenda or one limited to a particular issue--and also whether members of the public at each event were allowed to speak and ask questions, with the senator proving responsive. Gastil conceded he didn’t have time to fact-check the entire Cruz-provided list of events. But on their face, he wrote, "only a few seem worth checking further. Events held by and at private corporations wouldn't count as a town hall. Those sponsored by nongovernmental organizations have a better prospect of being town halls (e.g., chambers of commerce), but you'd need to see affirmative evidence" that they were open to the public and had an open agenda. Cruz’s claim "strikes me as dubious," Gastil summed up. "Electeds do meet-and-greets with employees and other such things frequently, as part of their outreach, but it's disingenuous to call them ‘town halls.’" Our ruling Cruz, asked if he interacts enough with constituents, said: "In 2017, I’ve done 17 town halls" in Texas. The listed events Cruz attended from April through August 2017 demonstrate that the term ‘town hall’ can be stretched every which way, even to events not open to the public. All told, it looks to us like Cruz took questions at gatherings of selected constituents, mostly business employees--with the three veterans events open to members of the public who registered.

The ad, which debuted Nov. 16, 2011, opens with a video clip of Obama saying, "We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades." Perry then appears, saying: "Can you believe that? That's what our president thinks is wrong with America? That Americans are lazy? That's pathetic." Perry made a similar claim a day earlier during an Iowa speech, according to the text of his remarks. Referring to the United States' economic troubles, Perry said: "In recent weeks, our president has taken to pointing the finger of blame instead of taking responsibility. He has called us soft and lazy." We'd heard the "soft" charge before. In an Oct. 14 speech unveiling his energy policy proposals, Perry said Obama "has labeled Americans as soft." We rated that statement, which amped up a statement Obama had made about the country getting soft in the past, Half True. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Perry rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has also accused Obama of calling Americans lazy. According to a Nov. 16, 2011, post on a MSNBC.com political blog, Romney said this while campaigning a day earlier in South Carolina: "Sometimes, I just don't think that President Obama understands America. I say that because this week — or was it last week — he said that Americans are lazy. I don't think that describes America." In his ad, Perry accuses Obama of thinking Americans are lazy. We can’t test what anyone, including Obama, is thinking. So, in this article, we're gauging whether Obama really indicated that he thinks Americans have been lazy. We traced Obama's comment to a question-and-answer session with the head of Boeing on Nov. 12, 2011, at a meeting of business leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Honolulu. The conversation between Jim McNerney and Obama touched on the regional economy, world trade and what the president characterized as a "re-engagement" by the United States with Pacific Rim countries. Obama said that there is no area he considers more vital and that the United States wants to work with other Pacific Rim countries to "enhance job growth, economic growth, prosperity and security for all of us." "I think we spent a decade in which, understandably, after 9/11, we were very focused on security issues, particularly in the Middle East region," Obama said. "And those continue to be important. But we've turned our attention back to the Asia-Pacific region, and I think that it's paying off immediately in a whole range of improved relations with countries, and businesses are starting to see more opportunities as a consequence." The conversation soon turned to the complicated relationship that the United States has with China. Obama made his "lazy" comment in response to a question from McNerney about impediments that China might see to investing in the United States. "Well, this is an issue, generally," Obama said. "I think it's important to remember that the United States is still the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world. And there are a lot of things that make foreign investors see the U.S. as a great opportunity — our stability, our openness, our innovative free market culture. "But, you know, we’ve been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We’ve kind of taken for granted — well, people will want to come here — and we aren’t out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America. And so one of the things that my administration has done is set up something called SelectUSA that organizes all the government agencies to work with state and local governments where they're seeking assistance from us, to go out there and make it easier for foreign investors to build a plant in the United States and put outstanding U.S. workers back to work in the United States of America." Two days later, a reporter asked White House spokesman Josh Earnest to explain what Obama meant by his "lazy" remark. Earnest said Obama "was making the case" that it's time for U.S. foreign policy to focus on the Asia-Pacific region because there's "an enormous economic opportunity" there. Earnest continued: "And so that is why the president has made this a focus of his foreign policy moving forward. I don't think that — it's the president's view that this region has not been the focus in recent history, and that's what the president was alluding to, that we are in a circumstance where we need to redouble our efforts to be engaged in this region." So where does that leave us? Partly pondering who Obama meant by "we." In the MSNBC.com blog post, Mark Murray, deputy political director for NBC News, says Obama "wasn't calling Americans lazy; rather, he was calling U.S. business practices to attract foreign investors lazy." Another possibility: Speaking with McNerney, Obama often used "we" to refer to the U.S. government or his administration. So the president may have been criticizing the federal government's efforts to help attract investment from abroad. After all, in his next sentence, Obama points to a Commerce Department website (SelectUSA) that says it "seeks to highlight the many advantages the United States offers as a location for business and investment." Our ruling: Obama said America had acted lazily in some regard. Exactly whom he considers lazy, we're still not sure. But it’s clear that he was not wagging his finger at the American public at large. Perry's presentation distorts the president's remark by taking it out of context. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04188	Says the Obama administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/dec/11/chain-email/chain-email-says-obama-administration-plans-use-in/	According to a chain email, President Barack Obama recently "took the first major step in a plan to ban all firearms in the United States." The email, sent to us by a curious Austin reader, continues: "The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for U.S. citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the U.S. State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress." Talk about an explosive agenda. Still, we launched into this look with skepticism since a similar fact-check boiled out to nothing but smoke. U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James drew a Pants on Fire in May 2012 after declaring that Obama and Hillary Clinton were seeking a treaty to ban the use of U.S. firearms. So we kept the matches handy. The recent chain email’s references to administration plans are presented as if they were part of an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article headlined: "U.S. reverses stance on treaty to regulate arms trade." Datelined Washington, the actual article opens: "The United States reversed policy on Wednesday and said it would back launching talks on a treaty to regulate arms sales as long as the talks operated by consensus, a stance critics said gave every nation a veto. The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush's administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better." In July 2012, the United States participated in the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, but the negotiations adjourned after four weeks amid a lack of consensus, according to a July 27, 2012, New York Times news article. The treaty cannot take effect unless every country signs off. The Times’ story says that major arms exporters — the United States, Russia and China — had said more time was needed before action. The story says, too, there was friction over whether the treaty would infringe on U.S. gun rights. Also, it says, 51 senators had urged the Obama administration not to sign the treaty — of significance considering U.S. ratification of any treaty would require 67 Senate votes. According to the story, the treaty would establish common international standards for authorizing international arms transfers. The newspaper said a draft version said a prime purpose is to "prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and their diversion to illegal and unauthorized end use." It would also prohibit signatories from transferring conventional weapons that violate arms embargoes or enable those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the story says. So, treaty gone? Not necessarily. On the day after Obama won re-election, the U.S. backed a U.N. committee’s call to renew debate over the treaty, Reuters reported in a Nov. 7, 2012, news article, adding that such a resolution is expected to clear the U.N. General Assembly, leading to a resumption of talks in March 2013. The story quotes an unidentified U.S. official as saying: "We seek a treaty that contributes to international security by fighting illicit arms trafficking and proliferation, protects the sovereign right of states to conduct legitimate arms trade, and meets the concerns that we have been articulating throughout. We will not accept any treaty that infringes on the constitutional rights of our citizens to bear arms," the official is quoted as saying. The story also says that "U.S. officials have acknowledged privately that the treaty under discussion would have no effect on domestic gun sales and ownership because it would apply only to exports." We’re not inclined to rely on comments by unidentified officials. In our James’ fact-check, though, we noted an April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington by Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. Countryman summarized the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced. "We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment," Countryman said. "...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support." As we reviewed this chain email, Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us the treaty is intended to apply only to the international arms trade. The U.N. cannot regulate firearms within countries "on any ground whatsoever," Buchanan said. "It has no domestic jurisdiction." Buchanan also provided a June 2012 U.N. "Myths and Facts" handout that includes denials the body is contemplating a ban on gun ownership. "The U.N. is not pursuing a global treaty to ban gun ownership by civilians," the handout says. "Member states are committed to tightening controls over the international import, export and transfers of conventional arms, because without such controls it is easier for weapons to be diverted from the legal trade into the illegal market, and into the hands of terrorists, drug traffickers and criminal cartels." The handout also says: "Each sovereign state determines its own laws and regulations for the manufacture, sale and possession of firearms by its citizens. The United Nations has no jurisdiction over such matters... No UN agreement exists banning firearms possession." A July 27, 2012, draft of the treaty makes many references to restricting the international arms trade. As far as we could tell, it lacks provisions for the international community to regulate firearms within countries. Its preamble even notes the "legitimate trade and use of certain conventional arms ... for recreational, cultural, historical and sporting activities and lawful ownership where such ownership and use are permitted and protected by law." The preamble also affirms the sovereign right and responsibility of any country to "regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems." Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, expressed objections to the treaty to the United Nations on July 11, 2012, saying in testimony that the group would drop its opposition only if civilian firearms were not included. The draft treaty says it will apply to all conventional arms including battle tanks; armored combat vehicles; large-caliber artillery systems; combat aircraft; attack helicopters; warships; missiles and missile launchers; and small arms and light weapons. We called the association to explore how the Obama administration might use the treaty to ban all U.S. weapons and didn’t hear back. Our ruling The chain email says the administration plans to ban all weapons for U.S. citizens through international treaties. We found no evidence of such plans, instead consistent indications to the contrary. This chain email is also so off target, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-11329	Says "Eric Holder and his group came in and made" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race "highly partisan."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/11/scott-walker/scott-walker-claim-eric-holder-making-supreme-cour/	Is Barack Obama’s attorney general, a possible candidate for president, to blame for making a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign "highly partisan"? Republican Gov. Scott Walker raised the issue six days after Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who was backed by liberals, won election to the high court. Her win in the officially nonpartisan race raised hopes among Democrats of a "blue wave" of election victories, including denying Walker a third term in November 2018. Walker was interviewed April 9, 2018 by Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Referring to Dallet’s defeat of Michael Screnock, a Sauk County circuit judge backed by Walker and other conservatives, Walker said: Even Tuesday's election for the Supreme Court -- which, in the end, kind of boiled down to a ballot test between parties, even though it's supposedly nonpartisan, and that's really because Eric Holder and his group came in and made it highly partisan. Wisconsin Supreme Court races have seen partisan involvement in recent years, but the 2018 race set a new standard for partisanship. Let’s see if it was Holder -- the attorney general for most of Obama’s presidency, who is considering a run for president himself in 2020 -- who made the Supreme Court race "highly partisan." Holder’s involvement On March 15 and 16, 2018, Holder campaigned for Dallet in Milwaukee and Madison. At the time, he said the group he leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was spending $140,000 on digital ads backing Dallet and that it might spend more. Later in the campaign, it was reported that Holder’s committee had spent a total of $165,000 to support Dallet. But on election night, the group said that it and its affiliates had "invested more than $500,000" to elect Dallet. (Note: In February 2018, Holder’s committee sued Walker over his refusal to call special elections to fill two open legislative seats. The suit successfully forced Walker to call the elections.) So, Holder himself and his group played a major role in backing Dallet. And it’s true that as national figures, Holder and his group added a national partisan dimension to the race. But the Wisconsin Republican Party played a major role in backing Screnock, starting before Holder did, and it doesn’t get much more partisan than a political party. First in -- the GOP Months before Holder’s involvement, Republican Party groups in Wisconsin started backing Screnock. For example, on Nov. 9, 2017, five months before election day, the Washington County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee gave $500 to Screnock’s campaign. Later, other county parties, including those in Racine, Polk, Ozaukee, Sheboygan and Walworth counties, gave to Screnock’s campaign. On Feb. 8, 2018, the state GOP gave Screnock’s campaign a $31,152 in-kind donation. And five days later, Screnock’s campaign reported having received nearly $111,000 more from the GOP. On March 27, 2018, the state party announced a statewide radio, direct mail, digital, and billboard advertisement campaign attacking Dallet. In all, Screnock’s campaign received about $400,000 in help from the state and local Republican parties, the Associated Press reported. Our rating Walker says "Holder and his group came in and made" the Wisconsin Supreme Court race "highly partisan." Holder came to Wisconsin in March 2018, a few weeks before election day, to campaign for Dallet. And a group he leads said it and its affiliates spent more than $500,000 backing Dallet. That added a national partisan dimension to the campaign. But you can’t get any more partisan than a political party, and county Republican Party groups started backing Screnock months earlier, in November 2017. Ultimately, Republican Party groups, led by the state party, backed Screnock to the tune of some $400,000. For a statement that contains only some truth, we give Walker a Mostly False.

pomt-06206	"When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today: 'Yeah, we're open.'"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/09/jon-stewart/comic-jon-stewart-says-early-congress-met-most-chr/	The Rhode Island controversy over Gov. Lincoln Chafee's decision to call the decorated spruce tree in the State House rotunda a "holiday tree" instead of a "Christmas tree" spilled over to Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show" program on Dec. 6. During a segment on the "Tree Fighting Ceremony" that focused on Fox News' assertion that there is a culture war against Christmas, Stewart said, "Perhaps you'd prefer to celebrate Christmas the way our Founding Fathers did." Then he cut to a video clip from a documentary from the History channel cable network that stated: "On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session and continued to stay open on Christmas Day for most of the next 67 years." "That's right," Steward added. "When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today. 'Yeah. We're open.'" We were intrigued by the idea that members of Congress in the early days would be on the job most Christmas Days, even if Dec. 25 fell on a weekend. So we started digging. As the program made clear, Stewart was quoting a History channel program, "Christmas Unwrapped - The History of Christmas." A Google search also brought us to an American Civil Liberties Union website on the "Origins of Christmas." It includes this quote: "Congress met on Christmas Day every year from 1789 to 1855, with only three exceptions." It lists the source as a 2007 article from the journal Word and World called "Christmas Was Not Always Like This: A Brief History" by Bruce David Forbes. The ACLU web page also references the History channel website, which says that "Christmas wasn't a holiday in early America—in fact Congress was in session on December 25, 1789, the country's first Christmas under the new constitution." We turned to Donald Ritchie, historian of the U.S. Senate. He had his doubts, saying that Congress typically took Christmas Day off. They didn't take a longer Christmas break, as they do now, because, in those days, traveling back to the home districts took too long. From there, we dug into the records. Our first discovery: the claim that "On Dec. 25, 1789, the United States Congress sat in session" is flat-out wrong. The web page "Dates of Sessions of the Congress, 1789-present" says that the last session of 1789 for both the House and the Senate was Sept. 29. By the time Christmas came around, Congress had been out of session for nearly three months. Both bodies reconvened on the first Monday in January 1790. The web page also shows that there were three years from 1789 to 1857 when Congress had a formal recess that extended over Christmas Day. But that doesn't mean they were on the job on Dec. 25 during all the remaining years. To find out, we went through the journals that were the predecessors of The Congressional Record. So how many times did the House and Senate meet on Christmas Day during the first 68 years of Congress? Once each. The Senate assembled and immediately adjourned on Christmas Day in 1797; the House met on Christmas in 1802. Our ruling Jon Stewart, ridiculing Fox News' coverage of the "War on Christmas," repeated a claim by the History channel that Congress met nearly every Christmas Day from 1789 to 1856. The ACLU makes the same claim, based on a magazine article. But daily records show the complete opposite, with just one exception each for the House and Senate. So the assertion that Congress met virtually every Christmas during that period is completely False. The idea that members would do so when there's a 1 in 7 chance that Dec. 25 would fall on a Sunday makes this idea ridiculous. So gather friends and family around the hearth as we give this Christmas claim by Stewart, the ACLU and the History channel a collective Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13318	"It’s bad enough that (Stephen) Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets. But when Silberkraus isn’t acting in films that degrade women, he’s stalking them in his personal time."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/oct/06/lesley-cohen/nevada-assemblyman-accused-appearing-fetish-film-s/	Political attack ads typically stick to the same ol’ stuff, like voting records and candidate positions. That can’t be said for the jabs in Henderson, Nev., where voters in one state Assembly district are getting smacked with attacks on a pornographic level. Democratic Assembly candidate Lesley Cohen is spreading several campaign mail pieces accusing her opponent, incumbent Republican Stephen Silberkraus, of appearing in a "fetish film" and stalking women. "It’s bad enough that Silberkraus appeared in a sexual fetish film where women were kidnapped from their homes and forced to live naked in kennels and trained to be pets," it reads. "But when Silberkraus isn’t acting in films that degrade women, he’s stalking them in his personal time." It’s certainly not a standard political attack line, but is there any truth to it? Silberkraus did appear in a fetish film, but there’s more to it than the ad lets on — and the claim about stalking is even further from the truth. Film career Under the stage name of Stephen Neill, Silberkraus appeared as an extra in dozens of television shows, including The West Wing, Entourage, CSI, Power Rangers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with a film career spanning from the 1990s to the mid 2000s. The film cited in the mailer is called The Pet, a poorly received 2006 exploitation film based on the concepts of "human pets" and sexual slavery. "A young woman in dire financial straights accepts an offer to be a wealthy aristocrat's human ‘pet’ for six months," the plot summary reads. "Then ruthless modern ‘pet-nappers’ kidnap the woman to sell her on the GSM, " referring to the "Global Slave Market." Silberkraus appears briefly in the film as a trader on this market, and delivers a handful of lines in about 30 seconds of screen time. Reached by PolitiFact, the Republican Assemblyman said he was on set for one day to film his scene, and was at the time assuming that the film would be a more serious look at human trafficking. He called the finished product a "cheesy B-movie" and disparaged Cohen for propagating a "ridiculous political ploy" unrelated to the campaign. "An extra has about as much influence on a production as a fly has on growing a tree," he said. "They have no real say, they’re just there." Lynn Comella, a UNLV gender and sexuality studies professor, said use of the term "fetish film" seemed politically charged. Comella said in an email that she didn’t watch the film, but that the somewhat convoluted plot touched on a number of sexual fetishes and serious issues such as animal roleplay, human trafficking and organ harvesting. "I don't think it's necessarily wrong to describe it as a fetish film, but it's clear that this word is being used to pack a political punch," she said in an email. "It's clear that they are attempting to establish some kind of connection between this person's appearance in a fetish film — if we want to call it that — and stalking, which is specious at best." Stalking The campaign mail cites an article from NewsMaxTV Las Vegas, an online news site run by Republican political operative Rob Lauer. Lauer is known for an unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state and having his home searched by police in 2015 as part of a wide-ranging extortion investigation into a Nevada Assemblyman. The article claims Silberkraus was detained by police in handcuffs for "stalking" his primary opponent. But Silberkraus was never charged with or convicted of stalking. Las Vegas police said they had no records on file for an arrest or any incident involving Silberkraus, and a search of national and local court document sites revealed nothing filed against Silberkraus. The stalking claim originates with three-time state Assembly candidate Amy Groves, who most recently lost a June 2016 Republican primary contest to Silberkraus by 253 votes. Groves told PolitiFact that she called police after seeing Silberkraus taking pictures of a home she owns outside the Assembly district where she had filed to run. Silberkraus said he was attempting to collect evidence that Groves lived in that home outside the district, which would disqualify her from running. A handful of legislative candidates have been removed from the ballot in recent years after their opponents were able to prove that they didn’t live in the district. Groves said she felt threatened because as a realtor, she was often responsible for evicting residents or overseeing collections, and said she felt threatened enough to call the police. "We really panicked because it’s a real threat in my industry," she said. Groves’ husband blocked in Silberkraus’ vehicle with his own car, and police questioned him for several minutes before letting him go. Silberkraus said he never felt like he was being detained, and that the photo in the ad was cropped to make it look like he was handcuffed. "I’ve never been handcuffed in my life," he said. Regardless, police have no arrest record or any record of Silberkraus being detained, and Groves said she didn’t keep copies of any paperwork she filed with police about the incident. Our ruling A campaign mailer in a competitive Nevada Assembly race accuses Silberkraus of appearing in a "sexual fetish film" and being detained for "stalking." Silberkraus did appear briefly as an extra in a 2006 movie that centered around a myriad of sexual fetishes. He says he doesn’t agree with the film’s message. The stalking allegation holds less water, stemming from a primary opponent who accused him of stalking her several years ago. No official record exists, and he was not arrested. The claim contains an element of truth but distorts facts to create an inaccurate impression.

pomt-12268	Says the manager of a Checkers in Miami Gardens, Fla., killed 10 employees.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/channel24newscom/story-about-checkers-shooting-came-fake-news-gener/	An online post that said the manager of a fast food restaurant killed 10 employees was created by a fake news generator apparently devised as a prank. An undated post on Channel24News.com under the headline, "Manager killed 10 employees at checkers on 183st and 27ave," is only two sentences long. The page’s source code said it was published on June 22, 2017. "10:30 pm last night police received a call about gun fire in Miami Gardens. Manager killed 10 employees because they was stealing money and tons of supplies," it read. It was illustrated with the photo of a Checkers restaurant at 2645 NW 183rd St in Miami Gardens, Fla., between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. As of this writing, the post was shared almost 2,700 times. The post is fake, because every post from Channel24News.com is fake. It’s a website designed to allow users to create their own stories, whether they are real or not (presumably not). You should be able to note that right away, thanks to the Yao Ming meme cartoon at the page header, accompanied by the words, "You Got Owned!" A note on the righthand side of the website reads, "You've Been Pranked! Now Create A Story & Trick Your Friends!" Clicking on the button allows a user to write a headline and body text, and upload a photograph to illustrate it. The site generates a url that people can then send to people in an effort to convince them it’s real. The site nominally advises people to be smart about what they create, noting in its footer, "We do NOT support FAKE NEWS!!! This is a Prank website that is intended for Fun. Bullying, Violent Threats or posts that Violate Public Order are NOT permitted on this Website." Of course, a "prank" about a shooting at a fast food restaurant is a bit on the violent side, but as of this writing the Checkers story had not been removed. The site is registered to a Korry Scherer in Milwaukee, Wis. We attempted to reach Scherer at the contact information provided (there’s none on the site) but didn’t hear back. We didn’t find a record of a mass shooting at a Miami Gardens Checkers, although a man was shot and killed at another location in the town in 2015.

pomt-12219	"We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-not-close-claiming-he-has-signed-more/	On "Made in America Day," so proclaimed by President Donald Trump, the president hopped into the driver’s seat of a Wisconsin-made fire truck that was parked on the White House lawn. "Where’s the fire?" he joked. "Put it out fast." Products from all 50 states were showcased, including the truck made by Pierce Manufacturing in Appleton. During the July 17, 2017 ceremony, Trump made some remarks, including a claim about his productivity. Referring to Vice President Mike Pence, who was standing behind him, Trump said: In just a few months and moments, I will say what we’ve done over a short period of time and what we’re going to be doing over the next six months will be incredible. We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever. For a while, Harry Truman had us, and now I think we have everybody, Mike. I better say "think," otherwise they’ll give me a Pinocchio -- (laughter) -- and I don’t like those -- I don’t like Pinocchios. The data In April 2017, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, Trump had signed 28 bills into law. That was the most since the 55 signed into law by Democratic President Harry Truman in 1949, after Truman was elected to his first full term. But, despite his claim on his 178th day in office, Trump is behind a number of presidents over the past several decades, according to GovTrack.us, a website that tracks Congress. President, party, year took office Bills signed into law through 178 days in office Dwight Eisenhower, R, 1953 228 John F. Kennedy, D, 1961 200 Jimmy Carter, D, 1977 70 Richard Nixon, R, 1969 64 George H.W. Bush, R, 1989 55 Bill Clinton, D, 1993 50 Donald Trump, R, 2017 42 Bills signed by Trump include one that’s meant to restore faith in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and several that roll back Obama-era regulations, including some that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing. But it’s also worth noting that most of the laws with Trump’s signature are not major pieces of legislation, as PolitiFact National has reported. They include, among others: two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee. (Trump’s Pinocchio reference, by the way, was to the rating system used by our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker.) Our rating Trump said: "We’ve signed more bills -- and I’m talking about through the legislature -- than any president ever." The 42 bills he had signed into law through 178 days in office trails the number signed by at least six other presidents at that point in their presidencies. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-08947	"In Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/23/ted-strickland/ted-stricklands-claim-about-increased-school-fundi/	Gov. Ted Strickland has long campaigned on being a champion of education, even going so far as to inject himself into the landmark school funding decision in Ohio back when he was a congressman. So it’s no surprise that the Democratic governor is peppering his campaign speeches with references to increasing school funding. For example, in a July 6, 2010, speech in Columbus, Strickland lamented funding cuts done in several other states before saying "in Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget." The claim is such a popular theme with Strickland, we decided to look more closely at his assertion. While it’s true that the total pot of money going to funding primary and secondary schools in Ohio will grow by 5.5 percent during the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011, it’s not state aid that is responsible for the hike. State aid to schools will actually be lower by about $32 million--from $6.542 billion in 2009 to $6.510 billion in 2011. On a district-by-district level, that means about 60 percent of the more than 600 school districts in Ohio will get less money for operations in the current two-year budget cycle than they did before. Instead, it’s federal money, including stimulus funding dollars which makes the statewide school funding pie bigger. And a large portion of the federal funding for primary and secondary education must be funneled into very specific programs such as $922 million statewide in combined federal Title I and IDEA funding. Title I money must be spent on things like additional teachers, intervention specialists for low-income students. IDEA funds must be spent on the education of special needs children. The natural impression left by the governor’s words "we invested in our children, increasing school funding" is that Ohio’s state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohio’s children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland. We find the governor’s claim to be False. Comment on this item.

pomt-12309	Although California has "the sixth largest economy in the world, we also have one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation.	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jun/22/antonio-villaraigosa/does-california-have-6th-largest-economy-world-and/	Before announcing his bid for California governor in November 2016, Antonio Villaraigosa said he went "up and down this state" on a listening tour. The former mayor of Los Angeles said he witnessed markers of the state’s economic vitality and also its extreme poverty. "What I saw was two Californias," Villaraigosa said at the forum, hosted on June 6, 2017 in San Francisco by the Public Policy Institute of California. Villaraigosa then made a statement that included two bold claims PolitiFact California has examined individually in the past. "What people don’t realize about California is that although we have the sixth largest economy in world, we have one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation, Villaraigosa said at the event. Villaraigosa makes his claim at about the 6:45 minute mark in this video by the Public Policy Institute of California. We’ll revisit our analysis on those claims below. First, here’s some background on Villaraigosa and the 2018 California governor’s race. Governor’s race Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing in 2018 to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others already announced include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include State Assemblyman Travis Allen of Orange County; John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a Hall of Fame professional football player. A poll released in June 2017 showed a tightening race. Newsom was in the lead among all candidates, with 22 percent support from likely voters. Villaraigosa had 17 percent support, up from his 11 percent three months earlier. As part of our Tracking The Truth series, PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 governor’s race. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. We’ve already checked one of Villaraigosa’s statements at the June 6, 2017 forum. He made the False claim that California is currently home to one-quarter of the nation’s 300 poorest cities. He mischaracterized the results of a study, which relied on data from 2013, when many of the state’s cities had not yet recovered from the Great Recession. Today, many of those same cities have experienced strong economic improvement. Sixth largest economy in the world? Turning to Villaraigosa’s bold claim involving the economy and poverty, we’ll start by checking the first part: that California has the "sixth largest economy in the world." This is a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages. We fact-checked this hypothetical comparison of the state’s economy against that of nations in July 2016 when State Senate Leader Kevin de León made the same assertion at the Democratic National Convention. We rated it Mostly True based on California’s 2.4 trillion GDP in 2015, which ranked sixth behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom and slightly above France and Brazil. The rankings came from the Brown Administration, which analyzed figures from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database. The claim missed a completely True rating because it ignored California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s outsized role in the state’s economic growth, which speaks to Villaraigosa’s description of unequal economies across the state. In a separate set of rankings, the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, reported in 2016 that the state’s GDP ranking dropped to 11th in the world. That placed it just below France and just above Mexico. The Brown Administration, not including cost of living, recently updated the GDP rankings for 2016. California’s now $2.60 trillion GDP remained in the sixth spot, though it was just a tick behind the United Kingdom’s $2.62 trillion economy. Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate, but needs the same clarification about the state’s high cost of living. One of the highest poverty rates? The second part of Villaraigosa’s claim is that California has one of the "highest poverty rates." We interpreted this to mean compared with other states in the nation. We know the state has struggled mightily with poverty. As an example, we rated True a claim by Republican Assembly Leader Chad Mayes in January that California has "the highest poverty rate in the nation" when comparing states and considering cost-of-living. At 20.6 percent, California’s poverty rate in 2015 was well above the national average of 15.1 percent, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report that factors in cost-of-living. Florida’s 19 percent poverty rate ranked second. Unlike Mayes’ statement on poverty, however, Villaraigosa’s claim makes no mention of cost-of-living. Ignoring this factor, California would have the 17th highest poverty rate, not the first, according to the census bureau. Villaraigosa’s statement needs this key clarification. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed California has "the sixth largest economy in the world" and one of the highest poverty rates" in the nation. The facts show Villaraigosa was correct on both points. He omitted, however, the key point that California’s high cost-of-living drags down its economic output and accelerates its poverty. The candidate for governor’s statements would benefit from this additional information. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-08389	Lizbeth Benacquisto "broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/24/kevin-rader/florida-house-candidate-lizabeth-benaquist-accused/	It seems like every other ad on television is a campaign attack. It must be election season. One advertisement that caught our attention was a claim by District 27 state Senate candidate Kevin Rader against his Republican opponent Lizbeth Benacquisto. Rader beat Democratic opponent Pete Burkert by about 1,000 votes in the Aug. 24, 2010, primary election. Rader and Benacquisto are vying for the seat vacated by Dave Aronberg, who lost the Democratic primary for attorney general in August. The district runs from Republican-heavy Lee County through rural Glades and Hendry counties and into Democratic-heavy Palm Beach County. During a recent television ad, Rader attacks Benacquisto for 105 Florida election law violations. The advertisement, which features a picture of Benacquisto and mathematical symbols and equations, includes this: "Let’s do the math on Lizbeth Benacquisto. She broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors. She claims she’s a tax cutter, but on city council, she repeatedly raised taxes and fees, totaling a 52 percent tax increase. One hundred five ethics violations; 52 percent tax increase. We can’t afford Lizbeth Benacquisto, or believe her." That seems like a large number of violations, so we wanted to put Rader’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter test. The source for the ad is a Palm Beach Post article published April 9, 2006, and written by Dwayne Robinson. The article focuses on Wellington village council members and their myriad mistakes in campaign record filings during the March 14, 2006, municipal election in Palm Beach County. Benacquisto was elected vice mayor with more than 56 percent of the vote over challengers Julio Galvez and Jean Lexima. The Rader ad focuses on an allegation against Benacquisto that in more than 105 instances, her reports excluded the occupations of donors giving more than $100 to her campaign. The article states many of those donors "were developers, builders, Big Sugar and other special interests." Florida law requires each report to contain the full name, address and occupation of anyone who has made a contribution, along with amount and date of such contribution. Mercedes Kelly, then Benacquisto’s campaign treasurer, told the Post she started including contributors’ occupations at the beginning of the campaign, but trailed off as the money came in. She admitted to being overwhelmed and said she would be filing an addendum with the complete information. According to 2006 campaign finance reports, Benacquisto filed addendums, writing by hand each person’s occupation for two filing periods, January through mid February and mid February through March. There were indeed builders and farmers, but also housewives, retirees and veterinarians. This was a situation where the same error was made 105 times, not 105 different types of errors. Still, Benacquisto had 108 contributors for 2006, so missing occupations on 105 of them meant nearly all her donors were not listed correctly. For a third filing period, in 2005 but part of the same election cycle, no addendum was filed. In that 2005 period, occupations weren’t listed for 53 of the 78 contributors. The 2006 article points out that during a 2002 village election, Benacquisto had no election law errors and fully reported donors’ occupations. Since the municipal election was four years ago and the omissions were publicized, we were curious how Benacquisto was doing this time. We looked at her filings for the 2010 Senate race. We found that of 673 contributions to Benacquisto so far this year, 150 times the occupation isn’t listed, according to information on the Florida Division of Elections website. In fairness, we’ll note that in Rader’s last report, for the period of Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, he also fails to list occupation 14 times among the 104 donors, according to the state Division of Elections website. Florida Election Commission Clerk Patsy Rushing said on Oct. 21 that no complaints have been filed against Benacquisto in this race. We’ll leave it up to you to determine whether there’s intent to leave off contributors’ names or just sloppiness by the campaign. But as for the truth of the matter, we rate Rader’s claim that Benacquisto "broke election law 105 times" as True.	None	Kevin Rader	None	None	None	2010-10-24T05:28:18	2010-10-20	['None']

pomt-12274	Since he and Scott Walker took office in 2011, "60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/05/paul-soglin/madison-mayor-understates-wisconsin-job-growth-ove/	While being interviewed about whether he will run against Gov. Scott Walker in 2018, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin seized on an issue that Walker has tried to own: jobs. Soglin, who served as Madison’s mayor twice before, dating back to the 1970s, began his third stint at City Hall in April 2011. Walker had taken office as governor in January of that year. On the June 18, 2017 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a talk show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Soglin contrasted himself with Walker on how best to create jobs. And he suggested Madison is responsible for most new jobs in the state, saying: I happen to believe that the public works in partnership and that means public investment. That’s what’s happened in Madison. We have invested in education, we have invested in infrastructure. That creates jobs. But more importantly, it creates private investment. And if you look at the Madison tax rolls, if you look at the population growth, if you look at the fact that when Governor Walker and I both took office in 2011, within three months of one another, 60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area. Clearly, we’re doing something right. And that’s not the state government or the university growing, because the governor’s cut those back. So, Soglin is referring to private-sector jobs. We wondered whether the 60,000 figure was accurate and whether Madison and the surrounding area created two-thirds of the new jobs in Wisconsin over the past seven years. Jobs, not labor force Soglin told us he based his claim on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian labor force. But that’s not a count of jobs. The labor force is the number of people who are employed plus the number who are unemployed and looking for work. Other BLS figures show a much larger increase in jobs than Soglin claimed and that the Madison area does not account for two-thirds of them. The seasonally adjusted figures show there were 2,330,000 nonfarm private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in April 2011 and 2,539,900 jobs in May 2017, the latest figures available. That’s an increase of 209,900 jobs. For the Madison area, the seasonally adjusted figures are available only for total non-farm jobs -- meaning public and private sector jobs added together. There were 361,100 jobs in April 2011 and 401,900 in May 2017. That’s an increase of 40,800. But, again, that’s counting public sector and private sector jobs, when Soglin was citing only private sector jobs. So, the Madison area produced far less than two-thirds of the new private-sector jobs. As for the labor force, the measure Soglin cited, there were 3,062,326 people either employed or unemployed and looking for work in Wisconsin in April 2011. In May 2017, the figure was 3,136,701. (These figures are not seasonally adjusted.) That’s an increase of 74,375. The figures for the Madison area (April 2017 is the latest available) were 359,132 and 389,259, an increase of 30,127. That means the Madison area accounted for about 40 percent, not two-thirds, of the increase in the labor force. Our rating Soglin says that since he and Walker took office in 2011, "60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area." But Soglin was citing figures for the number of people in the labor force -- that is, people who are employed plus people who are unemployed but looking for jobs. That’s not a count of jobs. The actual net increase in jobs in Wisconsin, comparing April 2011 versus May 2017, is much higher: 209,900. And the Madison area accounted for less than half of the increase. We rate Soglin’s statement False.	None	Paul Soglin	None	None	None	2017-07-05T05:00:00	2017-06-18	['Madison,_Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-09655	The Senate health care bill does not contain limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/02/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-gets-it-right-medical-malpractice-reform/	Republicans have a lot of concerns about the Senate health care bill, and one of their biggest is that it does not include any language to rein in lawsuits against doctors. On Day 2 of the chamber's health care debate, Republican leader Mitch McConnell spoke about the issue on the Senate floor as he encouraged colleagues to send the bill back to committees for some major changes. "Then we could start over and end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs, something the majority didn’t find any room for in their 2,074-page bill — not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals," McConnell said Dec. 1, 2009. That claim has been echoed by other conservatives, including Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer. Their argument for limiting malpractice cases or their awards — supporters call it "tort reform" — involves saving money. If doctors are not scared of being sued, they're less likely to order unnecessary tests and procedures for their patients, thus reducing medical costs. Indeed, a Congressional Budget Office report from 2004 says health care premiums have risen recently in part "because insurance companies have faced increased costs to pay for claims (from growth in malpractice awards)." More recently, the independent budget office said that medical malpractice reform could save up to $54 billion over the next 10 years. President Barack Obama addressed the issue at a June meeting of the American Medical Association, saying, "I recognize that it will be hard to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they're constantly looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits. ... I understand some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable." Nevertheless, Obama said malpractice awards should not be capped, as many Republicans want, because he believes the caps can be unfair to people who are wrongfully harmed. Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, a physician, gave some insight into the issue when it came up in a Virginia town hall meeting last summer. "Here's why tort reform is not in the bill: When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that the more stuff you put in it the more enemies you make," Dean said. "The reason tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everyone else they were taking on, and that is the plain and simple truth." So, Democrats have not included medical malpractice limits in either the House or Senate version of the bills. Instead, the administration has said it will give some states $3 million grants to test new approaches for limiting lawsuits. The two bills don't completely ignore the issue. The Senate bill includes nonbinding "sense of the Senate" language on page 1,858 that "states should be encouraged to develop and test alternatives to the existing civil litigation system as a way of improving patient safety, reducing medical errors, encouraging the efficient resolution of disputes ... while preserving an individual's right to seek redress in court." The House bill establishes an incentive for states to adopt alternatives to traditional malpractice lawsuits, but those proposals cannot include provisions to limit attorney fees or impose caps on damages. So, back to McConnell's claim. He said that the Senate bill does not include limits on medical malpractice litigation, and he is clearly correct. We rate his claim True.

pomt-02727	"There never really was a 'Hastert Rule.' "	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/19/dennis-hastert/hastert-there-was-no-hastert-rule/	One of the guiding principles for Republicans in the House of Representatives is that no bill comes up for a vote unless a majority of Republican members support it. It’s called the "Hastert Rule," after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert who held the post from 1999 to 2007. The Hastert Rule got a lot of attention during the government shutdown. Democrats said the House could have broken the logjam sooner if they had been allowed to vote on a bill that would have pulled in about 30 Republican members. Current Speaker John Boehner would have none of it. But the namesake of the rule now says no rule, in fact, exists. "There never really was a 'Hastert Rule'," Hastert said Wedneday on MSNBC’s The Cycle. He said the "rule" was just a statement of common sense. "If you're a leader of the House and you need to go to the other side of the aisle to move your agenda, you give up a lot of power and leadership," Hastert said. "The real Hastert Rule (was) you didn't bring a bill to the floor unless you had 214 votes." We wanted to address two issues in this fact-check. Is there an actual rule? And if not, why is everyone acting like there is one? Donald Wolfensberger, who spent 28 years as a House staffer and now directs the Congress Project at the Wilson Center, said there is no official Hastert Rule. "It was neither a House rule nor a Republican conference rule, and certainly not a matter of law nor enforceable by point of order or caucus sanction," Wolfensberger said. "As Hastert put it, it is a commonsense rule of thumb." In fact, Boehner himself has deviated from the Hastert Rule without consequence. In January, the House passed $50.7 billion in federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims with a majority of Republicans in opposition. A majority of Republicans also voted no on a January 2013 fiscal cliff deal that passed the House. The Hastert Rule, essentially, is popular shorthand for a tactic to prevent political embarrassment. In the rough and tumble of House politics, Wolfensberger said, the leader of the majority party would be naive to count on help from the minority to get a bill passed. "It may be hard to believe but the minority sometimes takes delight in leaving the majority high and wet on the losing end of a vote on a matter that was supposed to have had bipartisan support," Wolfensberger said. Its origins likely stem from the GOP takeover of the House in 1995, said Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College. Before then, Republicans had not controlled the House since President Dwight Eisenhower was in office. "Old-style Republicans had been in the minority so long, they worked with the majority on the theory that part of a loaf was better than nothing," Fowler said. "Gingrich and others like him were scornful of such accommodation." Hastert says the term that bears his name originiated during a contentious vote on immigration policy in 2006. A reporter asked him why he wouldn’t move forward with help from Democrats. "You don't really want to move anything unless you have the solid base of your party along with you," Hastert explained. Chicago Sun Times Washington bureau chief Lynn Sweet tracked it back to a 2003 speech by Hastert where he outlined his guidelines as speaker. "My fifth principle is to please the majority of your majority," Hastert said. As Hastert said on MSNBC, it was all about holding on to power within his own party. A rule without a capital R The record is clear that the principle known as the Hastert Rule never had any formal standing. But the record is full of moments when politicians, staffers and journalists used the phrase. In March, Rep. David Schweikert, R- Ariz., urged his colleagues to "honor the Hastert Rule and bring bills to the floor that enjoy majority support among our conference." In September, a spokesman for Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D- Ill., said "The Hastert Rule basically means that 118 Republicans have to agree on immigration reform before the whole House can consider it." A Nexis search produced nearly 100 references to the Hastert Rule in newspapers since 2004. According to Nexis, the first instance was in November 2004 when Los Angeles Times reporter Richard Brownstein wrote about Hastert: "One of his guiding principles has been that no bill should pass the House unless it has support not only from an overall majority but from a majority of Republicans. Call it the Hastert Rule." An interesting, but worthwhile aside. For a brief time, members of Congress referred to a different "Hastert Rule." In May 2004, we found instances of people talking about the Hastert Rule in terms of members of Congress being able to raise the nation’s debt ceiling without voting on a standalone measure (the idea being to make life easier for members of Congress). The mechanism had been called the Gephardt Rule after former Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., but when Hastert became speaker, Democrats changed the "rule’s" name. Our ruling Hastert said there never was a Hastert Rule. As a formal rule, adopted by the Republican Conference or the House Rules Committee, that is accurate. Boehner himself broke the Hastert rule at least twice in 2013 and suffered no consequences. Yet, the Hastert Rule has become shorthand for a belief popular among Republicans that has no-doubt shaped GOP policy in the past and present. And Boehner could face consequences from his Republican caucus if he continued to violate the rule -- namely losing his speakership. In that sense, the Hastert Rule has become a little akin to common law among the GOP. Hastert has a technical point but glosses over some important caveats. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03341	"We’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply. We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/21/scott-walker/americas-dairyland-needs-import-10-its-milk-gov-sc/	For two decades, America’s Dairyland has suffered the indignity of being outmilked by, sheesh, California. Now comes word that our cows don’t even produce enough milk for Wisconsin -- more needs to be brought in from other states. The Badger State, since being eclipsed by California in milk production in 1993, has had time to cope with being No. 2. But Bucky apparently still wants to fight. On July 10, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker spoke to reporters in Dallas, Wis. (pop. 409), at Wisconsin Farm Technology Days, which is billed as one of the largest agricultural shows in the nation. He said it is important that Wisconsin dairy farmers increase milk production to meet the demands of the state’s dairy plants. "A lot of people don’t realize that we’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply," Walker said, according to The Country Today, a newspaper that covers rural life in Wisconsin and Minnesota. "We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers." Do we really have to import about 10 percent of our milk? Walker’s evidence At the ag show, Walker talked up the state agriculture department's 30X20 program, which gives grants of up to $5,000 to dairy producers toward a goal of generating 30 billion pounds of milk per year statewide by 2020. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor based his claim on hard numbers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as two assumptions. As we'll see, the government does not track milk "imports," or rather the shipment of milk across state lines. So, the two assumptions Walker makes are critical in evaluating his statement. Figures from the USDA show Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk in 2012. (That was up 4 percent from 2011 and is a record for Wisconsin, according to the USDA.) From there, Walker does some calculations. He assumes, as it is widely held in dairy circles, that 90 percent of milk produced in Wisconsin is used to make cheese, as opposed to being bottled or used to make foods such as ice cream and yogurt. That would mean 24.5 billion pounds of Wisconsin milk was available for cheese making. Walker's other assumption is a rule of thumb -- cited by Wisconsin cheese industry folks and others, such as Harvard University -- that it takes about 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese. So, dividing the 24.5 billion pounds of milk by 10 would mean there was enough Wisconsin milk to make 2.45 billion pounds of cheese in 2012. But federal figures show Wisconsin actually produced more than that -- 2.79 billion pounds of cheese (tops in the United States). That's a difference of 340 million pounds of cheese. Put another way, it would mean Wisconsin cheese makers needed to import 3.4 billion pounds of milk to produce all of the cheese they made in 2012. And 3.4 billion pounds of milk amounts to 12.5 percent of the 27.2 billion total pounds of milk produced in Wisconsin in 2012. So, by Walker's figuring, his 10 percent claim is actually conservative. That's a start. Let’s hear from some experts. Other evidence John Umhoefer, executive director of the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association in Madison, cited slightly older federal figures, from 2011, which he said comprise the latest complete data-set available. He also used the two assumptions Walker did. Wisconsin produced 26.1 billion pounds of milk in 2011 -- which, using the 10-pound rule of thumb, was enough for about 2.61 billion pounds of cheese. But Wisconsin cheese makers actually made 2.64 billion pounds of cheese in 2011. So, using round numbers, if 90 percent of Wisconsin milk gets used for cheese, but cheese making accounts for all of the Wisconsin milk produced (and a little more), that means there's at least a 10 percent milk shortfall. That additional milk had to come from some other state, if it didn’t come from Wisconsin. James Robson, chief executive officer of the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, which works to increase the sale and consumption of Wisconsin milk and dairy products, told us Wisconsin has had a milk production shortfall for all 12 years that he has headed the Madison-based board. He said the efficiency of Wisconsin milk production has increased the past several years, but that consumers' demand for cheese has increased even more, creating the need for milk from out of state. (Wisconsin’s more than 1.2 million dairy cows produced 21,436 pounds of milk per cow in 2012, up 4 percent from 2011.) "Some of our cheese makers bring in milk from as far away as Texas," Robson said. He is also relying, however, on the two key assumptions Walker made. What about those? Ed Jesse, an emeritus agricultural and applied economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the first thing to know about milk shortfalls or imports is that the government does not track the shipment of milk between states. So, any statement about the amount of milk brought into Wisconsin is an estimate. As for the two assumptions, Jesse said they have long been widely quoted and he doesn't necessarily argue with them, but that they aren't rock-solid, either. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of some cheeses, but less milk for others. And while it's often said 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is used for cheese making, that could be a "rural myth" but "it’s probably not far off," Jesse said. Indeed, even the Milk Marketing Board hedges a bit, saying "as much as" 90 percent of Wisconsin milk is made into cheese. Our rating Walker said: "We’re importing about 10 percent of our milk supply. We’re America’s Dairyland, but yet we don’t have enough milk in this state to meet the demand for our cheesemakers." Walker's statement is on target, based on the best available estimates, but there aren't actual statistics on how much milk is shipped to Wisconsin from out of state. With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-07-21T20:08:14	2013-07-10	['None']
pomt-04316	Says New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-democrats-are-blame-private-se/	Just in time for Halloween, Gov. Chris Christie cautioned New Hampshire voters last week to avoid the "horror movie" that New Jerseyans have lived through. Here’s how the Republican governor summed up that film’s plot: Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending, leading the Garden State to lose private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009. "See, look at what happened to us. From 2000 to 2009, we had a jobless decade: more private-sector jobs in New Jersey on Jan. 1, 2000 than were there on Dec. 31, 2009," Christie said Wednesday at a campaign event for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. "A jobless decade under Democratic leadership, because what did they do?" the governor went on. "Raise taxes, increase regulation, raised fees, and during that period of time, spending went up an average of 16 percent a year." The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs, but he’s wrong to attribute that reduction only to tax and fee hikes, regulatory changes and state spending increases. Christie failed to note the impact of the recession, which coincided with the deepest losses of private-sector jobs. Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told us "the Governor’s comments are factual and the record of job loss AND economic malaise in the decade dominated by Democratic leaders, who raises taxes, fees and burdensome regulation, speaks for itself." First, let’s break down the job figures. According to seasonally adjusted figures from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state had 3,366,100 private-sector jobs in December 1999 and 3,211,100 in December 2009. That represents a net loss of 155,000 private-sector jobs over the decade. During the same time period, New Jersey gained 69,300 net jobs in the public-sector. But the bulk of the private-sector job losses occurred in 2008 and 2009 -- the height of the recession. The recession technically lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. After five consecutive years of private-sector job gains, New Jersey lost 107,900 jobs in 2008 and 117,000 in 2009. Harry Holzer, a professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and the chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton, called Christie’s comparison "extremely unfair." "It's an extremely unfair comparison, since Jan. 1 2000 was the peak of the late-90s boom and Dec. 31 2009 was close to the trough of a terrible recession," Holzer said in an e-mail. "There is no question that the recession contributed, and is likely the dominant effect," Holzer added. "When you go from the strongest labor market in the past 40 years to the weakest one in 80 years, there will be a lot of job loss, and that was true in every state in the country." But Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, told us another factor was how New Jersey’s private-sector job gains preceding the recession lagged behind the nation’s growth rate. "The reasons for that weak performance compared are complex, but they include the loss of competitiveness of the state in terms of attracting, retaining and growing private sector investment and employment," Seneca said in an e-mail. "How much of this loss in competitiveness was due to taxes, regulations, other business costs, and a perceived unfriendly business climate cannot be easily determined, but by the mid years of the decade this deterioration in competitiveness had manifested itself in weak job growth." Our ruling At a campaign event in New Hampshire last week, Christie claimed New Jersey lost private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2009 because Democrats increased taxes, fees, regulations and state spending. The governor’s right about the drop in private-sector jobs: New Jersey lost 155,000 jobs between December 1999 and December 2009. But the reasons behind those job losses are complex and Christie failed to acknowledge the impact of the recession, which coincided with the bulk of the job losses. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09959	The Democrats propose "a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/19/mike-pence/120-million-deprived-health-care-not-correct/	With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack. Obama and the Democratic leadership have proposed broad outlines for the overhaul. The centerpiece of their plan remains the employer-based system, where most people have private health insurance through work. To rein in costs, the government would invest in electronic medical records and encourage efficiency and preventive care. To get coverage for people who don't have health insurance, the plan would increase eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Finally, the plans seek to create a health insurance exchange, where individuals and small businesses can easily comparison shop for insurance coverage. One of the exchange plans would be a public option run by the government. It's the public option that has fueled Republican attacks, leading to charges that it would destroy the private system, that millions would lose their current coverage, and that Democrats don't have a way to pay for it. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana described the Democratic health care plan as "a government-controlled health care plan that will deprive roughly 120 million Americans of their current health care coverage and lead to federal bureaucrats denying critical care for patients." That "120 million" number jumped out at us. That's a big number, representing roughly three-quarters of those who now have employer-provided health insurance. We asked Pence's staff about the number, and they referred us to a report from the Lewin Group, a health care consulting firm. The report ran a number of scenarios, including what would happen if the government offered a public option that was a Medicare-style plan open to everyone. Their model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. But there's a hitch: That's what the Lewin Group believed would happen under the plans that were the most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. As we noted before, it's possible to set up a public option where only some people are allowed to enroll. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes like a private insurer, the number drops further. We'll grant that Congress could come up with a Medicare-style plan and open it to everyone, but it doesn't seem likely. Pence appears to be picking the worst number he can choose. And he doesn't mention the fact that under the scenario laid out by the Lewin Group, people would still have health care coverage and their premiums reduced by 30 to 40 percent. He says the government would "deprive" people of health insurance, when actually the scenario is that they would choose a different option. Even if you believe that an expansive government health care plan would drive private insurers out of business, that still doesn't account for Pence's "deprive" claim, because the Lewin report he cites is focused on people who have chosen the government plan, not people who were left to the government plan after private options disappeared. Finally, we have to include a caveat about the Lewin Group. The group says it operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance. Given all this background and explanation, we rated Pence's statement that the government would "deprive" 120 million people of their "current health care coverage" False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d3dff281-ba69-4fa7-b09c-de38ed52a748	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-05-19T18:34:44	2009-05-12	['United_States', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-00421	"It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-falsely-claims-jacksonville-shooter-/	In an attempt to find a motive behind a deadly shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., some conservative commentators misidentified the assailant as part of a political opposition movement against President Donald Trump. Syndicated talk show radio host Rush Limbaugh went a step further, predicting the story would quickly vanish from headlines because the mainstream media is wary of publicizing stories in which "the resistance is taking up arms" "I’m thinking you might not hear very much about this Jacksonville shooting after the preliminaries because it appears that the shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'," Limbaugh said Aug. 28, two days after two died and 10 others were injured in the incident. But Limbaugh’s claim is based on erroneous reporting, which has since been retracted. Gateway Pundit identifies wrong Reddit user Limbaugh’s comments were posted on his website, which linked to a story on the conspiracy-minded site Gateway Pundit. The original headline on the Gateway Pundit article read, "Jacksonville Shooter Was Member of Anti-Trump ‘Resistance’ – Referred to Trump Supporters at ‘Trumptards’ – Murdered 4 People." Gateway Pundit identified the shooter as operating with the Reddit handle "Ravenchamps," which posted comments critical of Trump and his supporters. However, the actual shooter’s video game handle was "Ravens2012champs," according to NBC News. TMZ reported he also used the name "RavensChamp" — one letter off from the user identified by Gateway Pundit. Gateway Pundit has since removed references to the wrongly identified Reddit user, and issued an update that says, "An anonymous Reddit user was mis-identified in an earlier post." The Gateway Pundit article now carries a different headline that strikes any reference to the shooter’s political leanings: "Jacksonville Shooter Had Strange Online Profile and Bizarre Playing Style – Murdered 3 People (UPDATE)." We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. At the time of this writing, the post on Limbaugh’s site remains uncorrected. Attempts to reach Limbaugh were unreturned. In an interview with NBC News, the wrongly identified Reddit user, who NBC referred to only as a Minnesota native named "Pavel" to protect his privacy, described his reaction to learning about the case of mistaken identity: "I went on Reddit. I noticed I had 60, 70 unread messages. Usually I have two or something," he told NBC News. "I look at the messages and it's a bunch of people using my username claiming I'm that Madden shooter person. Half of them are messages like 'I hope that person's dead.' Responding to a user who said "ravenchamps was his profile, see for yourself," Ravenchamps wrote back. "I'm alive you know?" he wrote. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "It appears that the (Jacksonville) shooter was part of the Trump 'Resistance'." Limbaugh’s comments were based on an article by the Gateway Pundit, which has since retracted its claim about the shooter’s anti-Trump political leanings. We searched through articles about the perpetrator and found no evidence the shooting was politically motivated. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that per NBC News, the shooter used the handle "Ravens2012champs" as a video game username, not a Reddit username.

pomt-05030	Says she "stood up to" Gov. Scott Walker on tax cuts "for wealthy corporations" while her congressional opponent voted with Walker.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/13/kelda-helen-roys/roys-says-pocan-voted-walker-favor-tax-cuts-wealth/	State Reps. Kelda Helen Roys and Mark Pocan united against Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining limits in 2011, but competition for a big promotion is creating friction between the two Madison Democrats. The two are seeking the Madison-area 2nd Congressional District seat, which is open because U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is running for the U.S. Senate. The all-important primary in the heavily Democratic district is Aug. 14, 2012. In the race, Roys is tagging Pocan as "caving" by voting with Walker on two pro-business bills. In pointed remarks at a July 9, 2012 news conference, Roys riffed about Walker’s "outrageous" series of "corporate tax giveaways for wealthy corporations -- some of them out of state." She said the Republican governor’s intent was to help his "deep pocketed friends." Then she went after Pocan. "Were we going to vote for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways or were we going to do the right thing for working families that need and rely on the public services we provide?" Roys asked. "On those votes, when it really mattered, Mark Pocan failed the judgment test by voting for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways." In a district that strongly opposed Walker in the failed June 2012 recall election, those are fighting words. Did Pocan help Walker deliver tax breaks for "wealthy corporations"? Roys singled Pocan out for votes on two bills in the January 2011 special session. She repeated the charge in a new TV ad, though without narrowing it to two bills, and without naming Pocan. --Assembly Bill 3, which wiped away two years of taxes for businesses that relocate to Wisconsin. Estimated price tag in lost tax revenue for the state treasury over two years: $1 million over two years. --Assembly Bill 4, which expanded the Economic Development Tax Credit program by $25 million, bringing it to $98.1 million. The credit can go to businesses that locate or retain corporate headquarters in Wisconsin, create jobs, make capital investments or train workers, the Journal Sentinel reported. Pocan did vote with the Republicans on both bills. But both bills attracted major support from Democrats in the Assembly, passing with 82-12 majorities. In other words, Pocan joined about two-thirds of the Democratic caucus in the Assembly in voting "yes." Roys was opposed, decrying aid to out-of-state firms while existing businesses paid full freight, and calling the Economic Development Tax Credit expansion unnecessary. She said she thinks Pocan "caved" because "people want to give Walker the benefit of the doubt and don’t want to be tagged as anti jobs." Pocan, a small business owner, defends the bills as modest efforts of the kind that Roys herself has supported in the past -- as she did in 2009 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, when Pocan was co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee. Pocan also noted the bills had minimal impact on the state’s 2011-’13 deficit. At the time of the vote, fiscal analysts predicted that none of the $25 million in additional tax credits would be claimed during the two years, because the fund was flush, as we noted in an earlier item. The other bill had a $1 million price tag over the two years. What about the other bills in the special session? Roys specified two, but also referred to a "series." Roys did not mention the biggest tax-break bill in that session: Assembly Bill 7, a much modified version of Walker’s push to give small businesses a tax break. In the end, the bill gave both mom-and-pop businesses and large corporations an estimated collective income tax break of $33.5 million a year -- tied to how many jobs they create. It passed 60-33 in the Assembly, with only three Democrats joining the GOP majority. Pocan did buck Walker on that one, as did Roys. Finally, Roys said the two were aimed at helping "wealthy corporations." But neither tax credit program is limited to larger businesses. Our rating Roys said Pocan caved by supporting Walker’s tax breaks "for wealthy corporations" while she stood in opposition. Pocan did vote for two bills that potentially could help large corporations cut their tax bills, so she is partially on target. But she leaves out important details that change the picture. Pocan opposed a much bigger-ticket tax break bill in the same session, and the two he backed helped small businesses as well as large corporations. What’s more, two-thirds of Democrats in the Assembly backed the bills -- and Roys herself is a past supporter of one of the programs. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-04372	Says House Democrats "voted to use your tax dollars for abortions" by voting against bill defunding Planned Parenthood.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/21/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-claims-tax-dollars-abortions-support/	Animosity between Planned Parenthood and anti-abortion activists has spilled over into Tennessee politics for years during an ongoing dispute over the use of federal funds, distributed by the state Department of Health, to pay for providing women's health services in the state's two largest counties. In the current campaign season, the Tennessee Republican Party has reached back to a 2009 state House vote on the so-called "defunding" of Planned Parenthood, targeting Democrats who voted against Republican-sponsored measure, in direct-mail advertising attacks. A mailer directed at former state Rep. Eddie Yokley, D-Greeneville, provides perhaps the strongest example. "Did you know Eddie Yokley voted to use your tax dollars for abortions?" the mailer asks in a large headline. The question is answered with another line saying the Democrat "supported taxpayer funded abortions" and an arrow pointing to a copy of a House roll call vote June 17, 2009, on HB1756 with Yokley's name circled on the list of 'no' votes. The state Democratic Party cried foul over this, declaring the mailer claim "shameless." Brandon Puttbrese, the Democrats' communication director, pointed out that state law forbids use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and that the funds in question are not used for abortions. A Republican rejoinder came from Adam Nickas, executive director of the state GOP: "Eddie Yokley had an opportunity to vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of abortions, but chose not to," Nickas said in an email. "We're not surprised Eddie Yokley is trying to squirm his way out of this one. We stand by our statement." The bill in question, HB1756, deals with what are known as federal "Title X" funds, distributed to states for "family planning services," including contraception, annual exams, Pap tests, screening for sexually transmitted disease and the like. As amended before passage, the bill did not go as far as anti-abortion activists wanted and basically called for the commissioner of health to give preference to county health departments as recipients of the funds over contracting the services out, which is how Planned Parenthood received the money in Shelby and Davidson counties. The Title X funds, then, do not go directly to fund abortions. There's no real dispute about that. The argument comes with contentions that the money indirectly supports Planned Parenthood's abortion services, which the organization contends are completely separate. Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, for example, has called the funding "a pro-abortion shell game." He and others say putting money into one Planned Parenthood program, women's health services, frees up money for other services. It's worth nothing that the wording is toned down somewhat in other GOP mailings. For example, a mailer attacking Rep. Charles Curtiss, D-Sparta, puts it this way: "Charlie Curtiss voted to send our tax dollars to the largest abortion provider in America." Further, a follow-up Republican attack mailer aimed at Yokley, has this wording: "Eddie Yokley supported Planned Parenthood and opposed a measure that would have prevented them from receiving your tax dollars." In any case, the bill, which was in a milder form than subsequent years’ versions and had no real impact on funding of Planned Parenthood, did not involve funding of abortions – certainly not any direct taxpayer payments for them. Without getting into all the developments on this issue since that 2009 vote, we would note the distinction between Planned Parenthood's many services not related to abortion and its well-known role as an abortion provider was a key part of a 2011 battle in Shelby County over Title X funding. The Shelby County Commission ultimately voted – in accord with the 2011 version of defunding legislation – to take funding away from Planned Parenthood and instead have Christ Community Health Services provide family-planning services to low-income citizens. In the process, abortion opponents also argued that giving Planned Parenthood money for any purpose frees up other funds and indirectly supports abortions. Our ruling A Tennessee Republican Party mailer claims that by voting against a 2009 bill aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood, Democrats were in effect allowing tax dollars to be used directly for abortions. That goes further than even current mainstream Republican dogma that allowing any funding of Planned Parenthood’s family-planning and women’s health initiatives helps indirectly fund abortions.

"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/03/viral-image/no-denali-not-kenyan-word-black-power/	Critics of President Barack Obama’s decision to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America’s tallest mountain say the move is insulting to a great president from Ohio. Anonymous social media critics point to a more hidden motive in the mountain’s new name, Denali. One image circulating on Facebook accused the president of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration, claiming that " ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ " The meme’s claim is so ridiculous that you wonder if it’s just a bad joke. To start, "Kenyan" is not a language. The two official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili. Neither of those languages are exclusive to one country, as Swahili is also spoken in a number of different African nations. A search of multiple Swahili dictionaries turned up no results for the word "Denali." As our fact-checker friends at Snopes found, the Swahili word for "black" is "mweusi," and the Swahili word for power is "nguvu." That doesn’t amount to "Denali," which has roots in the word "Deenaalee" in Koyukon, a native language of Alaska currently spoken by just 300 people. Koyukon is part of the Athabaskan language family, which also includes Navajo and several Apache languages native to the American Southwest. "Deenaalee" approximately translates to "the High One," according to James Fall, an official at Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, and James Kari, a linguist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Native Language Center. Obama called the name change "a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives." While the meme’s claim is ridiculous, we were able to verify that the viral image does depict the real Denali. Our ruling The meme claims " ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ " Nope. The word "Denali" doesn’t show up in Swahili, one of Kenya’s two national languages. Instead, it’s Koyukon Athabaskan for "high" or "tall."

pomt-07148	Then-Sen. Barack Obama "refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/14/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-obama-voted-against-debt-limit-when-/	Michele Bachmann said she would not support increasing the debt ceiling if it didn't include major reductions in government spending. "I've already voted no on raising the debt ceiling in the past. And unless there are serious cuts, I can't," she said at debate June 13, 2011, in New Hampshire. Bachmann is seeking the 2012 Republican nomination for president. "But I want to speak to someone that's far more eloquent than I," she continued. "Someone who said just dealing with the issue of raising the debt ceiling is a failure of leadership. That person was then Senator Barack Obama. He refused to raise the debt ceiling because he said President Bush had failed in leadership." We decided to fact-check Bachmann's to see if she was right. We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the U.S. Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged. The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but said it needs to be raised by August for the government to keep up with its obligations. Experts have warned that failure to raise the limit could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets, but Republicans have vowed to oppose the increase unless it's accompanied by spending cuts. Closed-door negotiations, led by Vice President Joe Biden, have been ongoing. The votes to raise the debt ceiling -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing. Our research showed that President Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush. "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills," Obama said. "Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people claimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in Congress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next five years," he said, adding,"Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that 'the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better." The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. We asked the Obama re-election campaign for comment on this but we didn't hear back. Obama was asked directly about his vote on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange: "You've got to extend the debt limit," Stephanopolous said. "And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?" "I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president," Obama replied. "When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it." Bachmann said Obama refused to approve an increase in the debt limit when he was a senator, and that he blamed President Bush for failed leadership, as well as Bush's supporters in Congress. She's right on both counts, and we rate her statement True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-06-14T17:37:18	2011-06-13	['George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-02195	Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America. Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/25/jimmy-carter/politifact-sex-trafficking-plagues-atlanta-carter-/	The topics of sex slavery and human trafficking have gotten plenty of ink lately. Only last month, a study commissioned by the Justice Department showed Atlanta topping a handful of cities -- including Miami and Washington -- in the lucrative sex-trade industry, with projected annual earnings approaching $300 million. Former President Jimmy Carter weighs in on the subject in his 28th and newest book, "A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence and Power." Carter is considered one of America’s most prolific writers among former presidents, only topped in most book counts by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. His book focuses on the abuse of women, which he calls "the worst and most pervasive and unaddressed human rights violations on earth." On radio recently to promote the book, the former president said, "Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America." "Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month," Carter told Scott Slade on News 95.5/AM 750 WSB on April 6. Numbers like those given by Carter are jolting to people who can’t relate to this dark and complex world where seller, buyer and, oftentimes, victim operate in secrecy. But how these numbers are gleaned merits further examination. Human trafficking, sometimes referred to as modern-day slavery, comes, according to the United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act, largely in two forms: commercial sex and work servitude. The victims of each comply most often through force, fraud or coercion. Sex involving a child under 18 also is classified as human trafficking. Steven Hochman, Carter’s assistant and the director of research at the Carter Center, said the numbers that Carter quoted in the interview with Slade -- 100 to 200 girls sold into slavery every month in Atlanta -- were "conservative." In his book (Page 127), Carter puts the number at between 200 and 300 girls a month. The former president obtained the estimates he used in his book from a presenter at the Carter Center’s Human Rights Defenders’ Forum, Hochman said. The presenter drew from studies released by The Schapiro Group in Atlanta from 2007 to 2011. Those studies estimated that 200 to 400 girls were being sexually exploited each month in Georgia. The Schapiro Group did research on the Internet, on the streets, in hotels and about escort services in an attempt to get a head count of underage girls being sexually exploited commercially. Similar estimates have been used by state agencies, including the Georgia Department of Education, which hosted a two-day conference last year for educators on how to spot and combat human trafficking. More studies are expected on the issue, including one by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The results of the GBI study should be out in May and will include numbers lower than those reported in The Schapiro Group study, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said. GBI officials have questioned the methodology of The Schapiro Group report, which company President Beth Schapiro stands by and says produced "very conservative numbers." "We are the first to say this is not perfect ... that our numbers are not complete," she said. "But it is a great starting point. And we are ready for more folks to jump in." Alan Seelinger, the state advocacy leader for the nonprofit International Justice Mission, said Carter’s numbers appear on target, based not only on The Schapiro Group study, but also on other tracking that’s taken place. As to Carter’s other statement that Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America, Hochman said the former president was drawing from media reports on the recently released study that was commissioned by the Justice Department and done by the Urban Institute. The four media reports Hochman referenced, including a blog post by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, could be misleading or confusing. They referenced Atlanta as "the capital," "the nation’s major hub" or the "No. 1" city for sex trade. But two of the reports, including the AJC blog, also noted the limited scope of the study. The Urban Institute report focused on eight cities -- Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Mo., Miami, San Diego, Seattle and Washington. Larger municipalities, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and New York were not included. The study showed that in 2007 the underground sex trade in Atlanta brought in $290 million, the largest amount for seven of the studied cities. (No estimate was made for Kansas City.) But No. 1 in America? One of the study’s authors says that statement wasn’t proven. "We don’t have the data to say which U.S. city brings in the most money nationwide," Meredith Dank told PolitiFact Georgia. Our conclusion: Sex trafficking is clearly a sizable and troubling problem in Georgia and elsewhere. As early as 2005, the FBI identified Atlanta as one of 14 cities where its offices reported having the highest incidence of children used in prostitution. But by its very nature, sex trafficking is hard to track, even estimate. That’s likely true whether you’re trying to size up the profits or gauging how many girls are involved. Carter’s estimate on the number of girls aligns with -- and is on the conservative side of -- other estimates that are out there. His statement about the lucrative nature of the business in Atlanta draws on recent research that found that in 2007 the sex trade generated $290 million in Atlanta -- the highest amount among seven of the eight cities that were studied. But his statement needed context so his audiences understand that it was drawn from a study that was limited in scope. His spokesman rightly points out that the media reports he relied upon, with only a cursory reading, support the label of No. 1 in the nation. You could look deeper into two of those accounts or read the report itself though, and see that it was an overreach. Both the media outlets and the former president could have done a better job. Part of Carter’s statement accurately quotes the estimates that are out there on the girls involved. The part about Atlanta being "the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America" is off base. Overall, we rate Carter’s two-part statement Half True.	None	Jimmy Carter	None	None	None	2014-04-25T00:00:00	2014-04-06	['Atlanta', 'United_States']

pomt-03857	"More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/12/nan-orrock/lawmaker-uses-polls-make-case-against-georgia-gun-/	Some gun-control advocates use as part of their arsenal in the national debate on this issue that most Americans support their effort, including background checks. Georgia state Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, made a specific claim about public support for such checks during a floor debate about Senate Bill 101, which she feared would expand access to guns. "More than 80 percent of Americans believe we need to have universal background checks," Orrock said. SB 101 would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as they were not dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless a ban is required by federal law or regulation. It passed the Senate by a 41-10 vote and is being reviewed by the state House of Representatives. PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some checking to see whether the senator is correct or is she exaggerating public support for such guidelines. After the December shootings of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., President Barack Obama put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of coming up with legislation to stem such violence. In January, Obama announced a series of proposals that includes background checks for all gun sales. Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check, which is commonly known as a "universal background check." Several Democrats, including Obama, have said about 40 percent of all guns are sold without a background check. PolitiFact has reviewed this claim several times and noted it’s based on a 1997 study, rating it Half True. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the state Senate Democrats, sent us several polls she says support Orrock’s point. Here’s a look at some of the polls Flowers sent us and some we found: The Pew Research Center conducted a poll Jan. 9-13 that found 85 percent of Americans support background checks for private and gun show sales. Respondents were specifically asked "would you favor or oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?" The poll talked to 1,502 people in all 50 states. About one-half of the respondents were interviewed on land lines; the other half on their cellphones. One-third of those polled said they had a gun in their home. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents said they were independents, 31 percent said they were Democrats and 27 percent said they were Republicans. CBS News and The New York Times conducted a poll of 1,110 Americans from Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 that found 92 percent of Americans support universal background checks. They were asked "Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?" The news organizations reported 85 percent of respondents living in a home with a National Rifle Association member support universal checks. About four of 10 polled said they were independents, one-third said they were Democrats and the rest said they were Republicans. A Fox News poll done Jan. 15-17 found 91 percent of respondents were in favor of criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales. Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they think of themselves as Democrats, 34 percent Republicans and 23 percent said they were independents. The pollsters interviewed 1,008 Americans. Slightly more than half of the respondents said someone owned a gun in their household. A CNN poll of 1,014 adults conducted between Jan. 14 and Jan. 16, 2011 found 94 percent favored background checks for gun buyers. Those polled were asked "do you favor or oppose background checks on potential gun buyers?" Mayors Against Illegal Guns forwarded us a poll it had conducted that concluded 91 percent of Georgians support mandatory background checks for all gun buyers. The poll was conducted Feb. 18-21. The respondents were asked "do you favor or oppose requiring all gun buyers to pass a criminal background check, no matter where they buy the gun and no matter whom they buy it from?" The largest portion of respondents, 38 percent, said they were Democrats. Thirty-five percent said they were Republicans, and 27 percent described themselves as independents. There was a margin of error of about 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points in each poll. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington recently fact-checked a claim by Obama that "overwhelming majorities of Americans" support gun legislation "like background checks." PolitiFact noted some of the same polls we reviewed. PolitiFact concluded more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Obama’s claim, though, was rated Mostly True because his statement suggested strong support for other proposals by his administration, not just universal background checks. To sum up, the senator said more than 80 percent of Americans support universal background checks on gun purchases. In each recent poll we reviewed, the public support for universal background checks was well above 80 percent. We rate Orrock’s claim True.

pomt-01709	Says that, as a Supreme Court justice, Greg Abbott found that a company whose vacuum cleaners were sold door to door "had no responsibility" in the hiring of a salesman who raped a customer.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/08/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-claim-about-hiring-salesman-rapist-lac/	In an ominous tone, the narrator of a TV commercial from Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis accuses Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican opponent, of siding with a vacuum cleaner manufacturer against a woman raped by a salesman in her home. In the 60-second ad, made public by Davis’ campaign on Aug. 7, 2014, the narrator says a door-to-door salesman offering a woman a vacuum cleaner demonstration in her Seguin home in March 1993 but then raped her as her children slept in the next room. "The salesman was a sexual predator on probation," the narrator says, "but the Kirby vacuum cleaner distributor had failed to perform a routine background check on him." "The woman and her husband went all the way to the Texas Supreme Court," the narrator says, "fighting for their right to sue Kirby. Six judges -- Democrats and Republicans -- ruled in their favor and they won," he says. "But Greg Abbott sided with the company against the victim. Saying the company had no responsibility." The words "Kirby owed no duty" appear on the screen, attributed to Abbott, a justice on the court from 1995 until 2001. A Davis campaign press release announcing the ad cited rulings issued in 1998, including the state Supreme Court’s 6-3 majority opinion and a dissent from Abbott. Campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas also emailed us a web link to a Jan. 1, 1999, Associated Press news story stating the court at that time said the Kirby Company should have required its vacuum cleaner distributor to do a background check before hiring salesman Mickey Carter, which would have revealed previous complaints of sexual misconduct. In the Dec. 31, 1998, majority opinion written by Justice Raul Gonzalez, the court agreed with the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals that a mandate by Kirby, the manufacturer, that its vacuum cleaners be sold only through home demonstrations gave the company a role to play in who got hired to do door-to-door sales even though a company agreement with its distributors said otherwise. "We hold that the company does owe such a duty," the court said. Specifically, the court said that "because Kirby required in-home demonstrations, the company exercised sufficient control over the sale of its products to end-users to justify imposing a duty of reasonable care in selecting the persons who performed the demonstrations." Kirby had argued its arrangements with vacuum cleaner distributors explicitly said the company shall exercise no control over the selection of individual salespeople. Kirby’s contracts specified: "The full cost and responsibility for recruiting, hiring, firing, terminating and compensating independent contractors and employees of distributor shall be borne by distributor." Abbott’s dissent to the court’s ruling, joined by Justice Priscilla Owen, said Kirby retained control over where the sales work was to be performed -- but not over who was to do that work. "Failure to require background checks of potential dealers relates to who is a dealer, not where the dealer works," Abbott wrote. "As a result, the requisite relation between the control retained and the alleged injury is missing. Because the Court holds to the contrary, I dissent." Abbott summed up: "In essence, the Court rewrites Kirby’s Distributor Agreement and Independent Dealer Agreement to require Kirby to assume control over dealer selection. Because the injury is not related to the control retained by Kirby," Abbott closed, "...Kirby owed no duty to" the woman "under the circumstances of this case." Our emails to the Abbott campaign did not yield responses, but Amelia Chasse of his campaign said in a statement sent to reporters including the Austin American-Statesman’s Jonathan Tilove that Abbott’s dissent still "left intact the liability against the sex offender and his employer." That is, the question in the Supreme Court case concerned only Kirby’s responsibility and did not affect the liability of anyone else in the case. A search of the Nexis database of news stories led us to a news story in the April 20, 2001, Dallas Morning News mentioning the dissent and generally quoting Abbott as saying: "What I was doing as a judge was applying the law." Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Abbott held that a company whose vacuum cleaners were sold door to door "had no responsibility" in the hiring of a salesman who raped a customer in her home. Then-Justice Abbott said the manufacturer had no duty, to be precise. But this claim fails to include the substantive detail that Abbott, unlike the court majority, considered most significant an existing agreement between the manufacturer and distributors explicitly giving full responsibility for such hirings to the distributors who, Abbott implied, had control over checking the background of applicants. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-05668	Because of the new health care law, "2.5 million young adults now have coverage."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-touts-coverage-25-million-young-/	The Road We’ve Traveled -- a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign -- touts his achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans. We’re checking several claims from the film, including one that "2.5 million young adults now have coverage." The law requires insurers to provide dependent coverage for children up to age 26 on all policies. The goal is to prevent young adults from becoming uninsured when their parental or college plans would otherwise run out. This provision took effect in September 2010. We found support for the film’s statistic in a Health and Human Services analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey, a longstanding survey conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey found an 8.3 percentage point increase in insurance coverage for the 19-to-25 age group between the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2011 -- from 64.4 percent to 72.7 percent. The analysis then multiplied 8.3 percent by 29.7 million -- the number of people nationally in that age group -- to come up with the number 2.5 million. We’ll note that the original CDC study, using slightly different methodology, found a smaller number. Using annual and semi-annual figures rather than quarterly numbers, the number grew by 1.3 million. The HHS analysis makes the case that, for various technical reasons, its method is superior. We think both estimates are reasonable, and while the 2.5 million figure got more traction in the media, we also think it’s worth noting that the underlying federal study offers an alternative -- and smaller -- number. In essence, the film cherry-picks the higher number. So the statement is accurate but needs clarification, which fits our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-05730	"[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/05/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-leaders-boast-employment-mostly-right/	At the beginning of each year, Atlanta-area residents can count on colder weather, higher heating bills and politicians bragging about the counties they lead. In Gwinnett, like most counties, Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash gave her State of the County address. Her speech was on Feb. 15. Like any other State of the County address, Nash spoke proudly of Gwinnett’s progress, including a list of achievements that sounded impressive. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether two of these claims, particularly with all the talk about jobs and unemployment, were correct. "[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties," Nash told an audience of county leaders and boosters. First, we wondered which counties was Nash referring to in her speech. Her communications director, Joe Sorenson, said they are the counties with the five largest populations: Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The Georgia Department of Labor keeps data that looks at employment and the unemployment rate in each one of the state’s 159 counties. In December 2011, the most recent month available before Nash’s speech, the unemployment rates were as follows in each county. Clayton: 11.8 Fulton: 9.8 DeKalb: 9.7 Cobb: 8.5 Gwinnett: 8.4 We’ll note that Clayton’s labor force, at 133,243, is one-third to one-quarter of the size of the other counties. The others have labor forces that range from 372, 274 in Cobb to the highest, 485,690, in Fulton. On that point, Nash was right. As for employment growth in Gwinnett, we had a problem with Nash’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia subtracted the number of people employed in Gwinnett in December 2010 from those in the workforce in December 2011. The increase was 2.2 percent by our count, not more than 3 percent as Nash said. Sorenson said Nash’s speechwriters made a mistake in the final draft of her address. They initially wrote that employment had risen by 2.3 percent, but they transposed the numbers and it read 3.2 percent. (Sorenson and his staff compared employment between June 2011 and June 2010 to come up with 2.3 percent. We used different months.) The communications staff ultimately changed it in the speech to "more than 3 percent." Nash’s staff was unaware of the error until contacted by PolitiFact Georgia. "It’s one of those silly things that I hope doesn’t reflect on a really good chair," Sorenson said. Nash’s first statement was accurate, but the second part was not because of the editing error. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Charlotte Nash	None	None	None	2012-03-05T06:00:00	2012-02-15	['None']

pomt-10095	McCain called for less regulation 21 times just this year.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/29/barack-obama/21-bottles-of-deregulation-on-the-wall/	Following the financial crisis, Sen. Barack Obama has blamed a scarcity of government regulation, and in turn criticized Sen. John McCain for advocating even less regulation over the past year. Here's a passage from Obama's speech in Raleigh, N.C., on Oct. 29, 2008: "When it comes to the economy – when it comes to the central issue of this election – the plain truth is that John McCain has stood with this president every step of the way. Voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed. Voting for the Bush budgets that spent us into debt. Calling for less regulation 21 times just this year. Those are the facts." We'll be the judge of that – at least with respect to the claim that McCain called for less regulation on 21 separate occasions this year. We asked the Obama campaign for evidence, and spokesman Tommy Vietor provided 21 citations of news reports over the past year. Some were clear cut calls for deregulation. For example, "We need less government. We need less regulation," McCain said in a quote that appeared on Washington Week , the PBS show, on Jan. 25, 2008. No doubt about that one. But what about this statement the Obama campaign cited from a July 3, 2008, statement McCain made after goverment figures showed a sixth straight month of job losses: "At a time when our small businesses need support from Washington, we cannot raise taxes, increase regulation, and isolate ourselves from foreign markets." One could quibble over whether a warning against increased regulation is the same as a call for less regulation. And this, from a McCain speech in Livonia, Mich., on Jan. 12, 2008: "Michigan's problems are rooted in failed government policies. Heavy regulation, too much government spending and taxes, and a high cost of doing business has hurt it dearly." That too is an implied, but not explicit, call for less regulation. In all, 14 of the examples the Obama campaign provided were explicit calls by McCain for less regulation. Six others were along the lines of the general condemnations of regulation cited above – what we would call implied calls for less regulation. (The Obama campaign cited two news accounts of the same McCain statement, so we discounted one of those.) Our fellow fact-checkers at CNN arrived at the same conclusion , and labeled Obama's claim "misleading." However, we found several instances of McCain calling for deregulation that the Obama campaign did not cite. For example, later in that Jan. 12 Michigan speech he said, "Michigan – and the United States – needs deregulation, freedom, innovation, and private control of money." On March 4, 2008, in Dallas, he said, "We will campaign to strengthen job growth in America by helping businesses become more competitive with lower taxes and less regulation." In Tampa on April 29, 2008, he called for "ridding the market of both needless and costly regulations." At a town hall event in Denver on July 7, 2008: "Beth (a local business leader) tells me it gets harder every year, not because of the market and competition, but because of government regulations, taxes and the cost of health care. Beth, I promise you, if I'm elected president, we're going to remove these obstacles to your continued success." We should note that since the financial crisis worsened this fall, McCain has softened his advocacy of deregulation of the financial markets. For example, on This Week on Sept. 28, 2008, George Stephanopoulos asked him, "In the past you said you were for less regulations, maybe even a moratorium. Do you think now we're heading into an era where we're going to have to have enhanced regulation?" "Two years ago, I said that I was worried about – co-sponsored legislation because of the excesses of Fannie and Freddie that I saw," McCain replied. "Six years ago, I railed about corporate excess and not expensing stock options. I'm a Teddy Roosevelt Republican. I believe there's a role of government. I believe that government has to be part of the solution. I mean, regulation and oversight has to be absolutely essential. Teddy Roosevelt said unbridled capitalism leads to corruption." Still, between the 14 explicit and six implied calls for deregulation the Obama campaign cited, plus the four explicit calls we found, Obama was on fairly solid ground with this claim. We find it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-29T00:00:00	2008-10-29	['None']
pomt-06954	"Sherrod Brown was just voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America" and is more liberal than Sen. Bernie Sanders.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/18/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sen-sherrod-brown-most-liberal-un/	When a Republican calls someone a liberal, it’s not meant as a compliment. Add the modifier "most liberal member of the U.S. Senate," and you’ve got red meat, especially in a middle-of-the-road state like Ohio. You’ve also got, as you may have guessed, the rap against Sherrod Brown. Josh Mandel, the Ohio treasurer who’s been raising money to run as the Republican nominee against Brown, laid out that accusation in an interview with syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt on June 24. "I don’t know if you know this, but Sherrod Brown was just voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America. Now that’s saying a lot when Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right of you." The National Republican Senatorial Committee made a similar characterization in news release July 6, saying Brown was "rated the most liberal member of the Senate." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Brown, a freshman Ohio Democrat facing reelection next year, supports the federal government playing an active rule in regulating industry, banking, health care and other marketplaces he believes are pocked with abuse. To check our assessment of whether he is, in fact, a liberal, we asked three Ohio political scientists -- Alexander Lamis of Case Western Reserve University, Daniel Coffey of the University of Akron and Eric Rademacher of the University of Cincinnati -- to characterize Brown as either a conservative, moderate or liberal. All three said liberal. Both a Mandel representative and the NRSC cited annual lawmaker ratings by National Journal, a nonpartisan, highly regarded magazine that covers public policy in Washington. National Journal’s ratings are popular with the political press. Cleveland.com, the website of The Plain Dealer, reported Brown’s most recent National Journal rankingwhen it came out in February. The ranking covered 2010. But as National Journal and others noted, Brown was actually in a nine-way tie for the title of most liberal. The other eight were Sanders, the Vermont independent who considers himself a socialist (in the tradition of social democracies like Sweden, Norway and Finland); Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid; and Democrats Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. Mathematically, this intrigued us. Consider the number of "most liberal," nine. Now count all the Senate Democrats in last year’s Congress: 57, plus Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. Nine out of 58 represents 15.51 percent -- meaning that, with rounding, 16 percent of the entire Senate Democratic caucus came in first place for the most liberal. This surely wouldn’t work in a beauty contest. Even as a criticism of lawmakers, it’s a bit of a Lake Wobegon standard, to use a public radio analogy -- a U.S. Senate where all liberals are above average. But how, exactly, do you define "most liberal?" National Journal did so by reviewing the actions of every senator on 96 roll-call votesand weighing each one on a liberal-to-conservative scale. A number of the measures concerned corporate subsidies or tax breaks that Democrats wanted to end; provisions of the new health care law that Republicans wanted to scrap, and financial reform measures that Democrats said would prevent future banking scandals but Republicans considered too sweeping. Yet not every vote used in the rankings was an obvious liberal or conservative measure. For instance, National Journal included a bill to continue business tax credits while also extending jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed. The same bill also made sure doctors didn’t get a Medicare fee cut. Business groups liked the tax provisions. Then-Sen. George Voinovich, a Republican, voted yes, saying jobless workers needed help. So did Brown. But a majority of Republicans voted no, saying the bill would weigh too heavy on the budget deficit. The partisan split made it a fair measure of the Senate’s Democrat-Republican divide, but Brown’s office questions whether this was really the mark of a liberal position. The same goes for several other votes, such as one confirming a northern Ohio judicial nominee, Benita Pearson. It wasn’t as if Pearson had baggage. Rather, this was one more vote in a tit-for-tat standoff between Republicans and Democrats over confirmations and hardball politics. Like Brown, Voinovich voted yes, but he was the only Republican to do so. Brown has been a senator since 2007, and since lawmakers are often judged on their entire records, we wanted to see how he ranked in the other years. According to National Journal, he was tied for "Most Liberal" again in 2009, this time with four others: Cardin, Whitehouse, Roland Burris of Illinois and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Sanders came in at 38th. This is where Mandel gets the claim that "Bernie Sanders, who’s a socialist, is to the right" of Brown. But going back earlier, Brown was the Senate’s 28th most liberal member in National Journal’s 2008 analysis, and 27th most liberal in 2007. National Journal isn’t the only player in the ratings game. Others include Americans for Democratic Action, which calls itself "a forthright liberal voice for the nation." The ADA gave Brown a rating of 95 percent for 2010. Five other senators got "perfect" scores of 100 percent. The American Civil Liberties Union gave Brown a score of 93, consistent with many other Senate Democrats. But four Democrats got perfect scores of 100. The League of Conservation Voters, tracking environmental issues, gave Brown a 100 percent score. But 23 other senators shared that perfect score. . And then there’s Voteview.com, a more comprehensive and mathematically driven evaluation compiled by political scientists across the country. Voteview examines votes on every contested bill in Congress, and since Congress works over a two-year term, Voteview ratings only come out every other years. Brown was the 11th most liberal Democrat in the two-year congressional cycle ending in 2010, based on Vote View’s assessment. Sanders came in at No. 6. Brown was the fifth most liberal in the previous Congress, representing his first two years in the Senate, while Sanders was No. 2 during that 2007-2008 period, according to Voteview. So we return to Mandel’s claim that Brown was "voted two years in a row the most liberal senator in the United States of America." and that he is more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Brown tied for first place in both of those years in the National Journal ratings. The tie in the most recent year included 16 percent of the Democratic caucus. To say that Brown was voted "the most liberal senator" misses the broad sweep of lawmakers in that category. As for the claim that Brown was to the left of Sanders, the Senate’s self-described socialist, it only survives if you include one year and one set of rankings, namely, again, National Journal’s. Neither Mandel nor the NRSC said they were basing their claim on exhaustive research or an array of possible ratings. And both were careful to say that Brown was "rated" or "judged" the most liberal, attributing the claim as opposed to making it themselves. Yet there is so much more information available, and so many more details -- the nine-way tie in 2010, the Sanders position in only one of the years (and not the most recent), the other ratings in which Brown was not first. A casual listener or reader would miss out on important context if he or she only heard their claim and didn’t see the fuller picture. A statement that is accurate but leaves out important details like these gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01653	David Perdue led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/22/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/jobs-did-go-overseas-how-many-unclear/	Jobs are always a big issue in elections. This week’s federal employment report gave Georgia the dubious honor of ranking 50th among the states and District of Columbia. With Georgia’s 7.8 percent jobless rate, only Mississippi fared worse. Lest anyone miss the blame, the Democratic Party of Georgia recently focused on jobs to draw a distinction between its nominee for the U.S. Senate, former Points of Light CEO Michelle Nunn, and her GOP rival. David Perdue "led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas" during his business career, spokesman Michael Smith said in a July 28 press release.. Smith cited Perdue’s leadership role at three firms – Sara Lee, Haggar Clothing Co. and Pillowtex – to arrive at the thousands figure. "It’s how he spent his career, looking to manufacture goods abroad instead of in the United States," Smith said. "That was his management style." Leveling that kind of charge requires a deep dive into Perdue’s career as an executive, starting when he was senior vice president for Sara Lee in 1992. Perdue told PolitiFact Georgia he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to open up the company’s Asia operations. His task, which he accomplished, was to increase manufacturing and contracts in the region. For the first three years of the decade, the company went on a spending spree, including acquiring undergarment maker Playtex in 1991, which focused heavily on foreign firms. By 1994, Perdue’s final year with Sara Lee, the company announced a major restructuring that eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide. Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down. The breakdown of jobs lost at overseas plants could not be determined, though a 1994 statement from Sara Lee said most of those jobs were at European operations. Perdue’s stint at Haggar is even clearer. As senior vice president from 1994 to 1998, Perdue was in charge of international operations and later also domestic operations at the clothing firm. Democrats point to the loss of about 1,950 domestic jobs at Haggar between the key years of 1996 and 1998, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. In that same period, domestic manufacturing dropped from 29 percent to 12 percent of operations. At least one domestic plant, in Texas, was shut down as part of discontinuing production of men’s suits. Those same SEC filings, though, show that workers in foreign countries also dropped – if only by 65 jobs – during that period. Sales, likewise, were down, from $437 million to $402 million, records show. "It looks like they shifted some production overseas, but not jobs, given the numbers," said Rob Bliss, a finance professor at Wake Forest University. "U.S. facilities were probably bloated and (cutting) them had a big effect on domestic employment." Perdue had a similar goal for Pillowtex, where he wanted to improve sales through aggressive marketing and branding and moving more work overseas. Shifting manufacturing abroad would put Pillowtex on the same page as other textile firms that had already moved offshore and would also save some jobs domestically, Perdue said. The plan was never put into place, though, after Perdue and other top managers found a $40 million-$50 million pension liability that had gone unnoticed as the firm emerged from bankruptcy. Instead of a turnaround, Pillowtex opted to sell off some pieces and eventually shut down entirely. Perdue left as CEO after seven months, with a $1.7 million paycheck, and 7,650 people lost their jobs, including 300 laid off from Pillowtex’s first bankruptcy. In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue acknowledges that some of his employers, and other firms, have developed a so-called "diversified matrix" that calls for shifting some operations overseas in a bid to save money – and American jobs. It is not a simple matter of trading a job for job, he said, a premise backed up by the complicated income statements and financial reports from the companies themselves. "We have total industries that have been decimated by the tax laws and regulations," Perdue said. "Some of that manufacturing can come back if we cut our corporate tax rate and stop penalizing foreign profits to encourage reinvesting in the United States." With that, we get into the question of political policy. The Democrats’ charge focused more on overall loss of jobs to overseas operations. It’s nearly impossible to prove, or disprove, the number of lost jobs at Perdue’s firms that went aboard. The only documented actual domestic job losses are from Haggar, but those jobs did not go overseas. Undoubtedly, records and news coverage show some job shift did occur. Even the candidate acknowledges as much. He also admits he would have sent jobs - potentially thousands of them - overseas at Pillowtex before a free fall pre-empted his plans and shut down that firm for good. The Democratic Party’s statement is partially accurate. Perdue did lead efforts that resulted in jobs being created overseas while jobs were cut in this country. How many jobs, it’s hard to say. And there is a lot of context needed to understand exactly why companies employed this strategy. Overall, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00087	Says "Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wild-number-sanctuary-city-criminal-/	As President Donald Trump races across the country to gin up Republican support in the midterms, he warns his audiences that Democrats are the party of crime. In Erie, Pa., Trump attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey for supporting a policy that Trump said put people in his own state at risk. "Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens," Trump said Oct. 10. "That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country." We decided to look at whether so-called "sanctuary cities" are as quick to release dangerous criminals as Trump said. They aren’t. A recurring theme While the details vary from place to place, the term sanctuary city is shorthand for any jurisdiction that won’t hold a person at the end of their jail or prison sentence solely because Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, wants to deport them. Trump reliably wields this against Democrats at his rallies. In Murphysboro, Ill., he said, "Democrat sanctuary cities release these criminal aliens out of jail and right onto your streets." In Mosinee, Wisc., he said, "They strongly support sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement and release known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our communities." We reached out to the White House for the details behind these claims and did not hear back. Specific to Casey and his voting record, based on the Pennsylvania Republican Party website, the charge goes back to Casey not supporting a 2016 bill that would have cut federal grants to sanctuary cities. On a largely party line vote, the measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle and died. Dicey data The most recent numbers from ICE paint a blurry picture of what’s going on. In response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about gangs, particularly the violent MS-13 gang with ties to El Salvador, ICE said there were 142 instances where jurisdictions nationwide released known or suspected gang members. The releases took place over about nine months between October 2016 and June 2017. The agency said 15 suspected MS-13 members were released, and 127 members of other gangs. The figure are less solid than they appear. ICE noted that it couldn’t say for sure that these were actual gang members, nor could it say that the releases were due to a lack of cooperation from local authorities. It told the senators that the numbers might not reflect "potential administrative errors," or "the jurisdiction’s actual level of cooperation and support." It also said that the count included times when jurisdictions told ICE that a person’s sentence was about to end "but ICE may not have been able to arrange a custody transfer prior to an alien’s release." ICE press releases report instances of ignored detention requests, but sometimes the people are let free by local authorities and then arrested by ICE within a day. This suggests some level of coordination that the data wouldn’t capture. In March 2017, three counties in Maryland disputed an ICE report that said they had ignored its requests to detain certain people. They said they never received those notices. ICE has arrested people with violent criminal records after local authorities released them. For example, in 2016, New York City arrested a Mexican national for drunk driving. Some time before he had served five years for a robbery with a deadly weapon and been deported. ICE sent a detention request Dec. 31, 2016, the day he was released. ICE arrested him a few weeks later. Trump spoke of thousands and thousands of dangerous immigrants released in Pennsylvania and the nation overall. But with ICE counting at most 142 cases nationwide for possible gang members, and the caveats that come with that figure, there’s no evidence for Trump’s sky-high number for a single state. Violent felons and others can be detained Lost in this debate are the details in the various sanctuary policies around the country. In particular, they treat dangerous criminals differently. "A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses," said Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine. "You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things." California law has a long list of crimes that give local officials the leeway to hold someone for ICE after they’ve served their time. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. Orange County, Calif., uses that flexibility to the utmost. It reported that in the first five months of 2018, it turned 316 inmates over to ICE. At the same time, it reported that it released 414 people and 45 of those were later arrested. Drug violations and resisting a police officer were the most common offenses, but two were for attempted murder. (It’s important to note that arrests are not the same as convictions.) The point is, as a rule, sanctuary laws allow for more dangerous offenders to be held for deportation. There is no detailed Democratic policy on this. Congressional Democrats broadly favor sanctuary city policies, and the party platform emphasizes the deportation of "those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities." Former President Barack Obama pushed for removals, and leaned on some cities, including Philadelphia, to do more to help ICE. Recent Democratic bills that touch on the issue ensure that state and local law enforcement can arrest and detain "previously-deported illegal aliens who have been convicted of a felony." Our ruling Trump said that Casey supported policies that had led to the release of "thousands and thousands" of dangerous criminal immigrants and "vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania." The White House provided no evidence to back that up. Casey opposed a bill that would have penalized cities that didn’t cooperate fully with ICE. ICE reported the release of 142 suspected gang members nationwide. The agency itself gave many reasons to question the figure, including the accuracy of the count of actual gang members and the connection to sanctuary city policies. No ICE data supports Trump’s thousands of releases in Pennsylvania or the country as a whole. Sanctuary cities' policies generally allow for detention of felons, which would include the sort of people Trump warns about. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02940	"78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/30/daniel-llanes/austins-78702-has-gentrified-its-not-no-2-gentrifi/	An Austinite skeptical of a possible city move further suggested that a chunk of East Austin has drawn so much interest, it’s nearly No. 1 nationally. In an October 2013 opinion article in the Austin American-Statesman, neighborhood activist Daniel Llanes, writing with Susana Almanza, objected to a proposed urban farm ordinance, which he said would enable landowners to convert single-family lots to commercial purposes. Speaking to pressures on East Austin, Llanes wrote: "In 2000, during the creation of our Neighborhood Plan, more than 600 properties were rezoned from industrial and commercial to residential. This transformed this neighborhood, and today it is a downtown neighborhood considered to be one of the most desirable in the nation. These neighborhoods, and the people of color in them, have made lemonade out of the lemon(s) despite a historic racism that has endured for almost 90 years. The result is that 78702 is the second-most gentrified ZIP code in the entire country." Defining gentrification We know 78702; it’s the inner-city region roughly bounded by Lady Bird Lake to the south, Interstate Highway 35 to the west, Airport Boulevard to the east and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to the north. And it’s the nation’s second-most what? Merriam-Webster defines gentrify as "to change (a place, such as an old neighborhood) by improving it and making it more appealing to people who have money." Gentrification, it says, is the "process of renewal and rebuilding accompanying the influx of middle-class or affluent people into deteriorating areas that often displaces poorer residents." No doubt, that’s happening in some of Austin’s core neighborhoods, driven in East Austin near the lake by what a May 18, 2011, American-Statesman news story described as a demographic transformation. "The number of African Americans residing in Central East Austin -- once considered the epicenter of black and brown life in Central Texas -- shrank by 27 percent during the past decade," the story said, "while the number of whites living there increased by 40 percent, and whites surpassed blacks as the second-largest racial or ethnic group. "African Americans or Hispanics still hold a majority or plurality in most East Austin census tracts," the story said. "But white residents had become the majority in two of the tracts by 2010." The story said the Hispanic population in Central East Austin also fell -- by 9.3 percent -- during the period, according to the newspaper’s analysis of 2010 census data for 20 tracts roughly bounded by Interstate 35, the lake, U.S. 290 East and U.S. 183. "The population shifts occurred as a development boom accelerated during the last half of the decade, attracting new residents into predominantly low-income, minority neighborhoods for myriad reasons, including the relatively low property prices there, proximity to downtown and something talked about a lot in Austin: quality of life," the story said. Finally, the story noted that discussions of gentrification often are cast against the legacy of the city's 1928 master plan, which segregated blacks to neighborhoods east of what is now I-35, "creating a painful hard-line history of inequities between east and west, whites and minorities." Charting increases in white residents Llanes told us that a chart produced by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a charity focused on education policy, was the basis of the 78702 claim. According to the chart, from 2000 to 2010, the 78702 ZIP code trailed only a Tennessee ZIP code for its increase in white residents. According to the chart, dated June 14, 2012, neighborhoods in 78702 saw a 33 percentage point increase in white residents — going from 23 percent of the ZIP code’s residents in 2000 to 56 percent in 2010. And that surge, the chart says, trailed only the 39 percentage point increase in white residents of Chattanooga’s 37408 ZIP code. In the decade, 78702 saw an overall population decrease of 5 percent, the chart says. And is the surge in white residents proof that 78702 was No. 2 in gentrification? Not according to the chart’s creator, Michael Petrilli, who said in a June 2012 blog post accompanying a revision of his original chart that his breakdown should not be taken as identifying ZIP codes with the greatest gentrification. In his initial chart, dated June 11, 2013, Petrilli said he "equated ‘gentrification’ with a significant increase in the white share of a neighborhood’s population. In my defense, I did admit that looking at the numbers by race was far from perfect—gentrification is a socio-economic issue—but census income data by (ZIP) code are not yet available for 2010. Still, I chose to use the ‘gentrification’ word, and it’s reasonable to point out its inaccuracy." More recently, Petrilli told us by telephone that surges in white residents are "obviously a very imperfect proxy" for gentrification. Separately, Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer, replied to our inquiry about 78702 by saying in an email that gentrification is "way more complex than simple rapid racial change. It really has far more to do with the displacement of lower-income households by higher-income households, regardless of race, resulting in a fundamental change in the character of the neighborhood." "But for sure, without question, 78702, or at least certain parts of 78702, are indeed gentrifying," Robinson wrote. He added that the "hard parts to measure are the velocity and spatial extent of gentrification." 78702 by changes in median income and other prosperity indicators Seeking better ways of gauging the gentrification of 78702, we solicited breakdowns of U.S. Census Bureau data from American-Statesman data editor Christian McDonald; Lloyd Potter, the demographer for the state of Texas; and Elizabeth Mueller, a University of Texas associate professor of architecture. Mueller checked changes in the number of residents living at two times the federal poverty level in the 25 urban ZIP codes that were identified by Petrilli as experiencing the biggest bumps in white residents. She emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that between the 2000 Census and the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest five years of its American Community Survey, taken from 2007 through 2011, the 78702 ZIP code had a 17 percentage point decrease in families living at or below two times the federal poverty level. That placed the ZIP code 12th among the 25 ZIP codes pulled from Petrilli’s list, Mueller said. Potter compiled median household incomes for the nation’s ZIP codes in 1999 and compared them with such incomes as gauged by the latest five years of the bureau’s community surveys. McDonald then helped us focus on how much such incomes changed in ZIP codes with 10,000 residents or more. The result: 78702, home to nearly 20,700 residents in 2011, saw a 12 percentage point improvement in median household income between the 2000 census and the latest five community surveys; it ranked about 300th in such growth among the 1,700 populous ZIP codes that similarly saw increases. Potter also compared the share of residents in ZIP codes in 1999 living at or below the federal poverty level with the share of residents who lived at or below poverty in 2011. According to a spreadsheet he emailed us analyzing the rates in counties home in 2000 to metropolitan areas of 1 million residents or more, 29.4 percent of the residents of the 78702 ZIP code lived in poverty in 1999; the level was 27.2 percent in 2011. The difference of 2.2 percentage points ranked the 78702 ZIP code about 2,000th nationally for its reduction. McDonald, drawing on census data, compared the median value of single-family homes. His spreadsheet indicated that, unadjusted for inflation, this factor in the 78702 ZIP code was up 192 percent, more than $100,000, between the 2000 census and five latest community surveys. This change in value, by percentage, placed the ZIP code 64th among ZIP codes home to 10,000 residents or more, according to the spreadsheet. Definitely gentrifying, but... Finally, we talked through our statistical breakouts with Mueller. She said by phone that while some of the indicators were not ideal for gauging gentrification--changes in residents living at or below the poverty level largely reflects people in public housing, she suggested--a reasonable upshot of our foray is the 78702 ZIP code is "not the second-most anything" nationally in terms of gentrification. "But is this area gentrifying? It is. In Austin, it’s definitely one of the areas experiencing the most dramatic change," Mueller said. "Gentrification is generally about several issues. It’s about displacement of low-income people, its about changing the character of a community, sometimes physically and socially, and it means loss of community voice. Right now, we’re losing low-income residents (in 78702). It’s up for grabs about (losses of) community character and community voice." Our ruling Llanes said 78702 is the nation’s second-most gentrified ZIP code. According to one breakdown, that East Austin area experienced the nation’s second-greatest urban increase in white residents from 2000 to 2010. However, changes in white residents alone are not an accurate way to measure gentrification, which is multi-factored. By other indicators, including changes in poverty, median household income and the value of single-family homes, 78702 has become more prosperous. Stacked up against other ZIP codes, though, it is not No. 2 nationally. Gentrified? Sure. Second most, nationally? Most evidence indicates otherwise. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-03806	The United States spends "$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" and pays for "the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/24/sean-duffy/uncle-sam-pays-free-cell-phones-pottery-classes-mo/	To hear U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., you’d think the former lumberjack and reality TV star might like to take a chainsaw to government spending and, um, bring it into the "real world." Indeed, the one-time county prosecutor came ready with what he considered to be evidence of waste when he appeared on the March 10, 2013, edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. Noting U.S. unemployment was edging down, Gousha asked: "Don’t you, your party, the president, don’t all of you in Washington feel under pressure to make sure that government doesn’t muck up what appears to be a rebounding economy?" Duffy acknowledged the improving jobs picture, then said: "We’re going in the right direction; that’s positive. But to think that you can’t cut -- we spend $2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes; we pay for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama. There are -- story after story about wasteful spending in government. Let’s cut that." (Duffy made the same multi-part claim two weeks earlier in emotional statements to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke during a congressional committee meeting. In that exchange, Duffy also said the government spent $700 billion to see how long shrimps can run on a treadmill. His staff later told a reporter he meant to say $700,000.) So, federal funds for free cells, pottery classes and a watermelon queen? Let’s check this out. For each of the three parts of Duffy’s claim, we’ll look at evidence provided by Duffy’s staff and information we collected ourselves. Duffy relied in part on "Wastebook 2012," which is produced by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. 1. Cell phones To back his claim that the federal government spent $2.2 billion on "free cell phones," Duffy cited a February 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal and a 2012 Federal Communications Commission report. The Journal revealed that the government spent $2.2 billion in 2012 on phone subsidies for the poor, but that more than 2 million people served by the Lifeline program hadn’t proved they were eligible. Lifeline, which is funded by fees paid by all cell and landline customers, is available to low-income people, including those on Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance. Wireless carriers often offer free phones to Lifeline customers, the FCC report says. PolitiFact National in 2012 and PolitiFact Texas in 2013 examined similar claims about free cell phones -- although those claims, unlike Duffy’s, tied the program directly to Obama. Lifeline started in 1985 to subsidize home phone service; cell service was added in 2008 under President George W. Bush. Subsidies for cell service now make up 75 percent of the program. Lifeline doesn’t actually give away phones, but rather pays an average of $9.25 (the subsidy varies by state) to a user’s phone company toward monthly home or cell service. However, many people end up with a free phone from a cellular carrier if they sign up for cell service with Lifeline. Assurance Wireless, for example, advertises a variety of Lifeline plans, as well as a free phone. Both the Coburn report and the FCC report also note that, to attract Lifeline customers, many carriers offer free phones. So, most but not all of the $2.2 billion in the Lifeline program subsidizes cellular bills. And, although the program itself doesn’t give away phones, it’s common for customers to end up with a free phone as a result of Lifeline. 2. Pottery classes Duffy cited a December 2011 federal audit to support his statement that the United States spends "$27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" (a claim that’s also been made by conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly). The audit evaluated a $27 million project of the U.S. Agency for International Development that was begun in 2009 "to provide technical assistance to improve Morocco’s economic enabling environment by improving the business climate, using water sustainably for agricultural growth and strengthening workforce development." So, the program is broader than what Duffy claimed, although the audit did single out pottery classes. Local residents reported that the classes from a U.S.-based trainer were ineffective, partly because the trainer spoke only English and the trainer’s translator wasn’t fluent in English. Coburn’s book also highlighted the pottery classes, but noted that only part of the $27 million went toward them. So, Duffy is wrong on this part of his claim. 3. Watermelon queen The third part of Duffy’s claim was that the federal government "pays for the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama." He cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture document on fruit and vegetable projects funded in all 50 states in fiscal 2012. Alabama got $401,366 for 13 projects, including one to "partner with the Alabama Watermelon Association to promote the consumption of Alabama’s watermelon through appearances of the Alabama Watermelon Queen at various events and locations." The Coburn book said $25,000 in federal money went toward the queen’s travel expenses. So, Duffy is correct on this part of his claim, although it should be made clear that Uncle Sam picks up only part of the queen’s tab. Our rating Duffy said the federal government spends "$2.2 billion on free cell phones, $27 million on Moroccan pottery classes" and pays for "the travel expenses for the watermelon queen in Alabama." Overall, Duffy’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-05125	Atlanta Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley "wants gas taxes raised."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/25/citizens-transportation-mobility/pro-transportation-group-says-tax-foe-pro-tax/	The folks leading the charge in support of a regionwide penny-per-dollar sales tax for transportation projects have raised a question to critics who don’t like the plan: So what’s your solution? A press release on that question brought on a verbal dispute we felt was worthy of a fact-check as both sides search for any weakness in the opponent’s position, showing what a tightly contested campaign this has become. Sales tax supporters thought they found the answer to their question when they read quotes attributed to Debbie Dooley, a prominent Georgia tea party activist who is among the most vocal opponents of the plan. "Tea Party leader wants gas taxes raised," read the headline to a press release written by Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an advocacy group in favor of the referendum. "Dooley publicly supports a never-ending tax with less public accountability." Dooley countered that the group wasn’t telling the whole story about her position on gas taxes. "We have repeatedly said until elected officials show us they are responsible with our tax dollars, they’re not getting a dime," Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia. In 2010, the Georgia Legislature voted to allow residents to vote by referendum on whether to increase their sales tax rates to pay for transportation projects. The Legislature divided the state into 12 regions to give residents choices of potential transportation projects that may best help their region, if they choose to do so. In a 10-county region that encompasses the city of Atlanta, its largest counties and other suburbs, the tax could fund 157 transportation projects if the referendum passes. The vote is scheduled for July 31. Some referendum opponents have a list as long as Buford Highway that outlines their objections to the plan. One reason they’ve said they don’t want it is they’re not in favor of an additional tax across an entire region. They don’t trust elected officials to spend the money as planned. Dooley outlined those concerns and others at a June 12 forum organized by the Civic League for Regional Atlanta. "We don’t feel like they’ve been fiscally responsible with the tax dollars they’ve been given," Dooley said of elected officials in her opening remarks. Dooley said she and others have presented some ideas to referendum supporters, but were rebuffed. She then talked about the gas tax. "We support increasing the gas tax, which has not been done since 1991," Dooley said at the forum, Citizens for Transportation Mobility wrote in the press release. Georgia’s excise gas tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon, the second lowest in the country. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) It has not changed since 1971, which Dooley actually said at the forum. Citizens for Transportation Mobility criticized Dooley’s idea. "We have been waiting on the opposition to come up with their ‘Plan B’ and we now see that they want to build more toll roads, raise gas taxes and take away the power of citizens to vote on a specific project list," said Che Watkins, campaign manager for Citizens for Transportation Mobility. "We are frankly shocked that a tea party leader would advocate for higher permanent taxes with less public accountability." Dooley actually said more than what was mentioned in the press release, a video of the meeting showed. "One of the funding mechanisms we would look at once the gas prices came down to a manageable level is to increase the gas tax," she said. Citizens for Transportation Mobility spokeswoman Saba Long defended the organization’s position, noting that Dooley didn’t say how much lower gas prices must be in order for her to support increasing the gas tax. "She’s trying to have it both ways," Long said. Dooley told PolitiFact Georgia gas prices must be $2 a gallon or less before she would consider supporting an increase to excise gas taxes. Dooley did float the idea of raising the gas tax. But she said in the same sentence that gas prices must come down first. She also stated her distrust of elected officials with tax dollars. Neither was included in the press release. The Citizens for Transportation Mobility statement was based on an accurate comment by Dooley, but it leaves out some important context. Under our rating system, that is a classic Half True.	None	Citizens for Transportation Mobility	None	None	None	2012-06-25T06:00:00	2012-06-13	['None']

pomt-14904	Says his plan would cut taxes without increasing the deficit.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/05/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-his-tax-plan-wouldnt-inc/	A week after the third GOP debate, Donald Trump is still salty at CNBC’s John Harwood, the moderator who asked him whether his 2016 bid was a "comic book version" of a presidential campaign. In asking the question, Harwood brought up the billionaire’s proposal to cut taxes without adding to the deficit — a goal, Harwood said, that’s nigh impossible. Trump agreed with the characterization but dodged the plausibility question. Here’s a part of the exchange: Harwood: "You talked about your tax plan. You say that it would not increase the deficit because you'd cut taxes $10 trillion, and the economy..." Trump: "Take off that ..." Harwood: "...would take off like — hold on. Hold on. The economy would take off like a rocket ship." Trump: "Right. Dynamic." Harwood: "I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms around." Trump: "Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who is a great guy, who came out the other day and said, ‘I love Trump's tax plan.’ " For the record, Larry Kudlow, a conservative economist and former CNBC anchor, said in September that he "really likes Trump’s plan." During the debate, Kudlow told Breitbart that he specifically loves Trump’s proposal for a 15 percent corporate tax rate but "can’t speak for the whole plan." But what about the whole plan? Will it be, as Trump wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, "revenue neutral"? We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign. But based on analyses conducted by two tax groups, Trump’s plan would lead to a revenue loss of $10 trillion to 12 trillion over 10 years. The plan Released on Sept. 28, Trump’s tax plan aims to, you guessed it, "make America great again" by providing tax breaks for middle-class Americans, simplifying the tax code, growing the American economy and not adding to our debt and deficit. It includes: • Four income tax brackets with rates of 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent, with no deductions except for the charitable and mortgage interest deductions; • A corporate tax rate of 15 percent, an end to the deferment of overseas corporate income, and repatriating of foreign income at a 10 percent rate; • A pass-through business income tax rate of 15 percent; • A capital gains tax at 0, 15 and 20 percent; and a tax on carried interest as ordinary income; • Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, the net investment income surtax, the estate tax and the Affordable Care Act taxes. The impact Both right- and left-leaning groups found that Trump’s plan could lead to at least a $10 trillion revenue loss in a decade, without factoring in interest. The liberal Citizens for Tax Justice pegged the cost of Trump’s plan at $12 trillion over 10 years and pointed out that 37 percent of the tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent. Trump’s plan, according to the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, would cut taxes by almost $12 trillion and also lead to an 11 percent higher GDP. With this projected growth, Trump’s plan would still reduce revenues by $10.14 trillion. To make the plan revenue neutral, Trump would have to make huge spending cuts. Experts said the scale of the cuts would not be realistic, given that Trump himself has said he intends to protect popular programs such as Medicare and Social Security. "It’s hard to imagine any way that this could be revenue neutral … unless you’re going to go after entitlements in a big way," said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which hasn’t released an analysis of Trump’s plan yet. "Contrary to Trump’s assertion that his plan would not increase the deficit, it would," Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation told us. He added that economic growth, investment, higher wages and jobs are far more important than adding or decreasing the deficit. Our ruling Trump said his tax plan would not increase the deficit. Free market-oriented and liberal groups alike say Trump’s tax plan would lead to a $10 trillion revenue loss, even if it did create economic growth. Since Trump has said he will not slash retirement programs like Social Security and Medicare, experts doubt that any spending cuts he made would result in a revenue-neutral tax plan. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-11-05T11:02:17	2015-10-28	['None']
pomt-09986	"Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/21/barack-obama/obama-says-venezuela-defense-budget-1600th-uss/	President Barack Obama was criticized by conservatives recently for a couple of handshakes and photo opportunities with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the Summit of the Americas. In a news conference after the summit, on April 19, 2009, Obama dismissed those critics, saying the Venezuelan military is not consequential enough to worry about. According to the Washington Post, Obama said, "Venezuela is a country whose defense budget is probably 1/600th of the United States. They own Citgo," the retail arm of Venezuela's national oil company. "It's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States." Chavez has significantly increased the Venezuelan defense budget in recent years, and so we wondered about the 1/600th figure. First, the numbers. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Venezuela had a defense budget of $3.3 billion in 2008, up from $2.6 billion in 2007. By comparison the United States is spending $711 billion on the military this year, including the cost of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. So Obama is slightly underestimating the Venezuelan defense budget. It is actually about 1/215th the size of the United States'. The size and firepower of U.S. defense forces also dwarf Venezuela's. But Chavez has made headlines in recent years for his efforts to ramp up and modernize the Venezuelan military, purchasing nearly $3 billion worth of assault rifles, fighter jets and helicopters from Russia. Venezuela also has made large defense purchases from Spain, Belarus and China, for everything from patrol boats and ammunition to radar systems for military air operations. Even with that, Venezuela is still "at best a second-rate regional power," said Larry Birns, director of the nonprofit Center on Hemispheric Affairs, which researches and reports on Latin American affairs. "Historically, the Venezuelan military has been a fairly rag-tag outfit, heavily politicized and exceedingly corrupt," Birns said. Even with Chavez's efforts to improve the military, "They just don't have the stuff that could pose a serious threat to the United States." According to a May 2007 analysis prepared by COHA research fellow Alex Sanchez, "Even if Venezuela is upgrading its military more than other countries in its category, it is most likely doing so for defensive purposes. It would be ludicrous to believe that the country would launch any kind of military aggression against the U.S., shooting at Stealth bombers with rifles." So, yes, Obama's numbers were a little off. We're not going to ding him too hard for that, though, as his overall point is correct. And Obama's use of the word probably 1/600th suggests it is more of a guestimate than a hard statistic. The Venezuelan military is indeed a tiny fraction of the size of the U.S. military. And so we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06921	"There’s pretty much no question that [the curfew ordinances] aren’t effective in either reducing crime or preventing harm to young people."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/22/mike-males/limited-studies-say-teen-curfews-ineffective/	In a May 31 news release, just as Atlanta’s teens were embracing the warm glow of summer vacation, city officials announced plans to enforce a long-standing juvenile curfew. The rationale was safety. "I want everyone in the City of Atlanta, especially our young people, to enjoy the summer months," Mayor Kasim Reed said in the statement. "At the same time, it is vital that we keep everyone safe." But Mike Males, a researcher with the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story two weeks later that the mayor’s logic is flawed. "There’s pretty much no question that [the ordinances] aren’t effective in either reducing crime or preventing harm to young people," he said. That’s a strong position to take against a very popular crime-reduction tactic. Curfews have been around forever, imposed by moms and mayors alike. In 1884, President Benjamin Harrison called them "the most important municipal regulation for the protection of children in American homes from the vices of the street." Curfews fell out of favor in the mid-20th century and did not regain popularity until the Clinton administration. By the mid-1990s, the U.S. Conference of Mayors found 70 percent of nearly 350 cities surveyed had some sort of nighttime curfew. The overwhelming majority of cities considered the curfew effective and a good use of police time. Atlanta’s current curfew has been on the books since 1977, although enforcement has waxed and waned. The curfew says young people 16 and under cannot be on the streets unsupervised past 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. It includes some exceptions for work, school events and emergencies, making it similar to curfews in other cities. Violation of the curfew nets a warning on the first offense and a $1,000 fine and possible jail time on subsequent violations, but it’s the parent or guardian who gets the punishment. So we know that curfews are popular, but is Males right when he says they don’t work? For the answer, we turn to ... Males. It turns out, he is one of the leading researchers in the effectiveness of teen curfews and his work is cited frequently in scholarly papers and the media. In a widely referenced 1998 paper on the impact of curfews in California, Males and co-author Dan Macallair found curfews "had no discernible effect on youth crime" based on a statistical analysis of cities enforcing the laws. In some cases, curfew cities actually saw crime go up compared with cities that did not enforce a curfew, they found. Males and Macallair said crime statistics in curfew cities "suggest that solutions are more complex and multifaceted." In an interview this week, Males said curfews presuppose that all young people are equally likely to commit a crime. Since they aren’t, curfews become an inefficient tool for combating youth crime, perhaps wasting police resources, he said. Males’ research is backed up by a popular survey of studies on curfews published in 2003 by criminal justice researcher Kenneth Adams, who also found scant evidence that the laws accomplished what most people believed they did. "Studies consistently report no change in crime in relation to curfews," Adams wrote, although he indicated curfews likely would remain popular. "The seduction of common-sense reasoning sometimes is too strong to be swayed by scientific evidence," he wrote. While the researchers agree that curfews do not lower juvenile crime, they also admit their conclusions rest on relatively few studies. As a result, Adams allows that curfews "may encourage parental responsibility," and he wrote there is some evidence a short-term curfew focused on certain high-crime areas does reduce crime. But a more recent stab at measuring the effectiveness of curfews comes from University of California at Berkley economist Patrick Kline. Using an economic theory called the substitution effect, Kline says there is evidence that curfews curb youth crime. In consumer economics, the substitution effect holds that higher prices result in lower consumer demand. With curfews, Kline said the criminal penalties for curfew-breakers results in a decline in youth crime of up to 10 percent. Kline’s paper has been picked up across the country by curfew advocates looking for a champion, but Males said the study has significant shortcomings. For example, Kline does not compare cities that have curfews with similar cities without curfews to see whether crime is declining generally. In fact, juvenile arrests peaked in the mid-1990s and has been declining nationally ever since, along with arrests for lots of adult crimes. Males said Kline’s assessment does not take those larger shifts into consideration. Males also said there are some problems with applying a theory governing how milk prices get set with criminal justice. "The problem with economic substitution theory is that not all juveniles are equally likely to commit crimes," he said. Kline’s paper has gone through several revisions, and according to his website, is awaiting publication in American Law and Economics Review. So the weight of academic opinion sides with Males’ assessment that curfews do not reduce crime. But Kline’s interpretation suggests the question deserves more research. Males saves himself with the qualifier "pretty much," but at least some still are asking questions, leaving us with a ruling of Mostly True.

pomt-02747	The Employment Non-Discrimination Act "discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/16/traditional-values-coalition/religious-activist-group-says-enda-would-discrimin/	Early in the 2014 campaign season, religion has played an important role in the Arkansas Senate race. Incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, released an ad recently about how the Bible guides him. Interestingly, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacked Pryor on the issue, challenger Rep. Tom Cotton’s office went against fellow Republicans to stand with Pryor. But that’s not where the debate about Pryor’s faith ends. It circles back to his November vote in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prevent workplace discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. It passed in the Senate but hasn’t been taken up by the House. While the bill’s status is in flux, the debate among lawmakers, advocacy groups and religious leaders continues. The Traditional Values Coalition, a religious activist group, criticized Pryor for his ENDA vote. Andrea Lafferty, the coalition’s president, highlighted a perceived contradiction of Pryor’s religious beliefs in a Dec. 6 mass fundraising email. "There's a reason why Pryor is attempting to run as a Christian in Arkansas," she said. "It's because Pryor has voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in Washington, a bill that discriminates against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom." PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at how religious organizations would fare if the bill becomes law. American Christianity and LGBT rights Before we take a look at the bill, let’s contextualize the coalition’s claim in the broader context of American Christianity. It’s important to note that within Christianity, gay rights is a divisive and complex issue. The Traditional Values Coalition’s ENDA disapproval is shared by other Christian groups, like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. They expressed their view in an Oct. 31 press release: "The USCCB continues to promote the dignity of both work and marriage and to oppose unjust discrimination on any grounds, including those related to homosexual inclination or sexual identity. But we cannot support a bill, like ENDA, that does not justly advance the dignity of all workers and authentic non-discrimination." At the same time, groups like ReconcilingWorks, a Lutheran group that welcomes gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) members, support ENDA’s passage. "ReconcilingWorks: Lutherans for Full Participation believes that all hardworking people — including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people — should have a fair chance to earn a living and provide for their families without fear of being fired for reasons that have nothing to do with their job performance," spokesman Tim Fisher said. "We strongly support the passage of ENDA." As the gay rights movement gains more traction, some Christians have changed their perspectives. "Most American Christians do not want a gay pastor overseeing their church, and that is not likely to change soon," said Kate Bowler, an American Christianity professor at Duke University. "However, we are seeing thawing numbers of those who agreed that gay people should be allowed same-sex unions." The basics The ENDA bill would prohibit private-sector employers and government employers on the local, state and federal levels from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That protects people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Under the law, employers can’t fire or refuse to hire people based on actual or perceived sexuality and gender identity (which need not align with a person’s biological identity). Churches and other institutions with religious purposes (like schools and daycares) are exempt from the ENDA rules, just as they are from the religious discrimination portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s Title VII. Under Title VII, and therefore under ENDA, religious organizations, which need not be church-run, would be exempt. Additionally, all businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempt, whether they’re religious or not. Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who specializes in religious liberty, said ENDA’s religious exemption exceeds Title VII’s. "It’s broader because the religious exemption in Title VII only allows religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of religion," he said. But it doesn’t allow religious groups to discriminate based on factors like an employee’s gender or race. So by permitting religious organizations to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ENDA allows them more flexibility than Title VII. Let’s break down the Traditional Values Coalition claim to see how each mention would be treated if ENDA becomes law: Daycare: "If it were a secular daycare that just happened to be owned by a religious individual with a conviction that prohibited them from hiring LGBT folk, then the exemption would not apply," Tebbe said. He added that nonprofit daycares with religious affiliations would be exempt. Parents: "There is nothing in ENDA that would require parents to alter their beliefs or what they teach their children about religion, homosexuality, marriage equality, et cetera," said Ian Thompson, an American Civil Liberties Union representative for LGBT issues. Business owners: For-profit companies with 15 employees or more would need to abide by ENDA, said Dena Sher, an ACLU religious liberty counsel. But Christian nonprofits and Christian (or any other) businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be exempt. Tebbe also noted that religious organizations who don’t hire LGBT people are protected under ENDA. Rights of religious freedom: "Not only does the Constitution protect religious freedom broadly, but existing federal discrimination law already prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion," Thompson said. The Traditional Values Coalition doesn’t believe that these religious exemptions are broad enough. "ENDA would not cover any secular companies and organizations that are run by committed Christians," said Harry Mihet, a Liberty Counsel lawyer the coalition referred us to. Mihet is correct. But as far as discrimination goes, in the bill’s full text, there’s no reference to Christianity, or to any other individual religion, for that matter. All religions are treated the same and can legally invoke the same exemption. And Christianity isn’t the only religion that has historically grappled with acceptance of sexuality and gender identity issues. Merriam-Webster defines discrimination as "the practice of unfairly treating a person or group of people differently from other people or groups of people." To say that the law discriminates against Christians doesn’t fit based on our experts’ interpretation of the bill and the inclusion of an overall religious exemption that applies to any religion, not just Christians. "If you had some exemption that wasn’t available to Christians, that would be discrimination," said Doug Laycock, a law and religious studies professor at the University of Virginia. "The only way they’re treated differently is they get an exemption." Our ruling The Traditional Values Coalition said ENDA discriminates "against Christian daycare, Christian parents, Christian business owners, and the rights of religious freedom." The bill’s religious exemption indicates that churches, church-run initiatives and other religious businesses need not comply by employing people of all sexualities and gender identities. And there’s no special negative treatment for Christians. Businesses of any religion could qualify for the exemption. Individuals of any faith who oppose sexuality would have to abide by the law, so no religion is singled out. We can understand why religious conservatives may take issue with this bill. However, the rhetoric in the email is too broad and overstated, and claims to speak for all Christians. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02606	"We have the lowest beer tax in the nation."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/24/rod-monroe/does-oregon-have-lowest-beer-tax-nation/	After the decision by Washington voters last year to privatize the sale of liquor, Oregon legislators are now wrestling with whether to follow suit. While no decision is likely during February’s monthlong legislative session, issues surrounding alcoholic beverages are very much on the table in Salem these days. At a recent work session on the topic, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, noted that prices climbed dramatically in Washington after voters there allowed large retailers such as Costco to sell distilled spirits. He said Oregon should be cautious in making big changes and observed that if more money is the goal, expanding the number of state-owned liquor stores would provide one solution. Then he added: "If our concern is revenue, we ought to look at the fact that we have the lowest beer tax in the nation." While this may be welcome news, coming right before next weekend’s Super Bowl, we wondered if that’s true. Does Oregon have the lowest beer tax in the country? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We called Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group in Washington, D.C. Its website includes a weekly map of the United States showing beer tax rates in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Drenkard, noting that the statistics are drawn from another group, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said Oregon ranks 45th nationally with consumers paying a tax rate of 8 cents a gallon of beer. That comes out to just under 4 cents tacked on to the price of a six-pack. The rate puts Oregon behind only Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Wyoming, which has a 2 cent-a-gallon beer tax. Tennessee, by contrast, ranks first at $1.17 per gallon. Alaska’s $1.07 is second. Monroe, contacted via email for a response, wrote: "If you add in the sales tax, Oregon has the lowest. The states that are lower than Oregon have a sales tax. When you add the sales tax to the beer tax the total is higher than Oregon." According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a Washington, D.C., tax-research group, Monroe is correct when it comes to sales taxes. Oregon is one of nine states that does not have a sales tax. However, general sales taxes apply to most retail items, not just beer. We called Drenkard back to get his thoughts. "Sales taxes do affect the price of beer, but it’s not a beer-specific tax," he said, noting that 20 states do impose additional taxes pertaining specifically to malted beverages. "Then again, corporate taxes also affect the price of goods, including beer. Should we add those in as well? Where do you draw a line?" Oregon, according to a national group that tracks beer taxes, has one of the lowest such rates in the county. The 8-cents-a-gallon rate -- sixth-lowest nationally -- has remained unchanged since 1978. But Monroe claimed that Oregon has the lowest beer tax in the U.S. Later, he tried to justify that assertion by saying it’s the lowest if Oregon’s lack of a sales tax is taken into account. He didn’t make that specification in his original statement, though, and sales taxes aren’t specific to beer. We rate his claim False.

pomt-03759	Says "I've authored the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter-century."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/06/ron-wyden/did-wyden-write-first-bipartisan-tax-reform-bill-2/	U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,held a press event in Portland last week to promote a tax reform bill he’s co-authored with a Republican from Indiana. Wyden said that taxpayers now have to go through "bureaucratic water torture" to do their taxes. The rules are such a complicated mish-mash that many people need professional help to file their returns. "It simply doesn't have to be this way. I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. I've authored the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter-century. This is with Sen. Dan Coats, the Republican from Indiana," Wyden said. The first bipartisan tax reform bill in 25 years? PolitiFact Oregon thought the statement a pretty bold claim to make. Don’t people elected to Congress like to write up laws? We started digging. The context: The last time the federal government overhauled the tax code was in 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was in office and the parties split control of Congress, much like today. Wyden, who was elected to Congress in 1980 and to the Senate in 1996, has talked often about the need to revisit the bipartisan spirit of that time. Wyden wants to simplify and streamline the tax code. He says he also wants to lower the burden on families and small businesses. Wyden first proposed an overhaul in 2010, pairing with Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. After Gregg left office, Wyden partnered with Coats in 2011 and plans to introduce the legislation again this year. The analysis: We asked Tom Towslee, a Wyden spokesman, to back up the senator’s assertion. Towslee said the office had checked with the Congressional Research Service, the body’s nonpartisan research arm, and was told of a 1995 plan sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga, and Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That plan would have replaced the income tax with a consumption tax, which Towslee said is not the same as a comprehensive reform plan. "I think you’ll agree that reforming the current income tax code to make it fairer, simpler and more efficient is very different from replacing it outright with something else," he said. We turned to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. President Scott Hodge checked with his staff and they also came upon the Domenici-Nunn "USA Tax Act" of 1995. (Tax bills in 1990, 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2003 may have had some crossover appeal, but these were bills to raise and lower tax rates, and not to address the tax code in a comprehensive way.) "It may be a stretch, but not a big one," Hodge said of Wyden’s claim. "What Wyden cares about is re-creating the bipartisanship that brought about the 1986 bill. He may not be the first, but he is in small company." We checked a database of Congressional bills. We found numerous bills, often introduced over multiple sessions, for a flat tax or for a fair share tax, sponsored by Democrats or Republicans, but not both. We also found several efforts to do away with the Internal Revenue Service, some with a Democrat or two on board with Republicans. For example, H.R. 352, introduced in January, is a four-page document that terminates the IRS Code of 1986 in Section 2 and calls for a new federal tax system in Section 3. It is skimpy on details. We also caught up with Jane Gravelle, the senior specialist at Congressional Research Service who assisted Wyden’s office. She’s been there 40 years, done tons of research in the area and could not locate legislation similar to the 1986 effort other than Wyden’s. She does not consider the Nunn-Domenici effort a general income tax reform bill on par with Wyden’s bill. "I would also add that formulating and actually putting a major tax reform bill into legislative language is a major undertaking, not something that can be done easily and quickly," she said in an email. Indeed, Wyden’s bill runs 120 pages. Apparently we were mistaken in thinking that lawmakers like to draft lengthy, complicated legislation on the tax code. The bills are rare. The ruling: Some politicians call the tinkering of tax rates "tax reform." We don’t buy that. Some people consider the Nunn-Domenici bill of 1995 a bipartisan tax reform bill. We can see why Wyden’s office, with back-up from the research service, would differentiate his plan from their plan. Still, the 1995 effort merits a mention as additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04788	Says Obama puts "15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare ... that will lead to denied care for current seniors."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/23/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-15-unelected-unaccountable-bureaucr/	Remember the discredited Republican attack that President Barack Obama’s health care law created a "rationing board" or "death panel"? It’s back — but with a softer edge. And it’s coming from the architect of the lightning-rod Republican plan to turn Medicare into a program that pays for private insurance. Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan claims an "unelected, unaccountable" board created by the health care law "will lead to denied care for current seniors." His language is more measured than other claims we’ve weighed over the years about Medicare’s new Independent Payment Advisory Board. But did he reach the truth? Ryan trotted out the campaign line (and his Medicare-eligible mother, Betty) on Aug. 18, 2012, in retiree-heavy Florida community The Villages, and repeated it two days later in New Hampshire. "Here's what the president won't tell you about his Medicare plan, about Obamacare," he said. "The president raids $716 billion from the Medicare program to pay for the Obamacare program. What's more, in addition to that, he puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare, who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." We’ve evaluated versions of the $716 billion claim, finding that the amount wasn’t "raided" or "robbed" but that the law reduces future spending through a series of cost-saving measures. (Meanwhile, Ryan’s own House budget took advantage of the same savings he attacks.) Here we’re checking Ryan’s comments about the Independent Payment Advisory Board. ‘Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats’ The Independent Payment Advisory Board, slated to start work in 2013, was created by the health care law to put distance between politics and Medicare. (An evenhanded report from the Kaiser Family Foundation describes the board and its origin.) Its 15 full-time members aren’t elected. But that doesn’t mean they’re unaccountable. • They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. • They can’t serve more than two six-year terms. • Their recommendations can be rejected by Congress. • They must follow disclosure and ethics guidelines, and they can’t perform other jobs as they serve. • They can be removed by the president for "neglect of duty" or "malfeasance in office," though not for any other reason. Henry Aaron, an economist who specializes in health care and tax policy at the Brookings Institution, says they’re accountable in the same sense that members of any federal regulatory commission are accountable — they serve fixed terms and can be removed for cause. But Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, argues that all members of independent commissions, once appointed and confirmed "are almost impossible to move or influence." By contrast, she says, other types of presidential appointees, such as Cabinet members, can be pressured to resign if they make serious mistakes. In addition to limiting the reasons a board member might be removed, lawmakers sought to insulate the board’s decisions from special-interest lobbying. • Its recommendations are fast-tracked in Congress and go into effect automatically if lawmakers fail to act. • Implementation of its recommendations isn’t subject to administrative or judicial review. So, board members aren’t elected, but while their decisions are protected by law, they are to some degree accountable. In particular, they could fail to win a second term, or get fired by the president. Are they bureaucrats? They become members of the bureaucracy by definition once they join the board. But they won’t all start that way. The law specifies that members will represent a mix of different professions, from health finance and economics to health facility management to medicine. In other words, the same kind of people who might advise health care spending decisions outside of government. ‘Required to cut Medicare’ If Medicare grows too quickly, the Independent Payment Advisory Board is required to recommend cuts. But it won’t have as large an impact as you might imagine. Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, reduces Medicare’s growth by more than $700 billion over the next 10 years, as we noted above. How much savings will the board generate? Less than 4 percent of net Medicare savings in the law’s first decade, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Recommendations from the board probably wouldn’t be necessary after that, according to Medicare’s actuary. That’s because it only has to recommend cuts in years that Medicare misses its growth targets. After 2019, other savings in the health care law, if allowed to take effect, would keep the program in check. So it’s fair to say the bulk of the savings in the law are outside the board’s purview. It’s only if those other measures fail to keep Medicare spending on track that the board is required to recommend additional ways to save. Meanwhile, if Congress comes up with another way to achieve the savings, it could overrule the board’s proposals. ‘Denied care’ Ryan said the board would "cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." But by law, the board can’t ration care. It can’t change benefits. It can’t change eligibility. It can’t increase what seniors pay. So it’s expected to cut payments to providers. That could be a problem, since some providers say they’re underpaid already. New York Times and USA Today stories in 2009 and 2010, for example, feature doctors opting out of Medicare because of its low payment rates. How might that affect care? Imagine, say critics, being unable to find a nearby hospital or doctor who takes Medicare. Or discovering that payments for a particular service or procedure have been reduced. "In that way, at least in theory, you could get actual denial of care," said Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, who opposes the health care law. The Medicare actuary, Richard Foster, estimated that savings from the entire health care law would make about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies unprofitable by 2019. That means, presumably, that to stay open they would need to shift costs to non-Medicare patients, merge with other providers or withdraw from Medicare, he said. That’s one reason he’s testified that growth reduction under the law isn’t sustainable in the long range. It’s "a serious issue," said Wilensky, the Bush-era Medicare official. But that’s the projected effect for the entire law. Meanwhile, the board itself is required to consider "to the extent feasible" how its recommendations would affect access to care, especially in rural and other underserved areas. Our ruling Ryan said that Obama "puts a board of 15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in charge of Medicare who are required to cut Medicare in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors." Board members aren’t elected, but it’s a stretch to say they’re entirely unaccountable. They’re appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. The president can fire them for neglect of duty or malfeasance.They’re required to recommend cuts to Medicare in years that other cost-saving measures don’t meet growth targets — but Congress can overrule their recommendations. Meanwhile, "denied care" is a strong way to phrase the board’s possible effect. It’s expected to recommend cutting provider payments, with an eye on cutting waste and inefficiency. That could restrict some seniors’ access to care, depending on the what actions the board actually takes. Meanwhile, the board oversees only a small percentage of the Medicare savings in the health care law. Ryan creates the specter of an unaccountable board making all of Medicare’s spending decisions, but that’s scarcely the case. There’s an element of truth to his claim, but his overstatements add up to a Mostly False impression.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-08-23T14:40:20	2012-08-18	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10167	McCain "said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he . . . wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/29/barack-obama/yes-wary-about-spain-and-maybe-confused-too/	During the first presidential debate, Barack Obama said John McCain has been too reluctant to support high-level diplomacy with other nations. Obama said that was true not just with U.S. enemies such as Iran, but also with a longtime ally like Spain. Obama said that McCain "even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he — you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us," Obama said. "I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally." Obama was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, to the White House. McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration — and now McCain — to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies. Here's the relevant portion of the interview: Q: Senator, finally, let’s talk about Spain. If you’re elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you? A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. I’m glad we’re now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House. Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself? A: Uh, I don’t, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both. Q: So, you have to wait and see if he’s willing to, to meet with you, or you be… able to do it? In the White House? A: Well, again… I, I don’t… All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and that’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region. Q: OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if you’re elected president? A: I’m willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not. McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it "a global champion of freedom." The U.S. State Department says "Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields." But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq. We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him "OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the president of Spain." But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with "any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are." We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional. "The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero — and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview," Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to the Washington Post and CNN. Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain "will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance." So where does that leave us? Obama is right that McCain "said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain." McCain's words make that clear and are reinforced by Scheunemann's statement. It's less clear if McCain "wasn't sure whether (Spain is) aligned with us." To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that "I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities" indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations. So we find Obama's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-29T00:00:00	2008-09-26	['Spain']

pomt-09164	"My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.' "	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jun/08/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-democrat-bill-white-sent-president-/	On May 19 in Houston, Rick Perry revisited his objection to proposals to cap carbon emissions nationally, saying such a change would devastate the energy sector and the Texas economy, according to an online write-up by The Houston Chronicle. Referring to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, Perry said: "My opponent in November of 2008 sent a missive to the White House, to President Obama-elect, and said, 'Here's how you need to sell cap-and-trade to the American people.'" To date, there’s no evidence of White supporting the "cap-and-trade" scheme. So his advising the Democratic president-elect on how to sell the idea amounts to rich campaign fodder for Perry. Does Perry recap White's message to Obama accurately? Some background: Cap-and-trade plans typically try to ratchet down air pollution by making a set number of pollution allowances available to industry. Companies can trade or sell the allowances if their facilities pollute less than they’re allowed. The House passed a bill last year to start such a system, but the legislation has not advanced through the Senate. To our request for elaboration, Perry’s campaign pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2008 e-mail sent by White, then mayor of Houston, to Rahm Emanuel, who was slotted to become Obama’s chief of staff. The eight-paragraph e-mail, later noted by Perry's campaign in blog posts and an online video advertisement, surfaced on a Chronicle blog on May 18, 2010. White's campaign confirmed the e-mail's authenticity. Several times, White’s message to Emanuel, under the subject line "Energy Policy at the Beginning of an Administration," refers to the cap-and-trade possibility. Each mention advises against an early push. White’s e-mail says Obama should focus on "several high-impact objectives during his first year to make steady progress to meet energy policy goals while also stimulating the economy. But he should not try to do something ‘comprehensive’ on domestic carbon emissions until these tools are in place." Later, the e-mail says: "Avoid during 2009 wading into the mire of cap-and-trade or user taxes on carbon before the new Administration and Congress has made progress" on White’s energy-related recommendations. White’s e-mail says: "A carbon-based tax or sales (scheme) could be characterized as intrusive government increasing costs or simply another scheme to extract money from the public unless there is a clear ‘path forward’ on (a) transportation fuel efficiency; (b) efficiency of electrical power use; and (c) affordable clean power alternatives." The message continues: "The public can understand why we need to lower energy costs, reduce emissions, and cut imports. We can accomplish that goal while reducing carbon emissions. But do not allow the concept of reducing carbon emissions to drive this process. Lowering energy bills with clean domestic energy is a much better approach." White’s recommended to-do’s? His e-mail says Obama should accelerate the use of vehicles that use 40 miles per gallon or more. More advice: fund a program to retrofit 1 million homes and apartments occupied by low-income residents. And, he writes, Obama should encourage new power plants to use cleaner-than-coal natural gas, among steps. White’s campaign spokeswoman, Katy Bacon, said White referred to the cap-and-trade prospect because the idea was debated during the 2008 election year. In his campaign, Obama committed to creating a cap-and-trade system — a promise that PolitiFact has lately rated "in the works." Next, we contacted an Austin advertising firm to get another take on whether White's e-mail reads like advice on how to sell cap and trade, as Perry puts it. Patrick Cline, a partner at JH&A Advertising, credited White's message with couching in step with an understanding that a cap-and-trade plan could wreak havoc with the state's petrochemical plants. But, Cline said, White's note stops short of being a primer on selling cap and trade to the American people. Our conclusion: White's e-mail is not close to the "how-to" guide Perry claims. Indeed, White's message urges the incoming administration not to push a carbon emissions proposal until after it has advanced other energy-related ideas. Nowhere does the e-mail offer guidance on pitching cap and trade. Perry floats a politically potent but inaccurate, ridiculous characterization. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06765	Outside of recall elections, "there's never been a public official removed from office" in Wisconsin "for anything but malfeasance in office."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/21/bob-ryan/sheboygan-mayor-bob-ryan-says-no-public-official-w/	Defiant Sheboygan Mayor Bob Ryan-- whose drinking problems have spurred scorn from citizens, humiliation on YouTube and ridicule from Jay Leno -- says he would become a singular figure in the history of Wisconsin government if his Common Council succeeds in removing him from office. Wisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office. But Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall. On Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean. Ryan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay. "This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall," he said. "If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever." For us, the key claim is this sentence: "There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office." Never is a long time. Ryan didn’t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it. "Public official," for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters. Ryan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor. The saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife’s sister. Ryan’s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him. The drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign. To see whether Ryan’s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts. They include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Here’s what we found: Fatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature’s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Given that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan’s claim. Felony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan’s would be. Crimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district’s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan’s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected. Non-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial. That case does undercut Ryan’s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office. As rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008. The Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority. In Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011. Let’s review what we’ve found. The embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office "for anything but malfeasance in office." Ryan’s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council. Our sense is it’s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position. This is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we’re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin. For now, we feel Ryan’s statement needs a little clarification, but is essentially accurate -- our definition of Mostly True.	None	Bob Ryan	None	None	None	2011-08-21T09:00:00	2011-08-15	['Wisconsin']

pomt-11144	"It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child."	true	/texas/statements/2018/may/30/dan-patrick/texas-law-bars-adults-leaving-loaded-guns-accessib/	Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a national TV audience after the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shootings that he doesn’t see a need for more gun regulation in that Texas already bars children from having loaded weapons. We decided to check Patrick's reference to law given that the admitted Santa Fe shooter reportedly used his father’s shotgun and handgun in the attack. Our research identified the 1995 law, though we also learned it wouldn’t apply to the Santa Fe incident due to the shooter’s age of 17. Patrick, taking questions from George Stephanopoulos on the May 20, 2017, edition of ABC's This Week, said: "We have to look at ourselves, George. It’s not about the guns. It’s about us. Can there be gun regulation? "Gun control, I believe, starts at home, George. Every person who owns a gun must be accountable for their guns at home," Patrick said. "We don’t know all the facts yet. But this particular young man got his guns in some way from his parents’ home. You should have your guns locked up. It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child, for example." Law confirmed Our online search for such a law led us to a web page about preventing Texas children from getting guns created by the San Francisco-based Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That page says Texas has a law holding a person criminally liable if he or she, "with criminal negligence," fails to secure a "readily dischargeable" firearm and a child under age 17 gains access to it. Next, we turned to section 46.13 of the Texas penal code, titled "Making a Firearm Accessible to a Child," which defines a readily dischargeable firearm as one "loaded with ammunition, whether or not a round is in the chamber." The law states: "A person commits an offense if a child gains access to a readily dischargeable firearm and the person with criminal negligence: (1) failed to secure the firearm; or (2) left the firearm in a place to which the person knew or should have known the child would gain access." Under the law, "secure" means "to take steps that a reasonable person would take to prevent the access to a readily dischargeable firearm by a child, including but not limited to placing a firearm in a locked container or temporarily rendering the firearm inoperable by a trigger lock or other means." The law otherwise provides defenses to prosecution starting with whether the child’s access was supervised by a person older than 18 and the firearm was for hunting, sporting "or other lawful purposes." Under the law, a violation is a Class C misdemeanor or a Class A misdemeanor "if the child discharges the firearm and causes death or serious bodily injury to himself or another person." Legislative history Legislative records show the legislation creating the law won approval in 1995, the same year that then-state Sen. Jerry Patterson, R-Pasadena, shepherded into law the state's concealed-carry measure. We connected with Patterson, who told us by email that the child-specific proposal, initiated by Rep. Al Edwards, D-Houston, had momentum that year in part due to testimony by a Houston couple who had lost their son to an accidental shooting. The boy’s mother, Linda Tarr, testified at the time: "This bill is to save children. It is not a gun-control bill. This is a gun-responsibility act, and children are our responsibility.'' Effective law? We also wondered about the law’s effects. The April 1995 Austin American-Statesman news story where we spotted Tarr’s testimony said that in 1993, 42 children younger than 17 had been killed in accidents involving firearms. There have lately been fewer such deaths, according to figures we requested from the Texas Department of State Health Services. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen emailed us a chart indicating that in 2014-15, 11 Texas children younger than 17 were killed in accidents involving firearms. Separately, Ari Freilich, a lawyer for the Giffords center, said by email that Texas is among 27 states with child access prevention laws potentially making adults legally accountable for letting minors gain unsupervised access to guns. But Freilich called the Texas law weaker than laws in some states because it only applies to adults who leave readily operable loaded firearms accessible to unsupervised minors. "As a result, Texas' law would likely not apply even if an adult left an unsupervised minor home alone with an unloaded firearm out on the table right next to a box of ammunition," Freilich wrote. Also, Freilich said, the Texas law wouldn't apply to what evidently happened at Santa Fe High School because the admitted shooter was 17--and the law applies only to guns taken by minors 16 or younger. After the Santa Fe shootings, the center posted a memo to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott stating the law should be amended, at the least, to apply to minors under 18 "and to cases where an adult leaves unloaded firearms and ammunition accessible to the minor." We also asked the NRA-tied Texas State Rifle Association about the law. By phone, Alice Gene Tripp praised it, saying: "It doesn’t try to criminalize how you store your guns. It simply puts a penalty in statute if you don’t do it effectively. Texas allows adults to make adult decisions and penalizes those who don’t do it correctly." Our ruling Patrick said: "It’s against the law in Texas to let any loaded gun get in the hands of a child." A 1995 state law makes it a misdemeanor if a person with criminal negligence fails to secure a loaded gun and a child younger than 17 accesses it or if a person leaves the gun where he or she knew or should have known the child would get it.

pomt-11059	"Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/25/gateway-pundit/immigrant-girl-time-cover-wasnt-separated-mother/	A Time magazine cover photo of a young immigrant girl sobbing as she looked up at President Donald Trump became a symbol of the criticism over Trump’s immigration policies, but the iconic image was misleading. Several headlines on Facebook challenged the image, including this headline by The Gateway Pundit which largely drew from an article by The Daily Mail. "Shock: Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated; mom deported in 2013, left husband with good job, 3 other kids, paid coyote $6k to sneak back in U.S." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo of the Honduran girl in McAllen Texas was taken by John Moore, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer for Getty Images. Moore joined a Border Patrol agent, Carlos Ruiz, for a ride along on the border June 12. Moore took a photo of the girl crying next to her mother when they were detained by federal agents near the U.S.-Mexico border, and the cutline distributed by Getty said that the mother and her daughter were detained "before being sent to a processing center for possible separation." Time then created a photo illustration using the image of the crying girl and a photo of Trump with the headline "Welcome to America." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Cover image of Time used with permission) The photo came to symbolize Trump’s since-reversed policy that led to separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. But it also came to symbolize how viral images on social media can be used to create misleading impressions. The girl’s father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, told reporters that the girl and her mother have been detained together and were not separated. Honduran deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera’s version of events to Reuters. In an interview with CBS News, Ruiz said agents asked the mother, Sandra Sanchez, to put down her daughter, nearly 2-year-old Yanela, so they could search the mother. "I personally went up to the mother and asked her, 'Are you doing okay? Is the kid okay?' and she said, 'Yes. She's tired and thirsty. It's 11 o'clock at night," Ruiz told CBS News. Ruiz said the image was misleading. "They’re using it to symbolize a policy, and that was not the case in this picture," Ruiz said. "It took less than two minutes. As soon as the search was finished, she immediately picked the girl up, and the girl immediately stopped crying." Time interviewed Moore about taking the photographs at the border. Time posted a correction to that story June 19: "The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together." However, Time stood by the cover story. "The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment," Time's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement to CNN published June 22. Moore told the Washington Post that Time corrected the story after he made a request minutes after it was published. He said that the picture "is a straightforward and honest image" showing a "distressed little girl" whose mother was being searched by border officials. Moore said on Instagram that the girl and mother were taken into custody together and held at a detention center in Dilley, Texas. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a statement to the media that said Sanchez, 32, was arrested by border patrol on June 12 near Hidalgo, Texas. On June 17, 2018, Sanchez was transferred to ICE custody, and is currently housed at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. Her immigration proceedings are ongoing. Our ruling A headline by The Gateway Pundit said "Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated." A Getty photographer took a photo of a girl crying when her mother was detained by the Border Patrol. The girl’s father, as well as a Border Patrol agent, confirmed that the girl and her mother were not separated. The agent said they were separated for a few minutes while the mother was searched. Time published a correction in a story in which the photographer was interviewed stating that the girl was not carried away by agents and the two were taken away together. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04195	November 2012 was "a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/dec/07/ken-detzner/florida-elections-chief-says-we-had-record-turnout/	A few days after the election, a CNN reporter asked Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner about long lines and other problems Florida had on Election Day: "How could this happen in 2012 in a state in the United States, that people would wait six hours and many would just abandon and not vote at all?" Detzner responded that there were two reasons for the long lines. First, Florida had a long ballot -- 11 constitutional amendments and in Miami-Dade, a slew of local amendments -- on top of the presidential election and local races. Second, he said, turnout "was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history." Detzner identified some other issues throughout the interview, including that elections offices need to have sufficient equipment and the state needs more early voting locations. Was the Nov. 6, 2012, election in Florida a "record" for overall turnout? And did Florida also break a record of pre-election day voting? In mid-December, Detzner plans to make a fact-finding trip to five counties that had some long lines and other election problems, including Miami-Dade, where voters stood in line for as long as seven hours. Broward is also on that list -- the county found 963 ballots after Election Day, but the supervisor said that they weren’t actually "lost." Detzner will begin his road trip in Tampa, which performed well, as a benchmark before he visits the counties that had problems. Overall turnout Florida’s general election turnout was about 71.2 percent. This was no record. Statistics starting in 1954 show Florida general election turnout exceeded 71.2 percent 11 times: 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008. The highest general election turnout was 83 percent in 1992 when Bill Clinton won his first presidential race. "Relatively speaking, Florida in 2012 moved backward when it came to voting," the Miami Herald wrote after the election. Detzner was referring to the sheer number of voters -- 8,491,920 -- not the percentage of voters who participated, said Chris Cate, Florida Department of State spokesman. That’s the highest number of voters who have ever participated. Cate said that "more total people cast a ballot, early or not, in this election than any previous Florida election." Looking at 1992 -- the year that had record-high turn-out -- Cate noted that about 5.3 million Floridians cast a ballot, which is about three million fewer than November 2012. This growth in the number of voters makes sense considering Florida's population growth. We looked up the numbers and found the state population was 13.7 million in 1992 but grew to 19 million in 2011 (the most recent data available). Early voting and absentee Florida began offering absentee ballots to everyone -- not just those who could prove they were out of town or in the military -- in 2002. The state began offering early voting in 2004. Let’s look at the breakdown for the types of votes cast in presidential general elections since the start of early voting: 2004 2008 2012 Absentee 1,352,447 1,850,502 2,358,638 Early 1,428,362 2,661,672 2,411,811 Absentee+Early 2,780,809 4,512,174 4,770,449 Total (Absentee+Early+Election Day) 7,640,319 8,456,329 8,491,920 Source: Florida Division of Elections (Note: Total reflects certified results.) In 2012, about 4.77 million Floridians cast ballots early or absentee, more than either 2008 or 2004. There was also a huge increase -- more than 1 million -- in early voting between 2004 and Barack Obama’s first presidential victory in 2008. Despite those large increases in early voting, a Republican-led state Legislature voted in 2011 to cut back the number of days for early voting. Republican Gov. Rick Scott refused to extend early voting in 2012. In response to the state’s decision to reduce early voting days, the Obama campaign encouraged supporters to vote with absentee ballots, which are typically mailed in but can also be dropped off in person at the supervisor of elections office. Detzner’s focus on sheer numbers rather than percentage We sent Detzner’s claim to several political science professors who study elections and asked whether it is more relevant to compare turnout percentages or raw numbers, particularly when examining why we had election problems and how to fix them. "In the end, it is the total number of people that show up that creates the lines and counting delays, not the percentage," University of Central Florida professor Aubrey Jewett wrote in an email to PolitiFact Florida. Given that state and local officials knew that record numbers of people had registered, they should have been prepared for record numbers of voters, Jewett said. "I shudder to think what things might have looked like if we actually had a record turnout percent this past election!" Our experts also said turnout numbers shouldn’t be used as an excuse for the long lines. The state Legislature was responsible for reducing early voting days, limiting early voting locations and for placing 11 amendments on the ballot. And decisions by local officials about spending, training, equipment and staffing also contributed to problems. "Overall, there is plenty of blame to go around for our voting problems at both the state and local level," Jewett said. Steven Tauber, a government professor at the University of South Florida, told PolitiFact Florida that he saw three main reasons for the long lines: "The primary reason is that the state was unprepared for the volume of voters, and they should have been. Clearly, the state did not provide enough resources to handle the election. The second point is that for no good reason, the state cut back on early voting. The third reason is that the state legislature unnecessarily loaded the ballot with needless, wordy amendments (most of which lost) that lengthened the amount of time it took people to vote." Susan MacManus, a University of Southern Florida professor, said that the more relevant information is what happened on a local level, in the counties that had the long lines or problems. "I don’t ever like to use aggregate statewide figures when you have concentrated areas of problems," she said. But turnout figures don’t provide much of a window on the problems in South Florida. In the state’s largest county in Miami-Dade, turnout dropped from about 70 percent in 2008 to about 67.6 percent in 2012. The number of voters increased slightly by about 16,000. In addition to the long ballot, the county faced a series of other problems that contributed to the lines, including a shortage of temporary workers and equipment, and the county’s decision to delay a plan to redraw precincts to avoid huge crowds where the population had swelled. Broward had an even bigger dip in turnout percentage but a similar increase in voters -- and again, that doesn’t explain problems, such as finding 963 ballots in the elections warehouse after Election Day. Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes told the Sun-Sentinel that her office "got thrown off its game" with a lawsuit that allowed in-person absentee voting the Sunday and Monday before Election Day, days that were meant to prepare precincts and tabulate absentee ballots." Our ruling As he was grilled about Florida’s long lines, Detzner said, "The turnout was unprecedented. It was a record year of turnout. More people voted before Election Day using absentee ballots and voting early than ever before in our history." He’s right that the sheer number of voters was a record, at 8.5 million. Also, he's right that more people "than ever before" voted early or absentee. But it was not the highest turnout by percentage. At 71 percent, 2012 marked the 12th highest turnout since 1954. We rate Detzner’s claim Mostly True.	None	Ken Detzner	None	None	None	2012-12-07T13:55:46	2012-11-09	['None']
pomt-02135	"A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-people-dont-health-care-law-i/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton isn’t saying yet whether she’s running for president in 2016 -- "I am somebody who has to really mull things over because there is a cost to everything," she said on May 6, 2014. Even so, Clinton remains very much in the public eye, including a May 6 keynote address to the National Council for Behavioral Health. In her remarks, Clinton voiced support for the Affordable Care Act and offered a nuanced take on the polling numbers. "There have been many complaints and concerns about the Affordable Care Act, but I’ve been struck by the polling I’ve been reading, because it tells the same story," she said. "A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act. A small majority wants to repeal it, but that is slowly receding as a rising majority says, ‘No, fix it.’ This is the tradition of good, old-fashioned American pragmatism." We recently fact-checked Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on the public’s support for repeal, which appears to have remained stable in recent months. And recent Kaiser Family Foundation polling shows that from March to April, the percentage of people who said they want improvements to the law jumped from 49 to 58. But what about Clinton’s claim that most Americans want to keep Affordable Care Act protections, even if they don’t like the law itself? Clinton didn’t return our request for comment, but we found her analysis to be on target. According to RealClearPolitics, a political news and commentary site that aggregates polls, an average of five polls found that 52.3 percent of voters expressed opposition to the health care law. That’s a small majority, just as Clinton said. Other surveys record smaller percentages, in the 35 percent to 45 percent range. What about her argument that Americans like specific protections in the law, even as they oppose the law as a whole? The Kaiser Family Foundation’s March 2014 report breaks down how voters feel about different components of the Affordable Care Act. A majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored 7 of the 11 elements Kaiser asked about in March. They are: Tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance: 88 percent support Close the Medicare "doughnut hole": 81 percent support Create health insurance exchanges: 80 percent support Extend dependent coverage: 76 percent support Subsidy assistance to individuals: 76 percent support Guaranteed issue of insurance policies: 66 percent support Penalties for insurers who spend too little on medical care: 65 percent support On an additional three elements of the law, a majority of Americans expressed support, but only a minority of Republicans: Medicaid expansion: 71 percent An increase in the Medicare payroll tax for upper income earners: 60 percent The employer mandate: 57 percent So on 10 of the 11 elements, substantial majorities of Americans expressed support, justifying Clinton’s claim that "a large majority of Americans" support individual elements of the law. But there was one exception: The individual mandate, one of the cornerstones of the law. It attracted the support of only 40 percent of Americans -- 55 percent of Democrats, 39 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans. Our ruling Clinton said, "A small majority of Americans don’t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don’t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act." An average of recent polls shows that just over 50 percent of Americans favor repealing the law. And a recent Kaiser study shows that "large majorities" of Americans favor 10 of the 11 elements of the law the pollsters asked about. However, Americans do oppose one crucial element of the law -- the individual mandate. That's something Clinton's comment glosses over, so we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-14009	Says Donald Trump "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-cited-miss-unive/	During a forceful, even mocking address on foreign policy, Hillary Clinton lit into some of Donald Trump’s past comments -- including one in which he recalled the time he held the Miss Universe pageant in Russia in 2013. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia," Clinton said during her address on June 2, 2016. Is that correct? We found that the attack is pretty close to the mark, though somewhat overstated. Clinton’s barb stemmed from an interview Trump did with Fox News’ Bret Baier on May 6, 2016. At one point in the interview -- around the 16:40 mark here -- Baier asked Trump about whether he had ever met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, which is an issue Trump had been coy about in previous interviews. Trump told Baier that once again he would have no comment on the question, in order to protect Putin’s confidences. Trump went on to say, however, "I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success." (Trump sold the pageant in 2015.) We won’t gauge whether experience putting on a beauty pageant can give someone important foreign-policy insights -- something Clinton was clearly skeptical of during her speech. But it is true that Trump mounted the event in Russia in 2013. (As Politico’s Michael Crowley reported, Trump "watched 86 contestants don shimmering evening gowns and skimpy swimsuits for what he would call ‘the world’s biggest and most iconic beauty contest.’ ") So Clinton certainly has a point that Trump referenced his leadership of the Miss Universe pageant as a credential, and we didn’t notice any subsequent efforts by Trump to backtrack on what he said. However, Clinton overstated the case modestly when she accused Trump of claiming the pageant as "foreign policy experience." Trump definitely cited his pageant experience as evidence that he could work with Russia and Putin -- but the discussion with Baier never broadened out to foreign policy generally. Later in the exchange, for instance, he said that "they (Russia) want to be friendly with the United States ... (but) they really dislike Obama." So Trump didn’t say that the pageant helped him understand foreign policy overall. But he did say that it would help him get along with Russia. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump "says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia." Trump did cite that as evidence of how he could navigate a relationship with Russia and work with its president, Putin, but he didn’t go so far as to say it bolstered his foreign policy experience more generally.

pomt-06124	Says Newt Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/27/restore-our-future/pro-romney-super-pac-says-new-gingrich-supports-am/	A pro-Mitt Romney "super PAC" is flexing its muscles in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, telling conservative voters not to fall for President Barack Obama’s plan to diminish Romney. The group, called Restore our Future, is running television ads in Iowa and Florida. "Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich," the ad says. "Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com." Super PACs aren’t formally affiliated with campaigns, but they can still spend money to try to influence elections, and they don’t face the same disclosure requirements as official campaigns. In this case, Restore our Future is run by supporters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. The ad makes a lot of claims. Here, we wanted to check whether Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants." We looked into Gingrich’s position on amnesty when we fact-checked comments Romney made on Nov. 23, 2011. Romney said Gingrich’s immigration plan offered "a new doorway to amnesty." We rated that Mostly True. And in fact, the Restore Our Future ad cites that fact-check as evidence to support its claim. But the wording in this ad is slightly different. To examine it, we’ll review Gingrich’s positions on illegal immigration and amnesty, then we’ll see how that record compares with the ad’s statement. Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an "amnesty" program, both then and now. Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay. "Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here," Gingrich said at a debate on Nov. 22, 2011. "If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out. "The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone." Gingrich sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove "deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties"; and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000. In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally. "My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen," Romney said the day after the debate. Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney. "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this for our earlier check. After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: "If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit." On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses that favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements. She praised Gingrich for his honesty. "He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people," she said. "At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’" When Romney has been asked about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation. "You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally," Romney said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 29, 2011. Our ruling "Amnesty" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have "family, church and community ties." They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Gingrich’s plan is clearly an amnesty of sorts, though it is more limited in scope. The ad says Gingrich "supports amnesty for illegal immigrants." That’s a blunter claim than the statement we rated previously from Romney, that Gingrich’s plan is "a new doorway to amnesty." Romney’s comment implied that there was something new about Gingrich’s plan rather than being the same amnesty policies of the past. The ad, on the other hand, loses that nuance. So we rate its claim Half True.	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2011-12-27T14:18:53	2011-12-20	['None']
pomt-00092	George Soros was an SS officer.	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/31/blog-posting/viral-photo-ss-officer-not-george-soros/	Was George Soros, anathema to the political right, an SS officer? A photo of a young man in glasses and a uniform, eyes looking away from the camera, has been attributed to the businessman who invests in Democratic causes. "This is George Soros," reads the text stamped above the photo in a post to Facebook on Oct. 18. "Remember this the next time the Soros-funded liberals call you a racist, fascist, or Nazi." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo isn’t a fake, but it’s not George Soros. It’s an old photo of Oskar Gröning, one of 300 Auschwitz staff members. Gröning, who died in March, was a corporal in Hitler’s Waffen SS and he became known as the bookkeeper of Auschwitz, according to the New York Times’s obituary of one of the last Germans to face war-crime charges connected to the Holocaust. He was accused of being an accomplice in the murder of about 300,000 Hungarian Jews, and though he maintained that he only played an office role managing money confiscated from Jews at the death camp, he admitted to witnessing atrocities, including the gassing of Jews who had tried to escape. He was sentenced to four years in jail at age 94. Soros, meanwhile, fled fascism. When the Nazis invaded Hungary, his father obtained false identities for Soros and his brother, according to a 2018 profile of the billionaire in the New York Times. He sent Soros to live with an agricultural official who passed him off as his Christian godson. "The official’s job included taking inventory of a confiscated Jewish-owned property," according to the story. "He took George with him.

pomt-01499	Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit and more.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/24/facebook-posts/nba-nfl-congress-spousal-abuse-fraud-bad-checks-ba/	Whose pants are the most on fire: the NBA, the NFL, Congress or Facebook memes? Several readers sent us Facebook messages this week asking about a meme popping up on their newsfeed. It’s a list of statistics about crime, corruption and generally bad behavior, and it asks the viewer to guess if the list describes players in the NBA or the NFL. Surprise! It says it’s actually describing Congress. The meme struck us as suspect right off the bat. It says, of Congress’ 535 members: 36 have been accused of spousal abuse 7 have been arrested for fraud 19 have been accused of writing bad checks 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses 3 have done time for assault 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges 8 have been arrested for shoplifting 21 are currently defendants in lawsuits 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year Wowza. One version on Facebook was posted Sept. 18 and already has more than 328,000 shares, The meme has appeared on Reddit a few times this week, too. Our friends at Snopes and FactCheck.org debunked the claims in this image years ago. But with the NFL’s current scandal concerning spousal and child abuse, it makes sense that this meme is circulating again. So we’re going to debunk it again. We don’t dispute that some lawmakers are involved in nefarious activities. Take, for example, former Rep. Trey Radel, R-Fla., who resigned earlier this year after he was caught buying cocaine from a federal agent. There’s no comprehensive database about all congressional crime and generally unsavory behavior, so we can’t come up with the real numbers on our own. But we know enough about where the meme originated to say that these statistics can’t be trusted. We searched the news, Congressional Quarterly membership profiles and other sources and couldn’t find anywhere near 84 arrests for drunk driving, 14 arrests for drug-related charges, 36 accusations of spousal abuse or any of these other accusations. We’re not even sure how you’d measure things like indirectly bankrupting a business or a person’s bad credit. The meme gives no author or source information. However, Snopes examined a near-identical 2012 version that references a 1999 series of articles by Capitol Hill Blue, an online politics publication. (Capitol Hill Blue has had several issues with credibility in the past.) Keep in mind that if these statistics were true -- and we’re reasonably certain they’re not -- they’re 15 years old. Only 100 members of the current Congress were in office in 1999, when Capitol Hill Blue published the stories. The Capitol Hill Blue articles say the authors’ research revealed each one of the statistics listed above, though sometimes with slightly different wording. (With one exception: the article says 29 members have been accused of spousal abuse, rather than 36.) The authors mention "public records, past newspaper articles, civil court cases and criminal records," but do not quote specific documents. They also say plainly of some of their sources, "We have talked with former associates and business partners who have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends." So these sources possibly had an agenda in talking to Capitol Hill Blue. We can’t even check which members of Congress Capitol Hill Blue is talking about. The article says, "We will not run lists of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out or been charged with slapping a spouse." All of this makes it difficult to take these allegations seriously. Even further, the series has been removed from Capitol Hill Blue’s website. It’s only accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which periodically saves web pages. As far as we can tell, it was removed mid 2013. (In the last version that was saved, editors had removed the statistics from the article completely.) We reached out to Capitol Hill Blue for comment but haven’t heard back. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Congress includes 36 people accused of spousal abuse, 84 arrested for drunk driving in the past year, 71 with terrible credit and more. These accusations appear to be fabricated. The statistics come from an article written 15 years ago, and the original source, Capitol Hill Blue, has removed the original article from its website. Congress’ record isn’t blemish-free, by any means, but these statistics have no basis in fact. We rate this meme Pants on Fire!

pomt-14022	"We're losing thousands of (veterans) waiting on line" because they can't get speedy health care from the Veterans Administration.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-thousands-veterans-die-waiting-treatm/	During a news conference called by Donald Trump to explain where money went from a veterans fundraiser, the presumptive Republican nominee for president was asked about the Veterans Administration health system. "I'm entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. The VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country," he said. "People are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They're dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of, if they can't get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they're gonna go see a doctor and the country's going to pay for it. They're going to a private doctor, or a public hospital, or a public doctor but someplace that can take care (of them) immediately. We're losing thousands of people waiting on line." We looked at this issue in October when Trump contended that, "Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care." At the time, he didn't explain where he got the estimate, but it dovetailed with a Sept. 2, 2015, report from the VA Office of Inspector General that tried to investigate a claim that 47,000 veterans died because the VA didn't process their health care applications in a timely manner. We rated Trump's claim Mostly False for several reasons, one of which was, as the report clearly stated, that 300,000 number — actually 307,173 — was an upper limit, reflecting the maximum number of unprocessed enrollment applications where, according to Social Security records, the applicant had died. But because the VA recordkeeping was so horrible, the report concluded, "we cannot determine specifically how many pending (enrollment system) records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied." As PolitiFact reported last year, investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. For example, the count is complicated by the fact that VA services include home loans and disability payments, some health care to family members of veterans and non-veteran employees of the VA system, and people receiving humanitarian care. In addition, in 2013, the VA added millions of records from other arms of the agency into the mix. Many of those ended up in the pending file because the software didn't allow a determination of whether the people were actually applying for medical care. Thus, an accurate count was impossible. However, Trump's new assertion backs off the 300,000 claim dramatically. At the news conference, he simply said that "thousands" had died waiting for health care from the VA, a disturbing but still far more modest claim. Having close to 2,000 instances would qualify as "thousands," so if just 1 percent of the 307,173 records logged by the inspector general were cases of veterans dying before their paperwork could be processed, his claim would clear the bar. Clearly, deadly delays do happen. Investigators looking into operations at the urology unit of the Phoenix VA reported in 2015 that 1,484 cancer patients experienced significant delays in their care, 10 "were placed at 'unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.' At least half of those died," according to the Washington Post. CNN concluded in 2014 that it had identified 19 people who had died because of delays in getting simple medical screens at VA hospitals around the country. At one, the Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, S.C., at least six people had died. "At the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Ga., the VA said three veterans died as a result of delayed care," CNN reported. In addition, the VA system is huge, with 1,550 sites providing some type of health care. It wouldn't take many cases at each site to have thousands dying because they couldn't get a timely appointment. We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the statistic, but didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "We're losing thousands of (veterans) waiting on line" because they can't get speedy health care from the Veterans Administration. Similar claims that 300,000 died because of delays by the VA clearly don't have hard evidence to back them up. Instances at individual VA hospitals seldom go into double digits, so there's no hard evidence there that the number of deaths is in the thousands either.

pomt-15290	The United States is "fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/23/jon-stewart/fact-checking-jon-stewarts-last-daily-show-intervi/	President Barack Obama thanked retiring Daily Show host Jon Stewart for being a "great gift to the country" in the commander in chief’s seventh and final appearance on the show with Stewart as its leader. "I can’t believe that you’re leaving before me," Obama said, adding that he would be issuing a new executive order that Stewart cannot leave. When the laughs died down, Stewart tried to press Obama for serious answers about the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East relations. "Let me ask you a question about Iran. Whose team are we on in the Middle East?" Stewart said. "So we're fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis." "That’s not quite right," Obama laughed, "but that’s okay." Obama went on to call Iran an anti-American, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic adversary that sponsors terrorist organizations, but he never said what wasn’t quite right about the relationships that Stewart described. We wanted to fact-check Stewart on the United States’ complicated ties in the Middle East. Was Stewart right in saying that Iran was a U.S. ally against ISIS and an enemy in Yemen? U.S. and Iran against ISIS While both the United States and Iran are fighting against ISIS, they are not cooperating or fighting as allies. Iran is not included as part of the 60-member coalition the United States has assembled to fight ISIS. Stewart overstated the Iran-U.S. relationship, said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. Even though the United States and Iran are on the same side in fighting ISIS, the nations are not allies. Iran wants more influence in the area than the United States wants it to have. "Iran has the longstanding goal of establishing itself as a prominent power in the region," Brennan said. Iran wants a "weak and stable" Iraq that will acquiesce to Iran’s goals. Iran’s support of certain Shia militias in Iraq is also a reason that the United States has "expressed concerns about Iran’s role in Iraq," said Alistair Baskey, White House National Security Council spokesman. Shia militias often target Iraqi Sunnis (and vice-versa) in a conflict that dates back centuries. So even though the Shia militias are part of a broader front against ISIS, Brennan said they are still the same people responsible for killing Americans in previous conflicts. One example is Abu Mohandis (also known as Jamal Jafaar Mohammed), the current leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (the sum total of all Shia militias in Iraq) who was responsible for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait. He acted in the capacity of an "Iranian agent in Iraq" according to a 2007 CNN article. Another reason why the United States refuses to openly support or work as an official ally of Iran: It is a staunch supporter of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. The United States opposes Assad’s regime and has called for Assad to "step aside" multiple times as the government brutally cracked down on its people, including the regime’s chemical weapon attacks on Syrian citizens dating back to 2012. The battle in Yemen Now for the other arrangement Stewart described: Is the U.S. fighting against Iran in Yemen? Not directly. The United States continues to "provide logistical and intelligence support" to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of the Gulf Cooperation Council fighting the Houthi militia in Yemen, Baskey said. The coalition includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. (Oman is not a member of the coalition, although it is a member of the GCC.) The Houthi militia forces have rallied against Yemen’s president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who took office in 2012 but was forced to resign by Houthi rebels in January 2015. (On Feb. 6, 2015, Houthi rebels announced Mohammed Ali al-Houthi as the president of their Revolutionary Committee). Analysts said Iran is suspected of arming, training and equipping Houthi militia. According to a Defense News article, the United States was "monitoring" Iranian ships that may have been delivering weapons to Houthi military. The Iranian government has officially denied helping Houthi forces, according to a BBC article. However, neither Iran nor the United States is doing the actual fighting in Yemen. " ‘We’ are not fighting in Yemen – though U.S. Special Forces may be involved," said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation. "It is the Saudis who are doing the fighting." Several experts also pointed out that Stewart was wrong about Iraq’s participation in Yemen. "We are not aware of any Iraqi involvement in the Yemen conflict," Baskey confirmed. Our ruling Stewart said the United States is "fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis." As Obama pointed out, Stewart's claim is off on a few points — Iran is not an official ally of the United States against ISIS even though both countries are fighting the terrorist group; the United States is not directly fighting Iran in Yemen; and Iraqi soldiers are not involved in the Yemen conflict. But Stewart's overall perspective that the United States and Iran are in the unusual position of fighting against the same enemy in one country and working against each other in another is not too far off the mark. His statement is partially accurate but lacking in some details. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-04941	Says Minnesota has more Fortune 500 companies than Oregon and "one of the most obvious differences is they've invested in their schools."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/27/jefferson-smith/has-oregon-lost-out-fortune-500-business-because-l/	Portland Public Schools is eyeing a bond vote during the November election to help rebuild and refurbish aging school buildings. During a recent school board hearing on the issue, Portland mayoral candidates Jefferson Smith and Charlie Hales sat together and spoke out in favor of the idea. Learning is the priority, they said, but the environment plays a big role in just how well students learn. During his testimony, Smith sought to silence critics who might question the timing of the bond, given how depressed the economy remains. The fact is, he said, that education is inextricably tied to a healthy economy in the state. The connection between the economy and education becomes clear, he said, "when we understand and compare what's happened in Minnesota, when in 1980 they had 10 Fortune 500 companies and so did Oregon, and now they have 19 and we have two. "And the biggest difference has not been tax rates -- they've been paying more taxes -- one of the most obvious differences is they've invested in their schools." Several studies have shown Smith’s larger point to be true: Education and economics are linked. But, we wondered, was his example comparing Oregon to Minnesota apt? We checked it out. We started with the number of Fortune 500 companies. Those are easy to get; Fortune Magazine keeps an online list of them. Smith was right as far as the current numbers go. Oregon is home to two of the 500 companies -- Nike and Precision Castparts -- while Minnesota is home to 19. As for how things looked 30 years ago, Smith is off. Thirty years ago, Oregon was home to six Fortune 500 companies while Minnesota had 11. Next up, we looked at state tax burdens. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research organization has numbers as recent as 2009 on its website. According to the foundation, Oregon’s tax burden is 9.8 percent of income which puts it at No. 17 nationally -- with No. 1 having the highest burden. Minnesota meanwhile has a burden of 10.3 percent, putting it at No. 7. (When we contacted the Smith campaign, manager Henry Kraemer also pointed to the Foundation’s Business Tax Climate Index, which was updated this year. According to that index Minnesota is one of the worst places to do business and comes in at No. 45, while Oregon ranked far higher at No. 13.) The last bit was education funding. For that, we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to figures from the 2009-10 school year -- the most recent available -- Oregon spent about $9,600 per student, while Minnesota spent $10,700. Now, that $1,000 or so might not seem like a lot, especially given that New York State spends nearly $19,000 per student, but it’s enough to put Minnesota just over the national average while Oregon comes in just below. Except for the discrepancy on the number of 500 companies in both states 30 years ago, Smith seemed to be right, as far as the facts go. A question lingered, however: Was Smith right to link the education being provided in Minnesota to its more robust business climate? John Gallup, an assistant professor of economics at Portland State University, said that the link "does have a good basis in terms of research … companies can't get their employees to move unless there are good school districts." He forwarded us an email from his colleague, James Wood, another assistant professor of economics, who cited one study from Paul D. Gottlieb called "Residential Amenities, Firm Location and Economic Development" done back in 1995 that shows "positive influence of teachers and expenditures per pupil on firm location." We also tried Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. He agreed that education is a potential draw for companies as they seek to hire employees of a high caliber. That said, he wasn’t so sold on the idea that Fortune 500 companies might pick Minnesota over Oregon for the schools, however good they may be. "I'd be willing to bet that most of that location is an accident of history," Duy said. When we spoke to Smith, he said he didn’t disagree with that but added "the importance of education is not merely to attract businesses ... but also to grow them and to help them adapt to a changing environment. "If we meaningfully invested in education now, it would pay dividends." There are a number of points to consider when ruling on this one. Smith was right on a couple things: Oregon has two Fortune 500 companies, while Minnesota has 19. Meanwhile, Oregon’s tax climate is friendlier to businesses and Minnesota spends more per student. He was off on the figures from 1980, however. As for the connection between education and the number of 500 companies in a given state, that’s a little dicier. Certainly, there’s evidence that businesses consider education when locating, but would an extra $1,000 a year for the next couple decades mean we’d catch up with Minnesota? Probably not. Oregon used to be above the national average in per-student funding and we still didn’t rank high in the number of Fortune 500 companies. There are dozens of factors for a business to consider. That said, Smith’s central point here is accurate -- better education is important to business -- and most of his numbers stand up. But we think it’s important to understand that improving education, while important, won’t necessarily lead to dozens of Fortune 500 companies locating in Oregon. We’ll call this one Mostly True.

pomt-00327	"Close to half of the children" in California are "at or near poverty," when you consider cost-of-living.	true	/california/statements/2018/sep/19/gavin-newsom/true-nearly-half-californias-children-are-or-near-/	Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently described California as both "the richest and poorest state." The economy is booming for many, he said, while millions of others are mired in poverty. That includes nearly half of the state’s children, when considering the state’s high "cost-of-living," he claimed. "Close to half of the children (are) at or near poverty," Newsom said while campaigning in Los Angeles County on Sept. 10, 2018. "How can that be in this place, this extraordinary place, in the world’s 5th largest economy? We must do more and we must do better." Did Newsom get his facts right on this sad statistic? We set out on a fact check. Our research Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim is supported by the July 2018 report "Child Poverty in California." That study produced an updated look at what researchers call the California Poverty Measure, which is a joint research effort by the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality to closely examine poverty in the state. It found that 45.8 percent of children in California were "at or near poverty" in 2016, the most recent year examined. That matches with Newsom’s statement of "close to half." But we wanted to know how researchers came up with that number. Caroline Danielson, a PPIC policy director and co-author of the study, said the California Poverty Measure takes into account California’s high cost-of-living, as well as factors that offset those costs, such as the state’s social safety net programs. The report found the share of children in poverty was 21 percent. It found an additional nearly 25 percent lived "near poverty," meaning their family incomes was one-and-a-half times the poverty line, Danielson said. In the report, the income threshold for poverty varies by region. In a high-cost county, including many places along the coast, the average threshold for a family of four is $30,000 per year, Danielson explained. A family that makes less than that would be considered in poverty. In that same county, near poverty includes families whose incomes range from $30,000 to $45,000, or one-and-a-half times the poverty line. Other counties had lower income thresholds. To reach 45.8 percent figure, the study combined children who live at or near poverty in all regions of the state. Danielson said the state’s child poverty rate has declined from 25 percent in 2011, the first year PPIC produced the California Poverty Measure, to 21 percent in 2016. Census figures also support claim The finding that nearly half of California’s children live at or near poverty is also supported by data in the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. An updated version of that report, which also takes into account cost-of-living, was released this month. For 2016, it found 22.5 percent of California’s children live in poverty while a total of 45 percent live at or near poverty, according to a review of that report’s 2016 public-use dataset conducted by Danielson at our request. The Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers over the agency’s Official Poverty Measure, which does not take state-by-state variations in cost into account. Two researchers, however, raised questions in a recent op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle about relying too much on that measure. David Brady, professor of public policy and director of the Blum Initiative on Global and Regional Poverty at UC Riverside and Zachary Parolin, a researcher at the University of Antwerp’s Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, asked "whether California’s poverty rate should depend so exclusively and overwhelmingly on housing costs." They proposed using questions about median income, alongside the supplemental poverty measure, to arrive at poverty rates. This isn’t the first claim we’ve fact-checked on California’s dismal poverty rate. In January 2017, we rated True a claim by Republican Assemblyman Chad Mayes that California had the nation’s highest overall poverty rate, when including children and adults and factoring in cost-of-living. Mayes, at the time, was citing the state’s 20.6 percent overall poverty rate for the period 2013 to 2015. That rate has dropped slightly but remains the highest in the nation at 19 percent, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017. Newsom’s plan for child poverty Newsom has described California’s child poverty as "a moral outrage." His campaign website includes several proposals for reducing it. They include, among other plans, creating college savings accounts for every incoming kindergartener; expanding the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for very low-income earners; and increasing CalWORKS grants, a financial assistance program for families in need. Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed "close to half of the children" in California are "at or near poverty," when you consider the state’s cost-of-living. A July 2018 report by the Public Policy Institute of California backs up Newsom’s statement. It accounts for cost-of-living in each region of the state and found 45.8 percent of the state’s children live at or near poverty. Another report, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, also confirms the claim. Newsom’s statement is supported by credible reports and includes necessary context.

pomt-04451	Says Chris Christie created "this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/11/barbara-buono/chris-christie-created-new-category-denies-unemplo/	For a certain group of New Jerseyans, losing their jobs can mean being denied unemployment benefits indefinitely, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono. The Middlesex County Democrat recently claimed that Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, created that new category of unemployed persons when he reformed the state’s unemployment insurance law in 2010. "A few years ago, the governor -- in so-called reform of the unemployment law -- created...this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever," Buono said in an Oct. 1 interview on NJToday. Buono’s statement is essentially correct. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials in 2010 created a category where individuals fired for "severe misconduct" could be barred from receiving unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed. But the Democrat-led state Legislature bears responsibility for signing off on Christie’s proposed changes. Also, if someone gets another job after being fired for severe misconduct, it’s possible for the wages from that first job to ultimately count toward unemployment benefits. Buono used the phrase "laid off," but state regulations typically refer to such individuals as being "discharged" or "fired." First, let’s explain what severe misconduct means. The state originally had two categories of misconduct cases: misconduct and gross misconduct. Gross misconduct related to behavior that was criminal in nature. Misconduct applied to everything else. State officials created a third category of severe misconduct to recognize behavior that was worse than simple misconduct, but still fell short of being gross misconduct. Examples of severe misconduct include the use of drugs or alcohol on the job and the destruction or theft of company property. Christie recommended adding that category when he conditionally vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature to change the unemployment insurance tax rates paid by employers. Buono voted against accepting the governor’s proposed changes, but most other legislators voted in favor of them and Christie signed the bill into law in July 2010. "It was a bi-partisan effort to make it a fairer system," Harold Wirths, commissioner of the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in a statement. Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, maintained that Christie created the category, pointing out that it didn’t exist until he added it to the bill through his conditional veto. From July 2010 to August 2012, 15,961 unemployment benefit claims were denied for severe misconduct, according to labor department data. However, there’s still a chance a person fired for severe misconduct could ultimately receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job. Here’s how it works: Employment benefits are based on wages earned during a 52-week period called a "base year." Let’s say that after being fired for severe misconduct, that person gets another job, meets certain employment criteria and then loses that job for reasons not related to misconduct. If both jobs occurred within the same base year, then the person could cite both sets of wages to calculate his unemployment benefits, according to department spokesman Brian Murray. But Zuk argued the new category still means individuals won’t receive benefits after they first become unemployed due to "severe misconduct." "Therefore an individual who finds him or herself unemployed due to ‘severe misconduct’ will have no means of sustaining themselves until they find another job," Zuk said in an e-mail. "The DOL spokesperson's statement only becomes relevant if the unemployed individual finds a new job and re-qualifies for benefits." Our ruling In a TV interview, Buono claimed Christie created "this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever." The senator’s claim isn’t far off. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials created a "severe misconduct" category in which individuals could be denied unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed. But the Legislature agreed to create that category as well. Also, there is a scenario in which a person fired for severe misconduct could later receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-08801	"Some Republican leaders in Congress" are "pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/	On the 75th anniversary of Franklin Roosevelt signing Social Security into law, President Barack Obama dusted off an old campaign attack during his weekly address, claiming that Republicans once again intend to privatize the program. We couldn't recall any members of the Republican leadership recently calling for such a drastic change, and so we decided to check out whether this was a legitimate issue or a trumped up scare tactic heading into the fall election season. Obama raised the issue in an address titled, "Honoring Social Security, Not Privatizing It." "One thing we can’t afford to do though is privatize Social Security – an ill-conceived idea that would add trillions of dollars to our budget deficit while tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market," Obama said. Obama noted that this was a debate dating to 2005 when then President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts. Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam (perhaps, in part, because Democrats then labeled the plan as "privatization"), and it died without even being introduced as proposed legislation. "I’d have thought that debate would’ve been put to rest once and for all by the financial crisis we’ve just experienced," Obama said. "I’d have thought, after being reminded how quickly the stock market can tumble, after seeing the wealth people worked a lifetime to earn wiped out in a matter of days, that no one would want to place bets with Social Security on Wall Street; that everyone would understand why we need to be prudent about investing the retirement money of tens of millions of Americans. "But some Republican leaders in Congress don’t seem to have learned any lessons from the past few years. They’re pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall." If this all sounds familiar, you may recall that during the presidential campaign, Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to "privatize" Social Security. We ruled that claim Barely True. So why reintroduce the attack now? White House officials pointed us toward the "Roadmap for America’s Future," a bill from Rep. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. The plan includes a proposal to allow people under 55 to steer a portion of their payroll taxes toward an individual retirement account of their choosing, but overseen by the Social Security Administration. We decided to look at Obama's claim from two angles. First, is it fair to describe Ryan's plan as "privatizing" Social Security? And second, is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? Is Ryan's plan to "privatize" Social Security? Ryan's plan -- which is similar but not identical to Bush's -- would allow workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government (Ryan calls them "personal retirement accounts"). But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security. To start, for those currently 55 and older, the current Social Security System would not be affected one way or another; they would simply receive their benefits as they are set up today and could not opt into a personal account. And for those under 55, the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as they have been promised. And lastly, for those who do choose to create a personal retirement account, the plan would only allow -- over time -- for people to invest a little over a third of their payroll taxes in the personal account. In an e-mail response to PolitiFact, Ryan argued that it would be incorrect to call even the personal retirement account portion "privatized." "In the personal-accounts system, the accounts are owned by the individual, and managed and overseen by Social Security — not a stockbroker or private investment firm," Ryan stated. "People choosing the reformed system select from a handful of government-regulated options — just as Members of Congress and federal employees do." Not everyone agrees. An analysis of Ryan's "Roadmap" plan from the left-leaning Center of Budget and Policy Priorities, argues that, "what makes these accounts private is their ownership, not their oversight or management." We think one could make a plausible argument that the Ryan plan would establish a partially privatized plan. But Obama's sweeping characterization that Republicans are attempting to privatize Social Security seems to be one (big) part scare tactic. When Obama talks about "tying your benefits to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market," it seems to suggest that the plan would affect the benefits being paid to people currently getting Social Security, but those people would be specifically excluded from creating personal retirement accounts because they would only be available to those under 55. Which brings us to the second part of our analysis: Is Ryan's plan a key part of the legislative agenda being pursued by Republican leadership in Congress? It certainly doesn't appear so. Ryan's bill has 13 co-sponsors (all Republicans); and the White House correctly notes that among them are Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., the Republican Study Committee Chairman, and Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Ca., Assistant Republican Whip. Specifically and conspicuously, however, among those who have not signed on as co-sponsors are the big three in Republican leadership: House Republican Leader John Boehner, Republican Whip Eric Cantor and the Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence. According to Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, "As Rep. Ryan and Republican leaders have made clear repeatedly, the Roadmap is Rep. Ryan's vision of long-term conservative reform. It is not an official position of House Republicans in any way, shape or form. Boehner has thanked Rep. Ryan for offering this vision - but he has not co-sponsored or endorsed it, nor has any other member of the House Republican Leadership." Nor does the plan appear to have much traction among Senate Republican leaders. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, noted that McConnell has said he hopes the Obama-created deficit commission will come forward with a Social Security plan he and other Republicans can support. "I don’t know of a single plan (including Rep. Ryan's) that would take the Social Security that seniors currently have and subject it to 'the whims' of Wall Street," Stewart added. "The White House doesn’t know of any either. ... The president falsely claimed that Republican leaders in Congress are trying to take current benefits from seniors and put them in the stock market." Stewart suggested Obama's comments may be prompted by the results of a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that showed the the Democrats' lead on the question of which party would do a better job on ‘dealing with Social Security’ is now down to only 4 points (30 percent to 26 percent); compared to a 28 point advantage for Democrats on that question in October 2006. As we noted earlier, Obama has gone to this well before. Accusing Republicans of trying to privatize Social Security no doubt scores political points with many, particularly seniors who depend on it. But as it was during the campaign, Obama's warning is a big stretch. The only "Republican leader" who is really talking about allowing personal retirement accounts is Ryan, and even his plan is a far cry from a wholly privatized system. We rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00683	"Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/06/peter-schweizer/clinton-cash-author-hillary-changed-positions-indi/	As a senator, Hillary Clinton flip-flopped on a nuclear deal with India -- swayed by donations to her family’s foundation. At least that’s what Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer asserts. Schweizer’s book -- which hit shelves May 5 -- purports to document a series of donations to the Clinton Foundation and other financial gifts that turned into special favors from Clinton while she was a senator and secretary of state. One such allegation, which Schweizer discussed in a May 1 interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell, is that Clinton did not support a nuclear deal with India in 2006, but two years and millions of India-based donations to her foundation later, she changed her mind. But is this an accurate account? Mitchell said MSNBC’s research found that Clinton supported the nuclear deal with India all along. Schweizer responded that in 2006, Clinton supported nuclear cooperation -- with restrictions, which didn’t suit the Indian government’s position. But in 2008, she no longer supported those restrictions. This is evidenced by her votes on amendments that would have put limitations on the deal, he said. "Amendments she supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," he said. Who’s right here? Did Clinton change position or not? We decided to look for ourselves and see if we could sort it out. Apples and oranges First, a very brief chronology. Congress first took up the issue of a civilian nuclear trade deal with India in 2006. That year, they passed legislation to change existing atomic energy law, necessary for the negotiations to move forward. Then in 2008, following diplomatic negotiations, Congress approved the final deal, which allowed the United States to export to India nuclear fuel and technology. Clinton, a founding member of the Senate India Caucus, supported both measures. In 2006, Clinton released a public statement praising the legislation and voted for the final bill. In 2008, she voted for the deal, and the Indian press said Clinton had expressed her support in meetings with Indian leaders. What about the amendments? In 2006, Clinton did vote in the Senate in favor of three failed amendments that would have placed some limitations on the deal: One required India to end military cooperation with Iran, another called for assurances that the deal would not help India develop nuclear weapons, and the third declared support of a United Nations resolution regarding nuclear disarmament. Some supporters of the deal said these amendments could kill the deal. Schweizer said Clinton no longer supported these amendments when Congress revisited the nuclear deal two years later. However, the 2008 bill only had one Senate amendment, and it was defeated by voice vote, meaning the votes were not recorded. Without a recorded vote, or any public comment from Clinton, it’s impossible to know whether she supported the 2008 amendment or not. Further, the single 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than the amendments voted on in 2006. It laid out implications for the deal in the event that India detonated a nuclear weapon, while none of the 2006 amendments addressed this question. So not only is comparing Clinton’s position on the 2006 and 2008 amendments impossible, given the fact that there is no documentation of Clinton’s support or opposition in 2008 -- but the amendments are apples and oranges that don’t offer a meaningful comparison. We want to note that Schweizer pointed us to two statements of Indian business leaders to show that Clinton did not support the deal in 2006, though they aren’t without holes. On June 29, 2006, the leader of the conservative Indian-American Republican Council, said Clinton had "made little effort to support the agreement despite being India Caucus co-chair." However, Clinton put out a press release on the same day that said she intended to vote for the legislation, noting that the Senate version was an improvement upon the White House version. Hotelier Sant Chatwal -- a major fundraiser for the Clintons who was recently found guilty of skirting campaign finance laws -- advocated for the nuclear deal, and he said (in 2010) that Clinton didn’t favor the deal as of May 2006. But again, she expressed public support about a month later. Maybe Chatwal helped change her mind between May and June 2006, or maybe not. Either way this does not show a change in position from 2006 to 2008. Our ruling Schweizer said, "Amendments (Hillary Clinton) supported and voted for in 2006, she no longer supported in 2008," showing she changed positions on an India nuclear deal. We know Clinton voted for several amendments on Indian nuclear deal-related legislation in 2006. The 2008 legislation, however, had just one amendment, and the vote was not recorded. Because we don’t know how she voted, and she did not make any public statements about it, it’s impossible to know her position on the 2008 amendment. Additionally, the 2008 amendment was fundamentally different than any of the amendments the Senate considered in 2006. Even if we knew whether she supported the 2008 amendment, it wouldn’t necessarily show a change in position. What’s more, Clinton showed public support for a deal in 2006, and she voted in favor of the deal in both 2006 and 2008. We rate Schweizer’s claim False.

pomt-02311	"Ralph Hall has never voted to raise the debt ceiling."	false	/texas/statements/2014/mar/31/cat-pac/us-rep-ralph-hall-texas-voted-increase-debt-limit-/	You have to go a long way back to trace U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s voting record. A conservative political action committee claimed the Northeast Texas Republican "has never voted to raise the debt ceiling" in a mail flier forwarded March 10, 2014, to PolitiFact Texas by Matt Mackowiak, an adviser to his challenger in the May 27, 2014, primary runoff for the GOP nomination. Hall, who faces former U.S. Attorney John Ratcliffe, was elected to Congress in 1980 and has served 17 terms; he’s the oldest serving House member in history, as PolitiFact wrote March 20, 2014, in a fact-check rating False a charge that Hall was "the oldest member in Congress ever." Since 1980, there have been more than 50 votes to raise the debt ceiling, which caps how much the U.S. government can borrow to carry out everything budgeted by Congress. And during Hall’s tenure, the limit has never been reduced. But did Hall, who promises in a campaign ad that he "won’t raise the debt ceiling, ever," never vote before to increase the cap? Debt ceiling votes tend to split on party lines. Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to push through the politically ticklish vote to raise the limit, while the other party gets a free run at criticizing the hike and voting against it. Memorably, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., voted against raising the ceiling in 2006 when the Republican president, George W. Bush, sought an increase. Hall has been on both sides of that partisan divide, serving as a Democrat (albeit a conservative one) until Jan. 5, 2004, when he switched to the GOP. Click here to visit the Washington Post’s interactive graphic on increases in the debt ceiling, updated Feb. 11, 2013 and spanning most of U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall’s time in Congress. We called and emailed the Conservatives Acting Together PAC for information on its claim and didn’t hear back. Hall campaign spokesman Ed Valentine told us by phone that the campaign wasn’t involved with the mailer. Mackowiak told us by email that contrary to the PAC’s claim, Hall voted seven times to raise the ceiling from December 1985 through April 2005 -- twice under President Ronald Reagan, twice under President BIll Clinton and three times under Bush. Mackowiak’s breakdown almost entirely holds up, though we found that some of Hall’s votes for raising the ceiling were wrapped into other House decisions. According to the House clerk’s office and the Congressional Record, Hall voted five times in favor of raising the ceiling, though most of these instances were not pure votes on elevating the ceiling. Such increases were, for example, wrapped into the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In the other two cases Mackowiak cited, one each in 1985 and 2005, the ceiling-hike resolutions were passed by the House as a whole, rather than by individual representatives voting. This came about under the Gephardt rule, named after former Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., which operated on the premise that if representatives had voted for the budget, they had intended to fund everything in the budget, and it was thus not necessary to force them to take the potentially unpopular step of voting to raise the debt limit separately. In 2005, Hall voted for the House budget measure that triggered the debt limit hike. But in 1985, he voted against the original House version of the budget that was wrapped into the resolution the Senate approved -- so under the logic of the Gephardt rule, Hall presumably did not approve the debt limit increase that came with that budget. Hall votes: April 28, 2005, House Joint Resolution 47 deemed passed. Hall voted for the budget measure that triggered it. Nov. 18, 2004, vote for Senate Bill 2986. June 27, 2002, vote for Senate Bill 2578. July 30, 1997, vote for House Resolution 2015. March 28, 1996, vote for House Resolution 3136. Aug. 14, 1986, vote for House Resolution 5395. Dec. 11, 1985, House Joint Resolution 372 deemed passed. Hall voted against House Concurrent Resolution 152, which was wrapped into Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the approval of which triggered HJR 372. Our ruling The PAC said, "Ralph Hall has never voted to raise the debt ceiling." We didn’t have to look further than the votes cited by his opponent’s campaign to find six instances from 1986 through 2005 in which Hall backed debt-limit increases. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-09908	"In North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job, apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-claims-city-uses-stimulus-money-hire-someo/	And now, the story of little Washington meets big Washington. In a tongue-in-cheek Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner, the GOP "releases the dogs on the money trail" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. Ellie Mae, the GOP's job-sniffing bloodhound, found two things of interest. We dealt with one, the impact of a federally funded bridge on Rusty's Backwater Saloon in Stevens Point, Wis., with this Truth-O-Meter ruling . Here we'll address Ellie Mae's discovery that "in North Carolina, they used stimulus money to hire one new state worker. His job: apply for more stimulus funds from the taxpayers by the way of the federal government." Which brings us to little Washington ... Washington, N.C., population around 10,000. This small city in the inland coastal region of North Carolina first came under the national microscope with the release of a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called "100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion." At No. 65 on Coburn's list of questionable stimulus projects: "Washington, North Carolina, is using stimulus funds to pay for 'project-funding manager' whose job it is to secure even more stimulus funds. The city hopes to pay the new 'project funding manager' to identify available stimulus money using a $40,234 grant from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program which, in turn, received funding through the stimulus bill." We called Washington, N.C., city officials to get to the bottom of this. First off, the city of Washington did hire someone in late February whose job it is to seek out stimulus money for which the city might be eligible. The part-time job was titled "stimulus coordinator" and was performed by Bianca Gentile. But Gentile wasn't paid through stimulus money. Her wages have been "100 percent paid with local fire, police, water utility, sewer utility and electric utility funds," according to the City Manager James C. Smith in a letter to the Office of Economic Recovery and Investment in North Carolina. The city's top priority these days is building a new police station. The current building is more than 40 years old. It's "way too small for the size of our force," said Mayor Judy Jennette. And it's also prone to flooding during hurricanes, which is especially troublesome because the city's 911 dispatchers are housed there too. The estimated cost — $12 million. With 24 percent of Washington's citizens categorized as low income, Jennette said, the price tag is just too steep for local taxpayers to bear alone. One of the stimulus opportunities identified by Gentile, the city-paid stimulus coordinator, was a planner who could help the city gets its police station. The city applied for — and got — an Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grant for $40,234 to fund the one-year cost of a Law Enforcement Economic Assistance Coordinator. The stimulus did provide $2 billion to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, so the Boehner ad (and Coburn's report) is correct in saying the position was funded through the stimulus. But the idea that the job can be summarized as simply to "apply for more stimulus funds," is incorrect, Washington, N.C., officials said. Here's how the job description reads: "Under limited supervision, (the coordinator) facilitates and conducts research and statistical analysis related to police and municipal programming. This includes the preparation of various reports, departmental strategic plans and programmatic/project evaluations and reports. The LEDP initiates, conducts, and implements research studies and surveys in support of multiple grant programs to provide a basis for management control, decision making and an improved quality life. Performs related duties as assigned." There are then nine bulleted items under "duties, functions and responsibilities." We won't bore you with all of them, but among them are compiling data for reports on police performance and community development initiatives and attending conferences, conventions and other educational and professional meetings to keep updated on planning methods and administration. And yes, part of one bullet notes that the coordinator will "provide narrative material for grant proposals." In other words, he or she will pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of the police station. But Gentile and other city officials say they're not aware of any stimulus money the city could get for that purpose. Rather, according to Gentile and the mayor, the coordinator will likely target grant funding and/or low-interest loans from USDA, FEMA, Homeland Security and federal and state sources. The job has nothing to do with getting stimulus money, said Gentile, who plans to apply for the job. "To the best of my knowledge, there is no stimulus money available that we could use for a police station," Gentile said. Any responsible local government would try to find as much outside grant money as it can, said Mayor Jennette: "We are simply trying to build a new police station as cost effectively as we can for our citizens." We'll concede that the ad is catchy. It ridicules the stimulus as wasteful and ineffective. And it would be a great zinger if indeed stimulus money had been used to hire someone to get more stimulus money. But that's not supported by the facts. Yes, the city of Washington, N.C., got $40,234 in stimulus money to pay for an employee whose job, in part, will be to pursue federal grant money to help offset the cost of a new police station. But there's a difference between federal grants and the stimulus, and city officials say there doesn't appear to be any stimulus money available for this project. So the ad has a catchy line, but it's not true. We rate it False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-07-07T18:40:23	2009-07-02	['North_Carolina']

The fake news headline said, "Washington State Legislature votes to change its name because George Washington owned Slaves." With 50,267 shares as of Sept. 27, the article says that the state is now named "Soros State," after investor and philanthropist, George Soros for, according to the article, all of his help in eliminating the history of slavery in the United States. However, the Soros State does not exist, because the state of Washington did not change its name. The article was made on a site called www.breakingnews365.net. The About section at the bottom of this site states, "This website is an entertainment website, news are created by users. These are humourous news, fantasy, fictional, that should not be seriously taken or as a source of information." (The poor grammar is how it appears on the page.) The main page of www.breakingnews365.net gives users the option to "prank your friends now" and create his or her own article. It also gives users the option to add a photo and suggests that he or she should make titles that would "make your friends curious." There is also an identical website called www.breakingnews247.net that PolitiFact has reported on before. But if you missed the warning at the bottom of the page and the grammar mistakes within the article, there are other ways to disprove the validity of this article. George Soros is the founder of Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization devoted to strengthening democracy and protecting marginalized communities. In the past, he advocated for Georgetown University to offer financial aid for African-American students "whose forbears were slaves." But unlike what the story claimed, Soros does not have any apparent history of trying to eliminate the history of slavery in the United States. The breakingnews365.net article does not specify when the special session was that would have approved the name change. The Washington State Legislature adjourned its last special session July 20, 2017. The Washington State Legislature’s report of all the bills passed in 2017 contains no mention of a bill that changes the name or a recent special session.

pomt-04550	"Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/27/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-distorts-frank-guintas-voting-re/	Veterans funding was back in the news recently as the U.S. Senate failed to take up a new veterans jobs bill. But, even before the vote, one New Hampshire congressional candidate was already taking aim over the issue. In a television ad, released Sept. 18 in and around New Hampshire, former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, who is once again challenging U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta, charged her opponent with failing to support the country’s veterans. "Tea Party Congressman Frank Guinta voted for billions in cuts to veterans programs," a narrator declares in the ad, "Debt,’ aired on WMUR-TV. "I’m Carol Shea-Porter and I approve this message because our veterans deserve better," she said to conclude the ad. Guinta, a freshman Republican, immediately disputed the ad and organized a rally in Manchester to call attention to his "strong record of supporting our veterans." So, who’s right? We decided to check the records. In the ad, the Shea-Porter campaign points to a number of bills, including H.R. 2055, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, as well as H. Con. Res. 112, the House Republicans’ budget resolution, to support their claim that Guinta voted to cut veterans funding. We’ll look at each one individually. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill was first introduced May 31, 2011. In its original form, the bill proposed about $129.7 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs -- an increase of about $7.85 billion over the 2011 funding level. In March 2011, the bill passed the House with near unanimous support. Guinta joined 410 other House lawmakers from both sides of the aisle passing the bill June 14, 2011 by a 411-5 count, according to Roll Call 418. But, as it moved to the Senate, the legislation was expanded to include funding for a host of other federal programs and departments, including energy and water, financial services, interior and environment, labor and education, among others. When it returned to the House for a vote Dec. 15, 2011, the final version of the bill, now known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, proposed about $124.2 billion in funding for the Veterans Affairs department. This figure fell about $5.5 billion below the initial proposal, and $6 billion less than President Barack Obama’s $130.2 billion funding request. But it still exceeded the 2011 veterans figure, $123.16 billion, by nearly $1 billion -- $991 million, to be exact. This time, however, Guinta voted against the bill, saying it failed to go far enough to reduce government spending. According to Roll Call 941, he was one of 86 Republicans to vote against the bill, which passed 296-121. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law Dec. 23, 2011 "Americans simply can’t afford the high price-tag that accompanies this bill," Guinta said at the time in a written statement. "While there are several provisions in it that I strongly support - and have voted for in the past - the overall spending level was just too high." So, in this case, Guinta initially voted to increase veterans funding, but then, when the legislation was expanded to include other spending, he voted against the bill. But voting against an increase isn’t the same as a vote to cut veterans funding. Now, let’s move onto the House Republicans’ budget resolution. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee and the Republican vice-presidential nominee, first introduced the spending bill in March to set the budget for Fiscal Year 2013 and the budget projections for the nine years to follow. On March 29, Guinta joined 227 of his fellow congressmen and women in supporting the budget, which passed the House 228-191, along party lines. But, the bill stalled as it moved on to the Democrat-controlled Senate, failing to reach the floor for a vote. The bill Guinta supported set V.A. funding at $134.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2013. That total did not meet the president’s $139.7 billion request, but it exceeded 2012 spending by about $6.5 billion, or 4.9 percent. But, White House officials and political analysts alike note the House Republicans’ budget also includes $798 billion in undefined cuts to discretionary spending. Neither Ryan nor other House Republicans have specified where these cuts would come from, leaving analysts to speculate about their impact. Obama campaign officials note that, if applied evenly across the board, the budget could cost the V.A. $11 billion by 2014. And according to Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think thank, the department could lose $2 billion in 2013 and $117 billion over the next 10 years, if the cuts were applied proportionally by department. "How much discretionary funding does Ryan propose for fiscal year 2013 or subsequent years for V.A. medical care?" Kogan wrote in an e-mail. "The answer is that we cannot tell, but it is at risk of cuts, perhaps deep cuts. "Importantly, there are no cuts to veterans (specifically outlined) under this view of the budget. But the fact begs the question of where the remaining $897 billion in cuts will come from," he wrote. Our ruling: With $798 billion in unspecified cuts, the Ryan budget leaves many questions, including what effects those cuts will have on veterans spending. But, amid all the questions and uncertainties, what we do know is the budget plan, supported by Guinta, proposed to increase V.A. spending in 2013. We also know that, contrary to Shea-Porter's claim, Guinta voted to increase the V.A. budget by $6 billion when he voted in favor of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs act last year. However, he ultimately voted against the measure when it returned to Congress in the form of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which added close to a $1 billion in new funding to veterans programs. All things considered, we find it a distortion to say Guinta has voted to cut money for veterans’ programs. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10610	Obama said that "since 1992, the Republicans have had all the good ideas..."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/21/bill-clinton/obama-not-a-reagan-democrat/	Stumping for his wife, Bill Clinton made an eyebrow-raising attack on Sen. Barack Obama, suggesting Obama's allegiance is with Republican ideas. What? "Her (Hillary's) principal opponent said that since 1992, the Republicans have had all the good ideas," Clinton told a crowd in Pahrump, Nev., on Jan. 18, 2008. "…So now it turns out you can choose between somebody who thinks our ideas are better or the Republicans had all the good ideas." At a campaign rally two days later in Buffalo, N.Y., Bill Clinton revisited the attack: "[Obama] said President Reagan was the engine of innovation and did more, had a more lasting impact on America than I did. And then the next day he said, 'In the '90s, the good ideas came out from the Republicans.' " Here's what Obama actually said: "I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different," Obama told the editorial board of the Reno Gazette-Journal on Jan. 14. "I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not." And a little later... "I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom." Hillary Clinton also twisted Obama's words. "I have to say, you know, my leading opponent the other day said that he thought the Republicans had better ideas than Democrats the last 10 to 15 years," she said at an economic roundtable in Las Vegas on Jan. 18. Clinton said she didn't consider it a better idea to privatize Social Security, eliminate the minimum wage, undercut health benefits, shut down the government or drive the country into debt. John Edwards piled on, too: "Ronald Reagan, the man who busted unions, the man who did everything in his power to destroy the organized labor movement, the man who created a tax structure that favored the richest Americans against middle class and working families... we know that Ronald Reagan is not an example of change for a presidential candidate running in the Democratic Party." Instead of a long point-by-point comparison of the politics of Obama versus Reagan, let's just put this to bed by giving Obama's comments a fuller context. During the 49-minute editorial board meeting, Obama was essentially asked how long his coattails might be for other candidates in House and Senate races. His response lasted a few minutes, but here's a bit of what he said: "I think that we're shifting the political paradigm here. And if I'm the nominee, I think I can bring a lot of folks along on my coattails. You know, there's a reason why in 2006, I made the most appearances for members of Congress. I was the most requested surrogate to come in and campaign for people in districts that were swing districts, Republican districts where they wouldn't have any other Democrat. "That was based on their read of the fact that, you know what, this is somebody who can reach out to independents and Republicans in a way that doesn't offend people. … I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what's different are the times. "I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. They felt like, you know, with all the excesses of the '60s and the '70s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating and he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is, people wanted clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing, all right? I think Kennedy, 20 years earlier, moved the country in a fundamentally different direction. So I think a lot of it just has to do with the times. "I think we're in one of those times right now. Where people feel like things as they are going aren't working. We're bogged down in the same arguments that we've been having, and they're not useful." And does this next part sound like a Republican sympathizer? "And, you know, the Republican approach, I think, has played itself out. I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom. Now, you've heard it all before. You look at the economic policies when they're being debated among the presidential candidates and it's all tax cuts. Well, you know, we've done that, we tried it. That's not really going to solve our energy problems, for example. So, some of it's the times. And some of it's, I think, there's maybe a generation element to this, partly ... I didn't come of age in the battles of the '60s. I'm not as invested in them. "And so I think I talk differently about issues. And I think I talk differently about values. And that's why I think we've been resonating with the American people." Steve Falcone, opinion editor for the Reno Gazette-Journal, who led the interview, said he didn't give the comment much thought until it blew up with Bill Clinton's retort. "I was surprised by the way it got spun," Falcone said. "To me, it was in the context of the need for change and leadership," he said. "It was an example that a lot of people can appreciate, that Reagan created a coalition because he had ideas. I didn't think at the time that he was aligning himself with any Republican ideas. It never occurred to me listening to it that he (Obama) was agreeing with the politics of Ronald Reagan." Four days after he visited, the paper endorsed Obama in the Democratic primary. Our take, Obama may want to think twice before invoking the R-word again any time soon. But in this case, it was little more than a sound bite taken out of context and twisted. Obama never said Republicans have all the good ideas. We rate Bill Clinton's statement False. Hillary's too, for that matter.

pomt-08590	Says John Boehner "admits 'we are not going to be any different than we’ve been' " by returning to "the same failed economic policies" that "wrecked our economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/24/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-cites-john-boehner-saying-gop-plans-r/	In their effort to hold a congressional majority, Democrats keep saying that if the Republicans take power, they will return to the policies of former President George W. Bush and the previous Republican majority in Congress -- policies that Democrats blame for helping cause the current recession. The office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used this argument in responding to a Sept. 23, 2010, event in which House Republicans unveiled a "Pledge to America" -- a statement of policy principles that House Republicans intend follow. A Sept. 23 post on Pelosi's "Gavel" blog said, "Answering a question this morning about the preamble to the GOP’s ‘Pledge to America,’ House Republican Leader John Boehner admitted to American workers, their families and small businesses, 'We are not going to be any different than we’ve been.' Finally, we get the truth. Congressional Republicans want to return to the same failed economic policies that cost us 8 million American jobs, doubled our national debt, hurt millions of Americans, and wrecked our economy." The post included an eight-second video clip in which Boehner says, "And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we're not going to be any different than we've been." We wanted to see if Pelosi's post accurately reflected what Boehner, an Ohio Republican, had said at the event. So we listened to the audio recording of the question-and-answer session from which the quote was taken. Here's the full question and answer: Question: "Legislatively, how do you plan to honor families, traditional marriage, life and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values?" Boehner: "I think if you look at House Republicans over the course of the last year, two years -- for that matter, the last 10 years -- you will see that, by and large, we have supported those pro-family, traditional values issues. And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we are not going to be any different than what we've been. We are going to stand up for those things that we believe in." So Boehner was not in fact talking about the party's economic policies. He was answering a question about what he called "pro-family, traditional values issues." Those are two very different things, and the extremely tight editing of the eight-second clip in Pelosi's blog post suggests to us that whoever edited the clip realized that Boehner's full answer would not have made the point they wanted to make. Others have found plenty to criticize about the Republican plan. On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked Republican comments at the Pledge event by intersplicing them with nearly identical statements made by GOP leaders in the past. But it's a gross mischaracterization to make that point by touting Boehner's comment and saying that he was referring to economic policy. Pelosi's office told us they think it's fair to interpret his words broadly. "Leader Boehner, like others in his party, may wish to take his statement back, but he was clearly in an event, speaking about the Republican agenda when he said it," said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami. "The preamble is a prelude to the pledge, which is a roadmap right back to failed policies of the past." That's an opinion that many Democrats share, but we still feel that the Speaker's office significantly distorted Boehner's comments. Even if you believe that the Republicans would indeed return to Bush-era economic policies, it does not justify making that point by twisting Boehner's comment, which was specifically tailored to social issues. Nor does it justify running a video clip that is highly abbreviated and removes all context from Boehner's statement. For these reasons, we rate the blog post Pants on Fire.

pomt-11427	"Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/16/viralpoliticsus/no-proof-putin-issued-arrest-warrant-soros/	Billionaire George Soros is now officially a wanted man in Russia, a viral story would have you believe. "Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros," reads a March 10 headline on Viral Politics US. The story smashes together work by Soros groups in Russia and quotes from a Rolling Stone article that have nothing to do with Soros to create an inaccurate hoax. While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that it issued a warrant for his arrest. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Similar hoaxes about Soros and Putin have circulated since November 2016. Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that President Donald Trump declared Soros a "national security threat". Viral Politics US stated that Russia declared Soros and his organizations a "threat to Russian national security." That phrase is similar to the language used by Russian officials when they banned two Soros charities in 2015. "It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state," stated a translated version of a press statement by Russia's General Prosecutor's Office in November 2015. The Viral Politics US story pulls actual quotes from a 2010 Rolling Stone article about Goldman Sachs including this quote: "The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." Although the Rolling Stone article makes no mention of Soros, the Viral Politics US story tries to create a connection by stating "obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs." Viral Politics US then tosses in a quote by a man named Phil Butler: "George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it,’" Viral Politics US wrote. The online hoax provides no explanation about the identity of Butler, but we found the quote by Butler in an article for the online magazine New Eastern Outlook in July 2016. Butler described Soros as a "real arch villain" and accused Soros of manipulating the 2016 presidential election. Butler describes himself as an analyst and expert on Eastern Europe. While there is no evidence that Putin sought a warrant to arrest Soros, the billionaire has been a major critic of the Russian president and said he believes that Putin has been behind the attacks on him. In January while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros said, "Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Putin’s Russia, are on the rise." In October 2016, Soros criticized Putin for Russia's bombing campaign in Syria calling on him to "put an end to his heinous crimes against humanity." Viral Politics US wrote that "Putin issues international arrest warrant for Soros." While Russia banned two Soros charities in 2015, we found no evidence that Putin issued a warrant for the billionaire’s arrest. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-11543	"Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/12/breitbart/food-stamps-dropped-nationally-after-temporary-spi/	The number of people on food stamps plummeted nationwide in November, according to Breitbart, a conservative news website. "Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month," stated the Feb. 7 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the numbers are accurate, but as the story explained, the decline occurred after a spike as a result of a program to temporarily provide food stamps to people in areas damaged by hurricanes. Ultimately, the number of food stamp clients in November was on par with many of the preceding months before the impacts of Hurricane Irma in Florida and Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Data showed spike followed by decline in food stamps in the fall The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federal government program to help low-income people buy groceries. The average per person monthly benefit was around $126 last year. Breitbart accurately quoted monthly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture which showed that the number of participants in SNAP dropped from about 45.7 million in October 2017 to 41.7 million in November 2017 — a decrease of about four million. Breitbart explained that the decline was preceded by an increase following temporary Disaster-SNAP enrollment in Florida and Texas after the hurricanes. Food stamp clients jumped by about three million between September and October nationwide after the USDA approved Disaster-SNAP for Florida and Texas. Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said that DCF handed out these disaster benefits to 3.1 million people between late September and early December. In Texas, there were 1.6 million individuals served. SNAP acts as a first responder after natural disasters, providing assistance to households that may be vulnerable as a result of their place of employment temporarily closing, or facing expenses due to damage or relocation, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Breitbart’s statement about the four-million drop in one month makes for a catchy headline, but if we put it in context and look at the data over a few months, it showed that the November enrollment of about 41.7 million is in the same ballpark as many of the past several months, for example in May when there were 41.6 million SNAP clients. Experts told PolitiFact that monthly enrollment can fluctuate due to factors such as disaster assistance, so it’s more useful to look at longer stretches such as annual data to understand trends. Food stamps on the decline since 2013 Breitbart accurately noted that food stamp enrollment has been on the decline since fiscal year 2013. Annual SNAP data shows enrollment climbed from about 28.2 million in 2008 to 47.6 million in 2013 and has declined every year since that time. SNAP enrollment hit 42.2 million in 2017. SNAP enrollment fluctuates based on the economy. National enrollment climbed between 2007 and 2013 amid the recession and sluggish initial recovery. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The rising numbers were as a result of expanded eligibility and outreach, which began under President George W. Bush including a commitment to expand funding. Also, the 2009 stimulus package signed by President Barack Obama expanded eligibility. So far there have been no explicit changes implemented to SNAP since Trump took office in January 2017 to give him credit for the decline, said James Ziliak, director of the center for Poverty Research at the University of Kentucky. "To the extent that the economy has continued to grow under President Trump, including rising wages, then to the extent that his policies have not interfered with this pre-existing trend he deserves some credit," he said. The Trump administration has made some moves toward work requirements for people who receive certain government services, including food stamps. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said at a press conference in May 2017 that people need to get a job to be eligible for food stamps going forward: "If you’re on food stamps and you’re able-bodied, then we need you to go to work," he said. The federal government has sought input from the states in an effort to promote employment for food stamp recipients. According to the USDA, many SNAP households already have a person working. Nearly one-third of all SNAP households and 55 percent of households with children had earnings in 2015. We emailed the Breitbart reporter and did not get a reply. Our ruling Breitbart said that "Food stamp enrollment drops by four million in one month." Data from the USDA showed that the number of SNAP participants dropped from about 45.7 million in October to 41.7 million in November, a decrease of about four million. But as Breitbart explained, there was a temporary spike in enrollment due to Disaster-SNAP, including in Florida, as a result of a hurricane. In general, comparing two months doesn’t tell us much about longer-term trends. But Breitbart noted that food stamps have declined since 2013, which is accurate. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01125	Regarding sexual assault against women, "It’s actually safer not to be in college than it is to be in college."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/04/mark-warner/warner-sexual-assualt-its-safer-women-not-be-colle/	U.S Sen. Mark Warner says women in college have a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than those who don’t go. Warner made that statement in a television interview while weighing in on a Rolling Stone article that detailed allegations of a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. The magazine has since backed away from the story. "Statistics show that one out of every five women are victims of sexual assault when they’re on college campuses," Warner said on Fusion. "It’s actually safer not to be in college than it is to be in college." PolitiFact Virginia examined the one-in-five statistic recently while looking at a statement made by State Sen. Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax. We found debate among analysts over that figure. What piqued our interest this time is Warner’s claim that women college students are at a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than their non-college peers, a statement he’s made several times. Warner’s proof Warner spokesman, Kevin Hall, said the senator’s comment was based on a pair of Department of Justice reports as well as a statement from the American Association of University Professors about sexual assault. "Schools are not the safe havens they once appeared to be; college women are at higher risk for sexual assault than their non-college-bound peers," said a 2005 report on campus sexual assault by the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice. NIJ based its conclusion on an early 1997 survey when it asked 4,446 female college students in the U.S. whether they’d been sexually victimized since the start of that school year. Almost 16 percent of the women said they had experienced "victimization," a term that was defined as anything from unwanted touching to forcible rape. But the researchers never surveyed women who were not students. To support their finding that college women are at greater risk of experiencing a sexual crime, they cited academic studies in the late 1980s and 1990s that examined sexual assault on campuses in the U.S. and Canada. One of the studies, published in the journal Criminology, surveyed 3,472 women students at 12 U.S. colleges about sexual victimization during the 1993-1994 academic year. They found that the rate of rape and sexual assault among students on campus was about three times higher than that of all women age 20-24. The researchers -- professors at three universities -- said their results "were suggestive" of a higher rate of sexual assault among college females. But the researchers cautioned that firm conclusions couldn’t be drawn without a systematic study of sexual assault among college students as well and their non-student peers. They, too, did not survey non-students, instead relying on information from the National Crime Victimization Survey. This produced uneven comparisons. And the age range of the women students interviewed by the professors didn’t exactly match the available national data for women ages 20 to 24. What Warner overlooks Warner’s office didn’t mention two studies by another branch of the Justice Department -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics -- that contradictorily concluded college women are safer than their non-college peers. These reports are somewhat more current than the research Warner cited and surveyed identically-aged women, from 18 through 24, attending college and not. The bureau, in a 2003 study, found that from 1995 to 2000 the rape and sexual assault rate among female college students was 6.2 per 1,000 women. The rape and sexual assault rate among female non-students was 7.9 per 1,000. In a follow-up study in 2005, the bureau found that from 1995-2002, the rate of rape and sexual assault was 6.0 per 1,000 women students compared to 7.9 per 1,000 for female non-students. We should point out that on Dec. 11, 2014 -- about a week after Warner made his statement -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics released its first report since 2005 examining sexual assault among women in college and their non-student peers. That report found that from 1995 to 2013, the rate of rape and sexual assault for students was 6.1 per 1,000 compared to 7.6 per 1,000 for non-students. We won’t hold Warner accountable for information released a week after he made his statement. But the previous bureau reports from 2003 and 2005, that contradicted Warner’s claim, were available when he made his statement. You may note that the incidences of campus rape and sexual assault in the bureau studies are lower than those found in other research we’ve mentioned. The bureau says that’s because it conducts a crime survey and its definitions of an offense are narrower than those used in other surveys. The bureau says participants in its survey may not report incidents they don’t think rise to the level of crimes. A statistician at the bureau said the tighter definitions do not diminish its findings. "It’s the only national survey where you can look at the comparison between the students and non-students in terms of violent victimization and sexual assault victimization," said Lynn Langdon, co-author of the recent report. Why would non-college students have higher rates of sexual assault than colleges students? "A likely culprit is disadvantage," emailed Callie Rennison, a former statistician at the bureau who is co-director of the Criminology and Justice Research Initiative at the University of Colorado’s School of Public Affairs. "In general, individuals who have more income, greater education, live in better-off communities (among other things) tend to be characterized by lower rates of violence," she wrote. "I believe this translates to university attendance. That is, those who come from more advantage are also more likely to attend university." A final note: Warner, who has three college-aged daughters, voiced concern about sexual assaults on campuses prior to the publication of the Rolling Stone’s article in November. The senator announced in July that he was cosponsoring a bill that seeks to crack down on campus sexual assault. The measure would require colleges to designate confidential advisors to help victims report crimes. It would mandate an annual anonymous survey in which students at every university would be asked about the prevalence of sexual assaults at their campuses. Our ruling Warner says women students on college campuses are more likely to be sexually assaulted than their peers who don’t seek a higher education. He backs his statement by citing Department of Justice studies that make that same observation based on research from the 1980s and 90s. The researchers acknowledged shortcomings with their methodology and said their conclusions were "suggestive." Warner’s statement ignores a credible and more current body of research that offered an opposite conclusion to his. We rate his statement Mostly False.

"BREAKING: President Trump Pardons Kim Davis," read the headline on an Aug. 26, 2017, post on OurLandOfTheFree.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post appeared after Trump’s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge’s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5. Davis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks’ names off marriage licenses. She had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit. So Davis can’t get a pardon, because technically she wasn’t convicted of a federal crime. But it doesn’t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content. OurLandOfTheFree.com is a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we’ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.

pomt-07831	The United States is "the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/15/herman-cain/obama-should-cut-corporate-tax-rate-potential-gop-/	The next presidential election is just 21 months away, and one potential candidate from Georgia was recently on national television to make an interesting case against incumbent Barack Obama. Herman Cain, a conservative businessman, motivational speaker, author and former radio talk show host, said on CNN that the president does not fully understand how to help the private sector prosper. Case in point, Cain said, the high corporate tax rates the federal government levies on businesses. "We need to lower the top corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent," Cain said Friday on CNN’s "American Morning" program. "We are the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate." Cain, a Henry County resident who unsuccessfully campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, recently started an exploratory presidential committee, the customary first step toward a White House bid. Cain concedes he would be a "dark-horse" candidate, but we’re certain he would get his message out if he runs for president. So we were curious about Cain’s claim on CNN. Is the United States the only developed country in the world that has not cut its corporate tax rate, the percentage that businesses are taxed by the government? The best information on the subject comes from the Doing Business Project, which was started in 2002 to examine business regulations across the globe. Its partners include the World Bank. Each year, the project completes a report that looks at the world’s business climate. AJC PolitiFact Georgia read each one of the project’s Paying Taxes reports, which date back to 2007. During that time frame, we found 48 nations that have cut back their corporate tax rates. The reports do not specify whether the cuts were to statutory rates, which is the taxable income of corporations, or effective rates, which measure the taxes a corporation pays as a percentage of its economic profit. The larger countries that cut their rates included Canada, China, Germany, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. The list included small nations, such as Albania, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Morocco and New Zealand. The United States was not among those countries. During the period covered by the reports, Iceland was the only developed country that raised its corporate tax rate, which increased from 15 percent to 18 percent. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a chart of America’s corporate tax rate that dates back to 1909. It shows the top rate was at its highest, 52.8 percent, in 1968 and 1969. It was last cut between 1987 and 1988, when Ronald Reagan was president, from 40 percent to 34 percent. The top rate last rose in 1993, to its current rate of 35 percent. Some research shows corporate tax revenue typically increases when the rates are lowered because more businesses pay the rates. Cain is not the only conservative to call for a lower corporate tax rate. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., proposed lowering the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent during his failed bid for president in 2008. McCain and others complain that the U.S. has among the highest corporate tax rates in the world. PolitiFact rated a claim by U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that America has the world’s highest corporate tax rate as Mostly True. Obama, by the way, said in last month’s State of the Union address he is open to cutting the top corporate tax rate. The president said in that speech that the U.S. had among the world’s highest corporate tax rates, earning him a True by PolitiFact on the Truth-O-Meter. Emory University law school professor Dorothy Brown contends this point stressed by Cain and others is a red herring. She and others argue that the federal tax code contains many loopholes for businesses that allow them to pay less in corporate taxes. "I quarrel whether there is any meaning," Brown said. "The question is so what?" The big question for us is what time frame was Cain talking about on CNN when he said the U.S. is the only developed country that has notcut its corporate tax rate? The Tax Policy Center chart tells a different story. Efforts to contact Cain via telephone and e-mail were unsuccessful Monday. It has been a while since the United States cut its corporate tax rate. But to say the U.S. is the "only developed country" that has not cut its corporate tax rate is not completely accurate. At least one other one -- Iceland -- has raised the rates. Arguments can be made, however, that Iceland is an anomaly when its economy is compared to major players like the U.S. We believe Cain is trying to make a larger point that many developed countries have lowered their corporate taxes. He argues they should be lowered here in order for America to be competitive with the rest of the world. There is ample evidence that the U.S. is behind the curve on this front, but not everyone is cutting their rates. We find Cain’s statement, and the larger point he is trying to make, is on-point.

pomt-14818	"29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/23/gun-free-ut-gun-free-ut/campus-carry-claims-tangled-definitions/	When Texas lawmakers agreed to allow people to carry concealed handguns in college and university buildings, the law included wiggle room for school presidents and boards to determine rules and regulations for their campuses. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 11 - the "campus carry" measure - into law on June 1, 2015, but the rancorous debate over whether the law willl prevent mass shootings continues. Some groups are using risque tactics to draw attention to their opposition, like the student-organized "Campus Dildo Carry" day, scheduled to take place next summer at the University of Texas in Austin. Gun Free UT, which opposes the law, is taking a more serious approach in its opposition, in part through a website that drew our attention thanks to this claim posted Oct. 28, 2015: "29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." The same day, we took a screenshot of the blog post containing the claim, headlined "Guns in Classrooms: Report from the trenches and tasks." After we asked for some clarification on the relationship between the two sources cited in the claim, the post was taken down. Joan Neuberger, UT professor of history and a co-chair of the Gun Free UT steering committee, said the claim made on the site in a bullet point left no room for nuance. "We can see that our statement needs more context." Still, is the claim -- suggesting mass shooters won’t be stopped even if more students carry weapons -- accurate? We looked first at whether 29 mass shootings have been committed by licensed concealed carriers since 2007. Then we turned to whether only one licensed civilian "meaningfully" intervened in a mass shooting in the period. Counting mass shootings In an Oct. 28, 2015 post, The Washington Post’s Wonkblog cited an Oct. 14, 2015 report from the Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy group that promotes gun control, stating that since 2007, there had been 29 mass shootings by people with concealed weapons in the U.S. The National Rifle Association, which backed SB 11, has taken issue with the center’s breakdown. NRA Institute for Legislative Action spokesman Lars Dalseide directed us to a criticism of the center’s methodology on Bearing Arms, a Second Amendment rights advocacy blog. The Oct. 26, 2015 Bearing Arms post looks at each of the shootings compiled by the center and concludes that only six instances were actually mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders using concealed weapons. That’s a whopping difference. So what gives? For one thing, the Violence Policy Center and Bearing Arms define "mass shootings" differently. In its analysis, the center defined a mass shooting as the killing of three people or more. According to VPC Communications Director Avery Palmer, this definition is "consistent with the federal definition contained in the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012." This is also the definition used in "A Study of Active Shooter Incidents in the United States Between 2000 and 2013," the FBI report from which Gun Free UT pulls its statistic on civilian interventions. On the other hand, the Bearing Arms post author, Bob Owens, defines a mass killing as the killing of four people or more, thus disregarding incidents in which three people were killed. His definition is actually consistent with the FBI definition of a mass murder (as opposed to a mass shooting). In a 2005 report on serial murder, the FBI defined mass murder as "a number of murders (four or more) occurring during the same incident." Only one civilian intervened? We come to the second part of the claim, that "during this period (since 2007), only one licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." Gun Free UT pulls this figure from the aforementioned FBI study on active-shooter incidents. It’s worth noting that while Gun Free UT implies the FBI report contains data on interventions from 2007 through the present, it actually only examines incidents through 2013. According to the report, there were five instances in which "the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters." Gun Free UT did not count four of these incidents because the intervening civilians were security guards armed for their jobs. When we took a closer look at the one case where an armed civilian stopped the shooting, we found something interesting. The FBI report didn’t just look at mass shootings -- it focused on all "active shooter incidents" (in which "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area") during a 13-year period. As it turns out, the situation cited by Gun Free UT was not what either the center or the FBI would define as a mass shooting in that two people died, rather than three. In that case, Ernesto Villagomez, 30, killed two people and wounded two more inside Player’s Bar and Grill in Winnemucca, Nevada. He was then shot and killed by another patron at the bar. Other analyses Unlike the FBI report, the center’s analysis considered only mass shootings committed by concealed carry permit holders. A third tally of mass shootings, published Dec. 15, 2012 by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, found there had been 62 mass shootings over 30 years, with not a single case in which the killing was stopped by a civilian with a gun. The Mother Jones investigation used the more restrictive "mass murder definition"-- four or more killed at once in its count of shootings. Meantime, the Wonkblog post that cited the center’s shooting count reached its own -- higher -- tally of eight instances that someone with a concealed-carry license intervened in a mass shooting situation. That count was attributed to an Oct. 3, 2015, Washington Post blog post, by UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh; two more incidents were added later to his list. In his post, Volokh acknowledged that the effect of more widespread gun possession on the outcome of mass shootings remains unknown. Of his examples, he conceded "at least some examples are ambiguous, because it might be unclear… whether the shooter had been planning to kill more people when he was stopped." By either FBI definition, the death toll only climbed high enough to count as a mass shooting in one of the 10 incidents identified by Volokh. In all the others, it is unsure whether the shooter would have continued shooting had he not been shot himself, making it difficult to do an authoritative count of interventions. For instance, in a 2014 incident at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital near Philadelphia, a psychiatric patient shot his caseworker in the face and wounded his psychiatrist before the psychiatrist shot him. He was then wrestled to the ground. The shooter, Richard S. Plott, had more than 30 additional rounds of ammunition on him when he was stopped. There are drawbacks to any attempt to compile and compare statistics from different sources; there’s also a good reason comprehensive data on gun violence is hard to come by. Since 1996, Congress has restricted research into gun violence with a budget that states: "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." The CDC read the restriction broadly and radically reduced research on gun violence as a result; Obama reversed the funding rule by executive order in 2013. Our Ruling When we looked, the Gun Free UT blog included this claim: "29 mass shootings have been committed by concealed carriers since 2007, while during this period only one (1) licensed civilian meaningfully intervened in a mass shooting." The first Gun Free UT claim is accurate in that in that 29 mass shootings, according to a definition provided by the FBI, were carried out by people with concealed weapons. An attempt by Bearing Arms to refute the claim calls the incidents mass killings, but uses the FBI definition for mass murder. The claims leaves out information that could clarify the tangle of definitions used. By Gun Free UT's own admission, the website claim lacks context. The second claim that only one licensed civilian intervened in a mass shooting is false by the FBI definition of a mass shooting, but bolsters Gun Free UT’s cause because no armed civilian has intervened in a mass shooting. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Gun Free UT Gun Free UT	None	None	None	2015-11-23T16:29:54	2015-10-29	['None']
pomt-14051	"The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-who-cut-funds-wisconsin-university-sy/	The 2015-’16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Walker, irked by no-confidence votes faculty are taking against the system’s leadership, fired attacks on University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors (including one we rated Pants on Fire). Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. "We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it," Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. "But we’ve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. "In fact, by the way," Walker continued, "the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System." With the 2015-’17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walker’s claim that UW System’s budget is the biggest it’s ever been. He’s essentially correct, but with some caveats. ‘All-funds’ budget Walker was referring to the system’s all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts. We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Here’s a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-’11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-’12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-’13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-’14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-’15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-’16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-’16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. That’s because in 2015-’16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasn’t included, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-’15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-’16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the system’s budget. But it’s worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-’74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-’16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: "The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been." The system’s 2015-’16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-’74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-’16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadn’t been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/81a949f8-1bd5-4d36-b133-2b1bc7d897bf	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2016-05-25T05:00:00	2016-05-16	['None']
pomt-13867	Says Hillary Clinton "savaged" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault "and shamed them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-compares-bill-clinton-cosby-at/	Donald Trump has often attacked Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women by accusing her of enabling former president Bill Clinton’s sexual impropriety. A new ad from pro-Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now did the same, citing tweets, excerpts from a New York Times article and Hillary Clinton’s own words. Referring to Bill Clinton's accusers, the ad claims that Hillary Clinton "stage-managed their destruction from a White House war room. She savaged their dignity and shamed them." The video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we’ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any were taken out of context. But before that, there’s some history you need to understand. Accusations The Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton’s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault. Five women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post. Bill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations. Sources other than the Washington Post — such as the conservative website Breitbart — have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed. The pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad’s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We didn't weigh in on those issues. What we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton’s quotes. Let’s go one by one. The ‘Cosby’ tweet The ad says, "When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.’ " The ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until "disbelieved" by evidence. But the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby. The tweet itself links to Clinton’s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence — CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day. The Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian. No evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby. ‘Loony toon’ The ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called her husband’s accusers "loony toon." The "loony toon" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky — whom the Post lists as a consensual affair — as a "narcissistic loony toon." The citation is correctly attributed to Blair’s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine. The ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman — Lewinsky. Experts had differing takes on whether the "Lewinsky affair" was consensual or not. ‘Floozy, bimbo and stalker’ The ad says "The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy, bimbo and stalker.' " Note, it does not say Clinton said these words — which she didn't. The terms are found in a book — Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton — by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article. In the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett — Bill Clinton’s former lawyer — referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a "floozy, bimbo flake." The book attributes the "stalker" remark to Sidney Blumenthal — a former White House aide — speaking with author Christopher Hitchens. The quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate. ‘A lot to answer for’ The ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said "some folks are going to have a lot to answer for." The comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband. "The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president," Clinton said. She goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband’s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are "not going to be proven true." "And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for," she said. This could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various "right-wing" political operatives based on the interview’s prior context. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers. The ad claims Clinton was questioning the accounts of the women involved. Going back to the source, that is not certain. The Clinton camp declined to go on record for this fact-check. Our ruling A pro-Trump advertisement makes several claims about Hillary Clinton’s hypocritical treatment of women, relying primarily on her own words or those of close confidants. The broader message — that Clinton enabled her husband’s alleged sexual assaults — has been and continues to be debated, by pundits and experts alike. We didn't weigh in on those arguments, but we did look into the ad’s more specific use of quotes attributed to Clinton. The quotes themselves are hearsay in some cases and subject to different interpretations based on context. The ad further misleads by saying Hillary Clinton "savaged" the dignity of people who accused Bill Clinton of sexual harassment or assault "and shamed them." We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26258019-ded0-4ed2-aec3-33d9bb6b14d6	None	Rebuilding America Now	None	None	None	2016-07-06T12:00:00	2016-06-23	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-15162	Says "Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama "reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/27/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-blames-bush-raising-deficits-credits/	During the last four presidencies, deficits disappeared under one Democrat (Bill Clinton), went up under two Republicans (George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) and traveled both up and down under one Democrat (Barack Obama). It’s actually a pretty complicated story, but the liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats boiled it down into one graphic on Facebook with five short lines. "Bush Sr. handed Clinton a $269 billion budget deficit. Clinton handed Bush Jr. a $127.3 billion surplus. Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama has reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion. But tell me again which is the party of fiscal responsibility." Facebook users shared this post over 145,000 times, so we thought we’d take a closer look. We asked the group’s founder and editor-in-chief Omar Rivero to explain his numbers, and he offered a small correction. Rivero said the number for the first President Bush should be a deficit of $255 billion, or $14 billion less than stated. "A tiny error, really," Rivero said. "We stand firmly by our meme and its implication that Democrats are better stewards of the debt." We’ll set aside the bigger point and just focus on the numbers and the challenge of awarding credit or placing blame on the person in the Oval Office. In particular, we zero in on the claim that "Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama "reduced Bush Jr.’s deficit to just $492 billion." Rivero said he picked the first year of a new president’s first term and relied on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. We used figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which runs an interactive database for this figure for the Federal Reserve, but the two were largely the same. We color coded the four presidencies and marked the years Rivero picked in red. Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis For the framework Rivero used, and making allowances for his correction, his numbers are fine. In fact, in terms of reducing the deficit, Obama did a little better than the meme said. We should mention the timing of budgets and administrations. The federal fiscal year begins in October. A new president takes office in January and for the most part, typically operates under the budget he inherited. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said for that reason, it’s "reasonable" to use the years that Rivero picked. But there’s a lot more to be said. 2009: Not your typical year The Great Recession hit hard in 2008 and grew worse in 2009. In that period, the unemployment rate doubled from about 5 percent to 10 percent. With Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress and the White House, Washington passed a stimulus package that cost nearly $190 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That included over $100 billion in new spending and a somewhat smaller amount in tax cuts, about $79 billion in fiscal year 2009. George W. Bush was not in office when those measures passed. So a more accurate number for the deficit he passed on might be closer to $1.2 trillion. But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group concerned by rising deficits, told PunditFact that the budget numbers don’t tell you much. It’s very difficult to untangle responsibility during those years, he said. "In FY2009 you didn’t just have the stimulus," Ellis said. "Many of the fiscal decisions at the end of the Bush presidency were done in consultation with the president-elect, like the Detroit auto bailout. Even with TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) both campaigns were consulted." Ellis is wary of what he calls snapshot comparisons because he doesn’t think they are fair to either the president stepping down or the one taking over. They ignore too much context. Ellis noted that before deficits plummeted under Obama, they remained quite high. The Occupy Democrats post brushed past that fiscal reality. "The debt has increased more under President Obama so far than it did in the entirety of President Bush’s eight years," Ellis said. "I don’t think that’s an accurate measure either, but it tells a different tale." Sinclair, along with Ellis, emphasized a simple fact of budgeting that should be factored in: the role of Congress. "Since Congress is really responsible for the budget, it's always a little strange to blame the president for it," Sinclair said. And Ellis noted that about two-thirds of all spending is mandatory, in the form of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. That said, according to the Congressional Budget Office, policy changes under George W. Bush — including tax cuts, the Iraq War, the Medicare prescription drug benefit and agricultural subsidies — greatly increased deficits. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that George W. Bush "handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit" and Obama reduced Bush’s "deficit to just $492 billion." The post picked certain years to back that up, and for those years, its numbers were accurate. But many factors complicate this simple picture. While it’s true that Bush pushed policies that drove up deficits, the federal response to the Great Recession was to some extent shared by Bush and Obama. In addition, while deficits have fallen under Obama, the claim brushes over that deficits remained above the trillion dollar mark for several years, long after Bush left office. The statement leaves out a lot of important information. We rate it Half True.	None	Occupy Democrats	None	None	None	2015-08-27T12:52:44	2015-04-25	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-02990	Since Obamacare became law, "most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/18/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-most-new-jobs-have-been-part-time-/	Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Obamacare has eroded the quality of jobs in the United States. "Since the president signed it into law, in Virginia and around the country, most of our new jobs have been part-time jobs limited to less than 30 hours a week so employers can avoid the high cost of federally imposed health care bills," Cuccinelli said in a Sept. 19 speech. Cuccinelli has sought to make his opposition of Obamacare and Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe’s support of the law a major issue in the gubernatorial race. Cuccinelli’s statement referred to an Obamacare mandate -- scheduled to take effect in 2015 -- that businesses with more than 50 employees provide health care coverage to those working 30 hours or more a week or pay a fine. Obamacare became law in March 2010. We asked Cuccinelli’s campaign for proof that most of the jobs created since then have been part-time. Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, pointed us to a Sept. 2, 2013 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that said the number of temporary U.S. workers had risen by 2.7 million -- a 50 percent jump -- since the recession ended in June 2009. Those figures, however, don’t verify Cuccinelli’s claim that the majority of new jobs during the last 4-1/2 years have been part time. So we dug deeper. The Bureau of Labor Statistics each month reports the number of people who usually work full time and the number who usually work part time. It defines part-time employees as people who usually work less than 35 hours a week -- an even broader definition of part time than Cuccinelli cited. In March 2010, seasonally adjusted BLS figures show the U.S. had 111.2 million full-time workers. That rose to 116.2 million in August 2013, the latest month for which figures were available when Cuccinelli made his statement. That’s an increase of about 5 million. The number of part-time jobs went from 27.5 million in March 2010 to just under 28 million in August 2013, an increase of about 500,000. So, contrary to Cuccinelli’s claim, full-time jobs have grown 10 times faster than part-time employment since Obamacare was signed into law. Cuccinelli would have been on more solid ground if he had confined his statement to this year. From January through August, there were increases of 290,000 full-time jobs and 532,000 part-time positions. In other words, nearly two out of three new jobs this year have been part time. Many analysts think there’s a connection between Obamacare and the surge in part-time jobs this year, although they also say the sluggish economy has a role in the increase. The employer insurance mandate originally was scheduled to begin next year, causing hundreds of businesses to announce they are hiring only part-time workers or scaling back hours to avoid the cost of providing benefits required by Obamacare. The White House announced in July it would push back the employer mandate to 2015. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco wrote in an Aug. 26 memo that the trend of part-time hiring might slacken now that the insurance requirement has been delayed. The Fed researchers wrote that Obamacare’s impact on part-time employment so far and in the future is "likely to be small." About 19 percent of U.S. jobs are now part time. The researchers said once Obamacare is fully implemented, the proportion of part-time jobs is likely to increase by 1 to 2 percent "or less." Mark Perry, a economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, recently cautioned against giving too much meaning to this year’s part-time employment numbers, writing that the data is "extremely volatile" in the short term and needs to be considered over time. A final note: Cuccinelli claimed that since the signing of Obamacare, most of the new jobs have been part time not only across the nation, but in Virginia as well. We spoke to several analysts while trying to research the state numbers. But there’s no set of monthly numbers that shows the increase in full-time and part-time jobs between the signing of the Affordable Care Act and the time when Cuccinelli made his statement. Our ruling Cuccinelli says that since President Barack Obama signed the health care law, most of the new jobs created in the country have been part time. He’s flat out wrong. BLS figures show that since the signing in March 2010, there are 5 million more full-time workers and 500,000 more part-time employees. Cuccinelli would have been on the putting for par if he’d aimed his statement at the first eight months of this year, when 65 percent of new jobs were part time, although analysts differ on Obamacare’s blame for that trend. But his shot at Obamacare since its inception wound up in the woods. We rate his statement False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-10-18T10:51:26	2013-09-19	['None']

pomt-14590	"I waited until (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) had actually been negotiated" before deciding whether to endorse it.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/05/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-revisionist-history-tpp/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal became an issue during her Feb. 4 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. She says she now opposes it. MSNBC debate moderator Chuck Todd pointed out that Clinton supported the deal while secretary of state, then asked her whether she might support such agreements again if she were elected. Clinton said she had voted against a previous trade deal as a U.S. senator and, regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership, "I said that I was holding out the hope that (TPP) would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for. "I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the (Obama) administration," she said. "Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it." Did Clinton really withhold her support until the terms of the proposal had been finalized? PolitiFact has looked at the issue before. We found Clinton made plenty of strongly supportive comments about the deal while negotiations were still ongoing. Speaking in Australia in 2012, Clinton hailed the deal as "setting the gold standard." "This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field," Clinton said. "And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." Strong words for a deal that hadn't been completed yet. But it wasn’t just on that one occasion that Clinton was more than just hopeful about the deal’s impact. She declared in November 2012 remarks in Singapore that it would "lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. "It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy." As PolitiFact reported in October, she also used words such as "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high-quality" and "high-standard" in describing the partnership before she left the State Department in 2013. The partners finalized the deal in 2015. Why the change of heart? In Thursday’s debate, Clinton said she opposes the trade deal because, "We have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy." Our ruling Clinton said, "I waited until (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) had actually been negotiated" before deciding whether to endorse it. As secretary of state and a member of the Obama administration, it was Clinton's job to promote the deal, even if it wasn't finalized. Nonetheless, her comments at the time were so positive and so definitive, it becomes disingenuous to argue, as she's doing now, that she didn't endorse the deal before it was finalized. We rate her statement Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-05T00:17:11	2016-02-04	['None']

pomt-05353	Says Democratic recall opponent Tom Barrett is campaigning on "lifting property tax" limits.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/11/scott-walker/wisconsin-recall-gov-scott-walker-says-opponent-to/	Reducing property taxes is one accomplishment Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker touts in his bid to remain in office. In April 2012, the Republican governor announced that during his first year in office, the property tax bill for the typical Wisconsin homeowner had gone down -- the first such decrease in 12 years. Meanwhile, as we found in rating a claim by the Republican Governors Association, the Milwaukee property tax levy increased in seven of eight years under Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s opponent in the June 2012 recall election. So it was no surprise that Walker would seek an opportunity to hit Barrett on the issue. On May 7, 2012, a day before Barrett won the Democratic recall nomination, Walker released a TV ad claiming -- among other things -- that taxes would go up if Barrett is elected governor. At one point in the ad, the narrator says "Barrett wants to undo (Walker’s) reforms and raise your taxes to pay for it." As those words are spoken, a more specific message appears on the screen: "Barrett campaigns on lifting property tax ceilings." Walker himself repeated the more specific claim the next day on Milwaukee talk radio, telling host Jay Weber of WISN-AM (1130) that both Barrett and Kathleen Falk, who finished second in the primary, "said they’d lift the caps on property taxes." But hardly anybody likes taxes, right? Is Barrett really "campaigning on" raising them? Let’s start with some background. Walker and the Republican-led Legislature adopted strict property tax caps as part of the 2011-2013 state budget. For counties and municipalities, growth in the levy is limited to the value of new construction. Walker and lawmakers also cut school aid and reduced the overall amount of revenue that schools could raise in state aid and property taxes -- known as the revenue limit -- by 5.5 percent. The result? According to the state Department of Revenue, the total property tax levy in the state rose by just $21 million, or 0.2 percent, in 2011. And property taxes on the median home valued at $157,600 fell about $11, or 0.4 percent, to $2,951 -- the first such drop since 1999. But Walker’s ad focuses on Barrett’s position. Walker’s evidence In accusing Barrett of campaigning to lift the caps, the ad cites a news article on the website of WTAQ, an AM and FM radio station in Green Bay. The article was posted April 17, 2012, the day after Walker announced the property tax reduction. The headline on the article -- "Barrett, Falk campaign on lifting property tax ceilings" -- was almost word for word the message that appeared on the screen in Walker’s ad. But the article itself made an important distinction between Barrett and Falk. Both criticized the property tax limits, but while Falk said she would repeal the limits, Barrett "stopped short of making that promise," the article said. When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews to back Walker’s claim, she argued that even if Barrett didn’t promise to remove the caps, he nevertheless had campaigned to do so. Matthews pointed us to another part of the article, which quoted Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak as saying the caps are "absolute and draconian." Matthews also noted that a longer version of Walzak’s comment appeared in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article the same day the radio station website article was posted. The newspaper, noting that Walzak’s comment was made in a prepared statement, quoted Walzak as saying: "Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian. They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth." That statement shows Barrett is against keeping the current property tax caps in place -- but doesn’t indicate whether Barrett would merely modify the limits or lift them altogether. Matthews didn’t provide any other evidence, and we couldn’t find any other statements Barrett has made in the campaign about property tax caps. Barrett’s response Walzak told us Barrett has not campaigned on lifting the caps, and that the statement he issued criticizing them was in response to a Journal Sentinel reporter’s question. That’s a relevant point, given that Barrett has campaigned repeatedly on a number of issues -- including restoring collective bargaining rights for public employees and "ending the civil war" that he says Walker started. But he hasn’t emphasized property tax caps. Walzak also argued that Walker’s ad wrongly implies Barrett would lift the caps in a way that would lead to widespread property tax increases, leaving no controls. But what Barrett advocates, according to Walzak, is working with local governments to give them flexibility to raise property taxes when more revenue is needed to spur economic growth. Here’s the full statement Walzak issued on the subject: "Unlike the top-down imposition of policy that dictates policy instead of develops it in partnership with local leaders, Tom as governor will work with local governments and officials to determine what they need to make local investments to attract retain and create jobs on the local level. Of course controlling tax increases will be a priority. But Walker's caps are absolute and draconian. They don't account for inflation adjustments, or allow adjustments for real economic growth. These inflexible, rigid caps can actually stifle opportunities for local growth, because they can have a negative impact in investing in business parks and transportation infrastructure that are so often key to making investments that encourage business expansion or make local areas more attractive to businesses considering relocation from other states." The complete statement makes it clear that Barrett wants to change the current property tax caps. But the fact that no other Barrett statements on the caps could be found indicates he has not been campaigning on the issue. And he has not articulated to what degree he would change the caps. Our rating In a TV ad, Walker claimed that Barrett is campaigning "on lifting property tax ceilings." It was part of a more sweeping claim that taxes overall would go up with Barrett as governor. Barrett issued a statement during the campaign making it clear he wants to change the caps, so in that sense he would "lift" them. But he has not campaigned on the issue, nor spelled out how much he would modify the current limits. Walker’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-08003	"A record number of Hispanics were elected to the U.S House of Representatives..."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/13/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-record-number-hispanics-elected-us-h/	The 2010 midterm elections saw the rise of the Tea Party, the resurgence of the Republican Party in Congress, and a number of Hispanic candidates elected to prominent positions. There was Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American elected to the United States Senate; Brian Sandoval, the first Hispanic governor of Nevada; and Susana Martinez of New Mexico, the first Hispanic woman in the country to be elected as governor. The successes of Hispanic candidates in the midterm elections is a point noted by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in an opinion article he penned for The Miami Herald on Jan. 9, 2011. In the article, Bush, a Republican, warns that conservatives "get unacceptably low support among Hispanic voters nationally" and urges the "center-right movement … to engage the Hispanic community." "The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates in this past election is a clear sign that now is the time to recommit to a serious outreach effort," Bush writes. "Among these newly-elected Hispanic leaders, there were many notable records and firsts. Marco Rubio was overwhelmingly elected to the U.S. Senate despite starting his campaign as a heavy underdog to more-seasoned candidates. A record number of Hispanics were elected to the U.S House of Representatives, including Republicans Raúl Labrador of Idaho, David Rivera of Florida, Bill Flores and Francisco Canseco from Texas, and Jaime Herrera of Washington." He wrote the piece in advance of the Hispanic Leadership Network Conference, which he helped organize. The conference, scheduled for Jan. 13 and 14, 2011, in Coral Gables, is aimed at engaging "members of the Hispanic community on center-right principles." We decided to check the accuracy of Bush’s claim that a record number of Hispanics had been elected to the U.S. House this past election. First, we turned to Bush for clarification. His press secretary, Jaryn Emhoff, said Bush's references to "center-right" was intended to refer to Hispanic Republicans. "An earlier sentence sets the stage when it says, ‘The unprecedented success of Hispanic center-right candidates…’," Emhoff explained. To check the validity of Bush’s claim, we turned to the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO), which keeps track of the progress made by Hispanic-Latino candidates from the local to the national level. "There was a record number of Hispanic Republicans elected, but not a record number of Hispanics in general," said Patricia Guadalupe, spokesperson for the NALEO Educational Fund. "There were two Latinos who lost their seats to non-Latinos, and in other seats you had one Latino replacing another," Guadalupe said. There are currently 24 Hispanic members of the U.S. House, which matches the record set in 2009 by the incoming class of the 111th Congress. However, the most notable shift between the two classes is the gain made by Republicans. In 2009, there were 21 Democrats and three Republicans; now, those figures now stand at 17 Democrats and seven Republicans. During the November 2010 elections, the seven Hispanic Republicans elected to the U.S House were: • Bill Flores, Texas -- Flores, a political newcomer was able to defeat longtime Rep. Chet Edwards, a Democrat. Flores’ win made him the first Republican Latino to represent Texas’s 17th congressional district. • Francisco Canseco, Texas -- Canseco, a businessman, defeated Democratic Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, (also Hispanic), for the state’s District 23 congressional seat. • Jaime Herrera, Washington -- Herrera became the first Hispanic to represent the state in Congress by defeating businessman Danny Heck. • Raul Labrador, Idaho -- By defeating Democratic incumbent Walter Minnick, Labrador became the state’s first Latino congressman. • David Rivera, Florida -- Rivera won against Democratic challenger Joe Garcia for the Florida District 25 seat vacated by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. • Mario Diaz-Balart, Florida -- Already a congressman representing District 25, Diaz-Balart opted to run for the District 21 seat being vacated by his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart. • Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Florida -- The country’s first Hispanic woman elected to Congress retained her seat in a heavily Hispanic and Republican district after running against a lesser-known Democratic candidate, Rolando A. Banciella. For a complete list of all the Hispanic members of the House elected in 2010, click here. The number of Hispanics in Congress has been rising steadily. Consider that in 1998, there were 18 Hispanic members in the House and no senators. Fast forward to 2011: There are 24 Hispanics in the House and two Cuban-American senators, Rubio and Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. Although the number of Hispanics in the House is the same now as it was after the 2008 election, Bush is correct in recognizing the growth in the past decade. However, he would have been more precise if he’d said that a record number of Hispanic Republicans were elected to the U.S. House, rather than leaving it to the reader’s assumption that he was referring to the GOP. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2011-01-13T18:22:52	2011-01-09	['None']

pomt-10801	"I have not changed my position on the (gay) marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/05/mitt-romney/consistent-on-gay-marriage-not-on-amendment/	In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, "I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage that ...you know, I think the New York Times said that I had changed my tone." Here's a look at his comments over the years: In 1994, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, he told a Boston-area gay newspaper that the definition of marriage was a "state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction." During his Senate race, Romney wrote in a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, "I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent." He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military. But even in 1994, he clearly opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, telling the Bay Windows newspaper that he backed the current governor's position that the law should only uphold male-female marriages. In 2002, when Romney was governor, his wife, son and daughter-in-law signed a petition supporting a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts constitution, that would not only ban the state from recognizing same-sex marriages, but further stated, "Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage or its legal equivalent, nor shall it receive the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage." But Romney quickly expressed his opposition to the amendment, saying that although he believed marriage was between a man and a woman, the language barring civil unions was "too extreme," with his spokesman telling the Boston Globe, "Mitt does not support it. As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary." Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed. And so we give Romney a Half-True. He is correct that he has been consistent in his opposition to same-sex marriage, but has changed his position as to the scope of an amendment that he would support.

pomt-11027	"Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/03/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-falsely-claims-sen-tim-kaine-wants-d/	Corey Stewart, the Republican vying to unseat incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, blasted Kaine and other Democrats for their immigration views during a live video broadcast to his Facebook page on June 30, 2018. "The left is calling for — Tim Kaine and the Democrats are calling for — not only no border enforcement; they don’t want a border at all," Stewart said. "Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well. He wants to get rid of all that." The video showed Stewart driving in his car to a protest at the Red Hen, the restaurant in Lexington, Va., that sparked controversy when its owner asked White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to get up from her table and leave. Stewart was joined at the protest by campaign supporters, including a local "Bikers for Trump" group. His comments followed some Democratic calls to abolish ICE, the U.S. government agency best known for arresting, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com After progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., with a campaign that called for ICE’s elimination, several Democratic leaders — including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren — adopted similar positions. But we found no evidence that Kaine hopped on that bandwagon, despite Stewart’s claim. Noel Fritsch, spokesman for the Stewart campaign, did not respond to a request for comment. Kaine has been relatively firm in his support for bills that add to border security, while at the same time advocating for legal immigration, protection of Dreamers — immigrants here illegally who arrived as children — and other traditionally Democratic immigration policies. Kaine has also been critical of Trump’s policy of separating immigrant families at the border. With regard to ICE, Kaine has rebuked controversial raiding tactics practiced under the Trump administration, but he has not called for the agency’s termination. "Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security," said a statement on the immigration page of Kaine’s campaign website. The 2013 bill, for which Kaine delivered a Senate floor speech in Spanish, was the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, and it passed the Senate by a 68-32 vote. Although it ultimately died in the House, the bill would have increased the number of federal agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, required construction of 700 miles of border fencing and allocated money for aerial drones, among other border security measures. The bill also included provisions that would have allowed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to adjust their immigration status so long as they satisfied certain criteria. Later, in February 2018, Kaine co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers and enhance border security. In addition to providing legal status and a path to citizenship for people who arrived in the U.S. as children, the bill would have granted $25 billion in funding for Northern and Southern border security over a 10-year period. "We’ve reached a deal that gives us the best chance to protect Dreamers against deportation from the only country they know as home," Kaine said at the time. Ultimately, the proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate after the Trump administration publicly opposed it. "I think we do need to do more border control," Kaine said during an interview on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" in April 2018. "I want to see a strategy … not just a president acting like the military was his palace guard and he could do whatever he wanted on a day in question." Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to the 2013 and 2018 bills as well as an op-ed Kaine wrote criticizing the Trump policy of separating families at the border. Sams also noted that the $25 billion in border security funds provided by the 2018 proposal was the exact amount Trump had requested. Our Ruling Stewart said, "Tim Kaine doesn’t want a border at all. He wants to get rid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and basically the border patrol as well." We found no evidence to support this claim. On the contrary, Kaine has backed two comprehensive immigration bills that featured significant measures for increased border security. He has not made any statements about getting rid of ICE, let alone the border. We rate Stewart’s statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-01644	The Obama administration originally "wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/24/martha-raddatz/obama-wanted-keep-10000-troops-iraq-abcs-raddatz-c/	Sunday show pundits weighed provocations by the Islamic State this week after the public beheading of American journalist James Foley, with some military analysts arguing for a stronger military response from President Barack Obama. On ABC This Week, retired Marine Gen. John Allen said ending the threat from the Islamic State will require a coalition approach that targets the extreme militant groups across the larger region of Iraq and Syria. Martha Raddatz, ABC’s chief global affairs correspondent, was wearing her TV pundit hat when she said Allen’s idea for a strategy "makes me think back about what the Obama administration originally wanted." "They wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort," she said. "So perhaps they'd go that way, but it would be a tough one." The number sounded interesting to PunditFact given Obama’s 2008 campaign pledge to pull out of Iraq entirely (which PolitiFact monitors here) and his repeated 2012 campaign proclamations that the war was over. So we decided to check it out. The plan Shortly before Obama took office in January 2009, his predecessor, George W. Bush, finalized an important agreement after about a year of negotiations with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Called the Status of Forces Agreement, it spelled out the withdrawal of all American troops by the end of 2011. Obama, who won office in 2008 partly for his pledge to end the war in Iraq, announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. "Let me say this as plainly as I can: by Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he said Feb. 27, 2009. His speech revealed more details: He would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. What would happen after Jan. 1, 2012, -- a central point in our fact-check -- was not settled until the fall of 2011. Obama and the Iraqi government had been open to leaving more troops behind to help the country remain stable. But it didn’t happen. The result On Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel. Essentially, he implemented the phase-out plan laid out by Bush. Facing a re-election challenge, Obama held the drawdown of all troops as the fulfillment of a campaign pledge. He did not harp on what some, namely Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, would see as a failure: failure to reach an agreement regarding how many American troops would remain in the country beyond Jan. 1, 2012. This was something Obama and his defense advisers had pushed for as they wrangled in negotiations with the al-Maliki-led government in the summer of 2011. The administration feared a virtually complete pullout would allow for big attacks from militant groups. Here’s what they wanted, and why it failed. Behind the numbers Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. The Obama administration was initially open to leaving up to 10,000 troops in Iraq after the scheduled pullout at the end of 2011, a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement, the Los Angeles Times reported. The troops were to be placed in Baghdad and other "strategic" locations around the country. It did not stay there. The New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. Obama ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, according to the New York Times, and "the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s." What killed the deal The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force. But no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence. "When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible," al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. "The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started." Three years later, as the Islamic State advanced in the country and shocked the world, a CNN reporter asked Obama if he regretted the decision not to leave a residual force in Iraq. Obama said, "Keep in mind, that wasn't a decision made by me. That was a decision made by the Iraqi government." The political overtones have ratcheted up with international headlines about Islamic State, which also is called ISIS. Conservatives blame Obama for pulling out too soon, for leaving Iraq vulnerable, and liberals argue the pullout deadline was prescribed by Bush. "You pick your poison there," said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University’s Department of History and Government. "It’s fair to say no one saw this ISIS stuff coming." An ABC spokesman said Raddatz was unavailable for comment. The White House did not respond to emails. Our ruling Raddatz said the Obama administration originally "wanted 10,000 troops to remain in Iraq -- not combat troops, but military advisers, special operations forces, to watch the counterterrorism effort." For a period, at least, the Obama administration did envision leaving 10,000 troops in Iraq past the Dec. 31, 2011, pullout of forces. That number went down to about 5,000 before negotiations stalled amid a legal snare over immunity of American forces in Iraqi courts. Her claim is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-13835	Says "220,000 New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/13/bill-de-blasio/less-immigrants-affects-supreme-court-ruling-nyc-d/	After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive actions on immigration reform, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio held an impromptu press conference at New York City Hall. During his remarks, he offered an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in New York City who would be affected by the court’s ruling. "Two hundred twenty-thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed," De Blasio said. "So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court." De Blasio claimed that the Supreme Court’s ruling would damage the lives of 220,000 people in New York City. So did the Supreme Court ruling mean that many people lost their chance to legally remain in the country? DAPA and DACA Checking the accuracy of the mayor’s assertion requires accounting for the number of people affected by three actions by the Obama administration. First, the administration started the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, in 2012. DACA allows people who came to the United States before their 16th birthday to legally remain in the country for at least two years. After the two years, they can apply for renewal. To qualify for the program, immigrants could not be older than 31 in 2012. Immigrants also had to have a relatively clean criminal record and be on track to finish high school or already graduated. The Migration Policy Institute estimated 53,000 people in New York City eligible to legally remain in the country under the 2012 DACA program, slightly more than an estimate of 48,935 by the Center for Migration Studies Second, in 2014, Obama expanded the DACA program. The age limit was lifted under the expansion. Some 15,701 people were eligible for the 2014 DACA extension, according to the Center for Migration Studies. Third, Obama also created the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, in 2014. The new program allowed parents of U.S. citizens to legally stay in the country for at least three years, after which they would be eligible for renewal. The center said its research shows an estimated 143,064 immigrants eligible for DAPA in New York City. According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 627,000 unauthorized immigrants living in the five counties that make up New York City. Of those, 230,000 would have been eligible to legally remain in the country under either DAPA or DACA following the president’s 2014 actions, according to the institute. In 2014, many Republicans criticized DACA but weren’t able to reverse Obama’s action. But the expansion of DACA and creation of DAPA led to a legal storm between the state of Texas and the Obama administration. Texas argued that the president’s 2014 actions violated the Constitution. The Supreme Court sided with Texas. The decision struck down DAPA and the 2014 DACA expansion but left the original DACA program in place. So how many would be affected in New York City? When counting the number of people affected by the Supreme Court ruling, those eligible to legally remain in the country only because of the DAPA program or the 2014 expansion of DACA should be counted. That comes to just under 160,000 affected people, according to the Center for Migration Studies. The Migration Policy Institute pegs it slightly higher at 180,000 immigrants. Those who were eligible for the original 2012 DACA program are still eligible to apply and be granted deferred action despite the court ruling. A few groups track the number of people who were eligible under the 2014 actions, including the Migration Policy Institute. It is one of the few that have data available specifically for counties with high populations of unauthorized immigrants. That’s important because Mayor de Blasio was only referring to numbers in New York City. Its data is the latest from the U.S. Census Bureau. The mayor’s office says it also used data from the bureau to come up with its number. The bureau does not directly ask people if they are authorized to live in the U.S. legally. Michelle Mittelstadt from the Migration Policy Institute says the institute considers the population and demographics of an area to come up with a final number, and it’s among the few that does so on a local level. "The Census Bureau does not ask people their legal status with respect to being unauthorized," Mittelstadt said. "That leaves it to a small number of organizations who have developed methodology to essentially try to look at who among the foreign-born population is unauthorized." Our ruling At a press conference on June 23, Mayor de Blasio said, "Two hundred twenty thousand New Yorkers would have immediately benefitted had President Obama’s executive action been affirmed. So almost a quarter million of our fellow New Yorkers who are hurting right now whose rights and opportunities were taken away by the Supreme Court." Based on the latest data, released in 2014, the mayor overestimated the number of unauthorized immigrants the Supreme Court ruling affected. His office says the city’s Center for Economic Opportunity used its own methodology in conjunction with data from the Census Bureau to develop its estimate, but a 40,000-person difference reaches beyond a margin of error.

pomt-15316	"Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/blog-posting/did-vermont-pastor-get-sentenced-prison-refusing-m/	Perhaps you have seen in your social media feeds an article headlined, "Christian Pastor in Vermont Sentenced to One Year in Prison After Refusing to Marry Gay Couple." It received about 5,000 Facebook shares as well as interactions on other social media platforms. Is it real? We decided to take a closer look. The article was published at a site called NewsExaminer on July 10. It says that a pastor from Proctor, Vt., was sentenced to a year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. It came just days after the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that same-sex marriage would be allowed in all 50 states. (The ruling didn’t legalize same-sex marriage in Vermont, which approved it on its own in 2009.) But the bottom line is that the NewsExaminer is a fake-news site, and has been classified as such by Snopes, the urban legends site. Through a posting to an NBC copycat website with the url www.nbc.com.co, the article gained traction through mistaken association with the genuine NBC News site. The article cites several individuals involved in the case, but none seem to exist. The Christian pastor who was sentenced, Paul Horner, is actually a recurring name used in stories published by the National Report and other fake news sites. According to Snopes.com, the character Paul Horner has been used in past articles about everything from the British street artist Banksy to a Dolphin mascot for a Christian organization. (We’ve previously run into the Zelig-like Horner in such articles as this one and this one.) The Hon. Myron Danus, the judge who supposedly made the ruling, is also fictitious. We checked the Vermont Court Administration Office in Montpelier, the U.S. District Court in Rutland County, and the Rutland County District Court to check if there is any judge by that name in the state, and there isn’t. Though the LGBT Pride Center referenced in the article is real -- or at least there is an organization with a similar name -- Gwen Hawkins, the supposed president of the organization, does not exist. Instead, the Pride Center of Vermont lists Kim Fountain as its executive director. We also couldn’t find a record for the Vermont Family Research Committee or its purported president, Steve Shand. There is one element of the article that is accurate: The town of Proctor exists. It is a small town in Rutland County, Vt.,with a population of just under 2,000. It is, as the article accurately says, "home to the Vermont Marble Museum, and the only marble bridge in America." However, the Christian Proctor Church is as fake as its pastor. According to the Proctor Town Offices, the town has only three churches: St. Dominic’s, Union, and St. Paul’s. Our ruling Posts about a Christian pastor in Vermont being sentenced to one year in prison after refusing to marry a gay couple have circulated on the Internet. However, the article was published at a known fake-news site, and we found no evidence to support the existence of key elements of the story, including the pastor, church, or the judge referenced in the article. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-07-16T16:58:10	2015-07-10	['None']
pomt-14472	"There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/01/barack-obama/obama-none-gop-candidates-have-climate-change-plan/	Foreign leaders are "troubled" by some of the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential primary, and it’s not just what they’re hearing from Donald Trump, says President Barack Obama. "But this is not just Mr. Trump. Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates," Obama said at a Feb. 16 news conference. "There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it’s serious. Well, that's a problem. The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be?" Obama’s statement sounded similar to a take from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently said, "Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real." We rated that claim False because a couple GOP presidential candidates (including some who are no longer in the running) have acknowledged its existence. Obama’s claim is different: He said none of the Republicans thinks the country should do anything about climate change. To different degrees, the remaining candidates don’t believe man-made climate change is happening, or at least not to the extent that Obama and a vast majority of climate scientists believe it’s happening. All of the Republican candidates — Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson — call for scaling back environmental and energy regulations. Some support going through the private sector for renewable energy source development, alongside continued development of fossil fuels, and environmental protection. But none have a fleshed-out plan to specifically address the issue of climate change. Here’s where the remaining Republican presidential candidates stand on climate change and what they propose to do (or not do) about it. Donald Trump Trump has said repeatedly that he does not believe in climate change, even suggesting it’s a conspiracy invented by China to make the United States less competitive. His website doesn’t have any information on his plans to combat climate change or how he would approach energy issues. He has said he would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, and the environment will be "fine." When MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump in November what he would do about climate change, Trump did not outline a specific plan, but he said, "We want to have clean air to breathe and we want to have beautiful clean water. That's very important to me." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio believes the climate is changing, but he questions how much of it is man-made. "The climate has always changed," Rubio said in January. "There’s never been a time when the climate has not been changing." He has criticized international climate efforts, as well as Obama’s regulatory measures, saying they are more damaging to the economy than they are helpful to the environment. "If you’re overly dependent on any one source of fuel, then you become vulnerable to disruption," he said at the same event in January. "I want America to truly have a truly all-of-the-above strategy." Rubio has not released a plan to quell the effects of climate change. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas Cruz believes man-made climate change is not real. He has called it a "pseudoscientific theory" and has criticized Obama for calling it a major security threat. His website says he would abolish the Energy Department and eliminate at least 10 existing climate change and environmental programs. Like Rubio, he calls for an "all-of-the-above" approach to energy, meaning he supports development of fossil fuels as well as renewable resources, which he says amounts to an "energy renaissance." "We must harness our nation’s energy resources and remove federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade," he wrote. Ben Carson Carson does not believe in man-made climate change. He has said it’s part of a natural cycle and cannot be "an excuse not to develop our own God-given natural resources." His energy plan calls for reducing government regulations on energy production, including fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, but also developing renewable fuels. He also calls on people to be stewards of the environment, but not at the expense of jobs and the economy. He did tell Time in October 2015 that if there is "clear-cut evidence" that a certain manufacturing practice is causing significant harm to the environment, President Carson might take some action. "I would use the EPA to work with business industry and academia to find the cleanest, most environmentally friendly way to do things, rather than just all right, we’re coming in here and we’re shutting you down," he said. Ohio Gov. John Kasich As recently as Feb. 29, Kasich has said he believes there is a climate change problem, acknowledging he is going against the grain of his party. But he has not proposed a full-fledged strategy to address it, and his fact sheet on energy does not mention climate change. He has, though called for pursuing renewable energy sources as one possible response. In August, he questioned the extent of man’s impact on the environment, calling full-blown climate change "some theory that is not proven." He said he wouldn’t want to destroy any jobs in order to address these concerns. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Bush has dropped out of the race, but we’re including him because he was still in the running when Obama made his statement. He believes climate change is real and human activity is a contributing factor. He had an energy plan but not a specific environmental protection plan. He has argued that some of the Obama administration’s regulations go too far, such as Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Like most of the other Republican candidates, he called for reducing regulations and increasing growth in the energy sector, both fossil fuel and renewable sources. "Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment," his energy plan said. "Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary." Our ruling Obama said, "There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change." None of the remaining Republican presidential candidates have laid out a specific plan to address climate change. All of them call for scaling back Obama’s environmental regulations, to boot. Some have called for private-sector development of renewable energy sources. Bush, who was in the race when Obama made his comment, and Kasich both have said they believe human-caused climate change is real and have said pursuing these alternative energy sources could mitigate the problem. But neither has outlined a specific plan. For some Republican voters, this stance might be a plus. But it doesn’t change the veracity of Obama’s statement. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07175	"When I became president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, it was supposed to go bankrupt . . . We turned it around with common-sense business principles."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/10/herman-cain/herman-cain-godfathers-pizza-turn-around/	Editor's note: This fact-check is a excerpt of a longer examination of Herman Cain's business accomplishments, including his work experience before and after Godfather's Pizza. Read the longer story here. Pizza is Herman Cain's biggest selling point. He says his track record running Godfather’s Pizza, a chain that once billed itself as "the cure for the pizza emergency," shows he has the ability to run the country. The 620-store chain was on the brink of bankruptcy when he arrived in 1986, he says, and he "turned it around with common-sense business principles." A PolitiFact examination of Godfather’s, based on interviews with industry analysts and company officials, shows Cain is largely correct. The chain wasn’t literally preparing paperwork for bankruptcy, but it was widely considered troubled. Cain changed that by uniting the franchisees, overhauling the chain's advertising, and getting his team focused on its core mission: pizza. 'They got what they paid for' Cain was an executive with The Pillsbury Co. when the company bought Godfather's in 1985. The purchase was almost incidental, according to press reports from the time. Godfather’s was part of Diversifoods Inc., a conglomerate that included more than 300 Burger King franchises. Pillsbury wanted the Burger Kings, and the chain of more than 800 Godfather’s pizza restaurants came with it. "The value of Diversifoods was its ownership of the Burger Kings, and the deal made sense without Godfather's," John McMillin, an industry analyst, told the Chicago Tribune shortly after the deal. "Pillsbury got Godfather's for nothing, and some said they got what they paid for." The chain’s problems included franchisee lawsuits, an overly long menu and a dejected workforce. Even its TV ads seemed hapless, showing a car full of executives driving around, unable to find a Godfather's. ("Find one. It's worth it," the ad lamely concluded.) As Cain said later, the chain had "had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel." Cain attacked problems on every front. He declared the company’s advertising account up for review, pitting ad agencies against each other in a bidding war. He trimmed the menu and enforced quality standards. He pushed more restaurants to offer delivery, and he closed low-performing franchises. He emphasized communication, giving speeches at important moments to employees and franchisees. After his first 60 days at Godfather's, he gave a speech he called "get on the wagon," which he now uses in political speeches. When he was a boy, Cain said, his grandfather, a potato farmer, would hitch up his mules for the weekly trip to town. Any grandchildren who wanted to go could ride along. Cain would finish the story in his grandfather’s thundering voice: "Them that’s going, get on the wagon! Them that ain’t, get out of the way!" 'Mesmerizing' Charles Henderson, who runs coffee kiosks in Pennsylvania, was Cain’s director of marketing back then. He says Cain is "probably the most inspirational person I’ve ever met in my life." "He can be mesmerizing. He’s very dynamic. I’m not slamming our current president, but Herman Cain will give a 20- or 30-minute speech extemporaneously, and certainly without teleprompters. He is without a doubt the most dynamic speaker I’ve ever heard," Henderson said. Henderson said Cain succeeded because he immersed himself in all aspects of the business and wasn’t afraid to get his hands into the dough. Cain baked pies on a weekly basis after he arrived in Omaha. "He loved to make pizzas. We had a test store over on Pacific Street, which wasn’t too far from Godfather’s, and once a week, he’d round us all up and we’d go make pizzas," Henderson said. Cain directed an overhaul of the Godfather's television ads that focused on Godfather's "hot slice," a customized pizza slice aimed at the lunch crowd and intended to compete with Pizza Hut's Personal Pan Pizza. The new ads showed a secretary at a desk about to have a "pizza emergency." Godfather's, of course, was the cure. Later commercials tended toward attention-getting and even bizarre humor. The "Studney twins" – an old white guy and a young black guy in garish blue and green tuxedos – promoted Godfather's two-for-one specials. Another ad featured attorney-turned-actor Ben Stein of Ferris Bueller's Day Off as a burned-out hipster needing pizza. Cain himself even appeared in a series that Advertising Age named one of the best campaigns of 1989. In one ad, Cain told viewers Godfather's has conducted exhaustive research to find out why customers preferred Godfather's pizza. He introduced his director of research, who unveiled the results by unfolding a piece of paper and reading two words: "More topping." "Enjoy your Godfather's pizza, and take life one bite at a time," Cain concluded. 'Steady the course' Jeff Campbell is the retired Pillsbury executive who selected Cain to run Godfather’s. Reached by PolitiFact at his home in San Diego, he said there was no doubt in his mind that Cain turned Godfather's around. "He was the best thing that happened to Godfather’s in a long time," Campbell said. Cain has said that the chain returned to profitability within 14 months of his arrival. That number wasn’t possible for PolitiFact to independently confirm because the chain did not report its profits as a stand-alone unit, but industry analysts do not dispute that Cain stabilized the company. Technomic, a research and consulting firm focused on the restaurant industry, has research data on Godfather’s going back to the 1970s. At PolitiFact’s request, vice president Darren Tristano examined the revenues and franchise numbers for Godfather’s during the time Cain headed it from 1986 to 1995. It's not possible to determine profitability from those numbers, but they do show Godfather's place in the market, particularly in comparison with its competitors. "It’s really hard from that period to find a strong positive or a strong negative. It’s more like ‘steady the course,’ " Tristano said. Still, "steady the course" isn’t bad for a company that was troubled to start out with and in an industry that’s punishingly competitive, analysts said. Godfather’s position was particularly perilous. It wasn’t as big as chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, and it also had to compete with locally owned mom-and-pops in just about every market. "They had to be very innovative to compete with the big three and with the little guys. They couldn’t rest on their laurels," said John Correll, a Michigan-based pizza industry consultant. "For a number of years, Herman Cain and his management team were able to pull that off." Pizza Hut, the industry leader at the time, was a particularly difficult foe. After Godfather's launched its "pizza emergency" campaign in 1986, Pizza Hut matched it with ads imitating the emergency broadcast system. In the event of a real pizza emergency, "you should go directly to Pizza Hut and order their famous pan pizza," the ad said. Pizza Hut executives said the similarity was coincidence. Cain said the alleged thievery wouldn’t matter in the end, and he wouldn’t pursue legal action. "It's not a big deal to us," Cain told AdWeek, which documented the feud. Godfather’s never grew fast enough to outpace giants like Pizza Hut and Domino’s, but today it still claims about 620 franchises across the country. John Chisholm was a Godfather's franchisee who owned 90 restaurants in five states when Cain arrived to run the company. "His leadership and his ability to deal with people were just outstanding. I have nothing but the highest praise for Herman Cain," Chisholm said. Cain's primary accomplishment was motivating the people who worked for Godfather's, Chisolm said. The turn-around happened "mostly through motivation and talking to people and getting people to work as a team." Chisholm recalled Cain's first speech to the entire company as one of the "most charismatic" he ever heard. Cain included a copy of the speech in his 1999 book, Speak as a Leader. "Sixty days ago I came to Godfather's with a curiosity about what I would find. I had already accepted my newly bestowed responsibilities even before I stepped foot on Nebraska soil and before I met or knew anyone or anything about Godfather's. … Sixty days ago, I came to Godfather's anxious to tackle a situation considered by some of our external constituencies to be irreversible. I came without a golden parachute because I never entertained the idea that the situation was irreversible. I came committed to prove the skeptics wrong because I have a personal, fundamental belief in the power of human determination. I came to Godfather's believing in you even before I met you. I challenge you to commit and believe in yourself and Godfather's pizza as a system." Two years after Cain was named chief executive officer, Pillsbury decided to get out of the pizza business and sell Godfather’s. Cain and his management team decided to buy the chain in a leveraged buyout for an undisclosed sum. Cain left the position in 1996 when he went to work for the National Restaurant Association. Cain now says of his time at the pizza chain, "When I became president and CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, it was supposed to go bankrupt . . . We turned it around with common sense business principles." Our ruling A thorough review of business records and interviews with executives who worked with Cain show that the chain was widely considered troubled when he arrived. It's a slight exaggeration to say it was supposed to go bankrupt. But from all accounts, Cain's performance as CEO is widely considered a success. So we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-11613	Says Texas schools are ranked "43rd in the nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/25/andrew-white/andrew-white-texas-ranks-43rd-nation-schools-not-s/	Andrew White, the Houston investor among Democratic aspirants hoping to deny Greg Abbott a second term as governor, says the state’s public schools rank poorly. White specified at his December 2017 campaign kickoff: "For schools, we’re 43rd in the nation. Let me say that again. We’re 43rd in the nation. How can we claim that we’re preparing our kids for tomorrow when we can barely prepare them for yesterday?" It’s not unusual for a candidate to suggest schools need a lift. For instance, Abbott, a Republican, promised on his way to winning the state’s top elected post to make Texas "No. 1 in the nation for educating our children." It’s also worth noting there are varied ways of comparing schools. For instance, US News rankings, drawing in part on student scores on national math and reading exams, place Texas’ public schools 41st--though the state's high school graduation rate ranked fifth. So White, who continued to cite the state’s No. 43 ranking into 2018, made us wonder. White spokeswoman Desi Canela, asked how White reached the declared ranking, pointed out news accounts quoting a study released toward the end of 2015 by Education Week, a national publication that reports on education from kindergarten through high school. The stories, posted in January 2016 by Houston Public Media, the San Antonio Express-News and the El Paso Times, each headlined the No. 43 ranking bestowed based on dozens of indicators across the categories of school funding, student achievement and future student success. A correction and more recent rankings When we turned to verify the No. 43 ranking, we learned that the cited study was amended a few weeks after publication to correct errors in its initial school finance section. As a result, Texas schools edged up to rank 41st among the states (42nd if you count the District of Columbia). Also, we noticed, more recent Education Week studies, released in December 2016 and January 2018, respectively, show Texas schools ranking 40th among the states (41st if you count D.C.). To our inquiry, Sterling Lloyd of the Education Week Research Center summed up by email: "In the 2016 report, Texas received an overall grade of C-minus and a score of 69.7. In 2017, it earned a C-minus (70.2). For the 2018 grading, it got a C-minus (70.6). "So, the slight improvement in ranking between 2016 and the subsequent years reflects a modest gain in the state’s numerical score if not its letter grade. This change was driven by an improvement in Texas’ School Finance score, where it gained about a point between 2016 and 2017 and about a point between 2017 and 2018. The improvement for Texas in the School Finance score reflects gains on equity in the distribution of funding across districts within the state. For instance, the gap between the highest- and lowest-spending districts in Texas narrowed from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018." Why Texas placed 40th White couldn’t have had the latest rankings when he announced his candidacy. So to learn more about Texas’ ranking, we focused on the second-to-latest breakdown. The publication’s web page presenting those state-by-state rankings, dated Dec. 30, 2016, shows Texas’s C-minus score of 70.2 trailing both No. 1 Massachusetts, with a B-grade score of 86.5, and the national C-grade average of 74.2. States with worse-than-Texas rankings included California, New Mexico, Oklahoma and, in last place, Nevada with a D-grade score of 65, the page shows. Texas got its C-minus based on the following Education Week-bestowed grades: SOURCE: Web page, "Quality Counts 2017: State Report Cards Map," Education Week, Dec. 30, 2016 A separate web post elaborates on how Texas fared, specifying that the state ranked 24th among the states and D.C. for its "K-12 Achievement Index," which takes into account 18 indicators; 39th in the "Chance-for-Success" category, which considers 13 indicators; and 44th for "School Finance." Other takes We looked next for perspective outside of Education Week. Houston Public Media’s story quoted the Texas Education Agency saying: "It’s difficult to effectively evaluate the state’s performance from a national report where no state made the highest" possible "grade, no state made the lowest grade and the majority of states were all lumped into the same grade category." When we followed up, the agency’s Lauren Callahan reaffirmed the quoted statement and also said by email that the agency doesn’t comment on rankings "since each utilizes a different methodology in determining a final grade." Callahan noted too that the agency has been assigned by law to implement a system giving A-to-F grades to campuses and districts. "Specifics of that system will be in place later this year," Callahan said. We also asked Children At Risk, a Houston-based nonprofit that appraises schools, what it makes of White’s cited rankings. Andy Canales replied by email that the group, which has worked with Education Week, considers the publication’s reports ranking the schools in each state to be sound studies "in line with research by Children At Risk." Holly Eaton of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, which was among education advocacy groups that we asked to weigh in, pointed out that Texas spends less per student than many states. Generally, Eaton said by email, rankings can oversimplify. Notably, she said, the Education Week studies don’t adjust test results that figure into its grades to account for demographic differences. Once that’s done on results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Eaton noted, Texas surges close to having the nation’s best student performance results, according to research by the Urban Institute focused on 2013 and 2015 NAEP scores. By email, Lloyd agreed that it’s important to consider demographics when thinking about a state’s academic performance. But Education Week, he said, tries "to make our methodology for the grading as straightforward as possible. Adjusting for demographics can make the grading less straightforward for the public. It adds methodological details that need to be evaluated." Eaton later commented that Land’s response "illustrates the classic tension in performance reporting between the desire for clarity (thus oversimplification) vs accuracy (thus complexity)." We shared with Canela the fact that Texas schools lately rank 40th in the rankings and didn’t draw additional comment. Our ruling White has said Texas schools rank "43rd in the nation." In fact, Texas schools ranked 40th among the states heading into 2017, according to the latest Education Week rankings that were public before White spoke. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13242	"Sen. (Richard) Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/18/deborah-ross/nc-senate-race-democrat-deborah-ross-ad-against-go/	In a recent campaign ad, North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. "Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act," a narrator says in the ad, while the text, "Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act," appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Here’s a screenshot from the ad: Is Ross’ ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a reauthorization bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed in 2011. Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was passed by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didn’t become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by voice vote. Individual House members’ votes aren’t recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would "allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians," the New York Times reported at the time. These provisions were anathema to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on April 26, 2012, Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr voted for a failed Republican-sponsored amendment that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only comment he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. It’s worth noting that Politico reported on March 14, 2012, that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a "political weapon." "Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a ‘war against women,’ " the Politico story said. "It’s fodder for a campaign ad, and it’s not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days." With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a 34-65 margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on Feb. 12, 2013, the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce the Child Protection Compact Act, which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision "seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating ‘Child Protection Compacts’ between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking," Burr’s Senate website says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an all-time high. So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burr’s actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think it’s relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Ross’ ad said Burr "voted no on the Violence Against Women Act." Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law’s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the ad ignores that three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law.

pomt-09477	The health care bill "dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/01/lamar-alexander/health-care-reform-expand-Medicaid-doctors/	Little known fact: The health care bill will open up Medicaid to millions of Americans. The expansion has been overshadowed by debate over the public option, taxes on "Cadillac" health care plans, and a litany of other controversial items in the overhaul. But during the Feb. 25, 2010, health care summit between President Barack Obama and members of Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, pointed to the provision as one of his biggest problems with the bill. "It dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients," Alexander told Obama in his opening remarks. "So it's like giving someone a ticket to a bus line where the buses only run half the time." No one likes to wait for the bus, so we decided to look into Alexander's claim. Currently, Medicaid is available to low-income individuals who are pregnant, disabled, elderly or have children 18 years old or younger; the program covers about 60 million patients. The Senate and House health care bills, and Obama's latest health care proposal, would open up the program to all people under 65 with a low income. The Obama proposal and the Senate bill would offer Medicaid benefits to those with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, while the House version would allow those with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level to enroll. All that would mean a major expansion of the program. Medicaid is funded jointly by the states and the federal government, but administered by the states. So, the proposed expansion has proven particularly controversial among state officials, who say local budgets are already strapped and can't handle additional enrollees. One of the biggest complaints among doctors is that Medicaid reimbursements are already too low. We asked Alexander's office for some information on the statement, and his spokesman, Ryan Loskarn, pointed us to two recent studies about impacts of the potential law change. The first, compiled by the Congressional Budget Office, was published on Dec. 19, 2009, and looked at the impact of the Senate bill's Medicaid expansion provision. The CBO estimated that the expansion would increase the number of enrollees in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program by about 15 million, costing states about $26 billion over 10 years. (CBO does not specify how many of those would be only Medicaid patients, but the experts we spoke with told us that they would make up the vast majority of new enrollees.) The second study was published on Jan. 8, 2010, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. According to the report, the Senate bill would put 18 million people on the Medicaid beneficiary list. An additional 2 million with employer-sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid for supplemental coverage. So, if anything, Alexander is understating the high end of the overall estimate. Meanwhile, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy, estimated that Medicaid would enroll as many as 17.1 million new beneficiaries under the health care bill. So, by all accounts, Alexander is in the ballpark on how many people would be newly eligible for Medicaid. To back up the second part of Alexander's claim -- that 50 percent of doctors won't see new Medicaid patients -- Alexander's office pointed us to a 2007 Wall Street Journal article about access issues in Medicaid. The story mentioned a 2006 report from the Center for Studying Health System Change that estimated nearly half of doctors have stopped accepting or limited the number of Medicaid patients. According to that 2006 study, about 52 percent of doctors surveyed said they were accepting all new Medicaid patients, while only 21 percent said they were accepting no new patients. Presumably, the rest of the doctors surveyed were limiting to some degree the number of new Medicaid patients they were accepting. So, to say that 50 percent of doctors are accepting no new Medicaid patients based on that study is incorrect, said Alwyn Cassil, the group's director of public affairs. Furthermore, the Center for Studying Health System Change updated those figures in 2009 and provided more detail. Currently, 40.2 percent of doctors are accepting all new Medicaid patients, 12.4 percent are accepting most, 19.2 percent are accepting some, and 28.2 percent are accepting no new patients. Cassil did emphasize the fact that the 2006 study and the 2009 study are hard to compare because the group has changed its survey methods in the last few years. In 2006, for example, the group spoke with doctors over the phone. This time around, they administered a written survey. So, the group doesn't know if the most recent statistics are really worse than they were a few years ago or if patient rejection was simply underreported during the last survey. Nevertheless, Alexander raises a good point, Cassil said. "It is a valid point to raise, physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients," she said. "If you're going to be throwing another 15 million into the program, you've got to be thinking about that." Joan Alker, executive director for the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, agreed that Alexander's statement is generally true, but glosses over some important details. "I would say that certainly, access to physicians is a concern and that there's room for improvement," she said. "But being on Medicaid provides more access to patients," than they would get if they had no insurance at all. Alexander's statement "suggests that having Medicaid is meaningless, which is misleading." Leighton Ku, a health policy professor at George Washington University, said that those statistics are more nuanced than they seem. First, he pointed out, Medicaid patients surveyed often don't report great difficulty in finding doctors. But more importantly, Medicaid patients tend to be concentrated; there are many doctors that see just a few Medicaid patients, and a handful of clinics that see a lot. So, it's reasonable to think that some doctors aren't seeing new Medicaid patients because there are not many in their area. Finally, he said, many primary care physicians aren't seeing new patients at all, whether they are on Medicaid or have private insurance. In the first part of his statement, Alexander is in the ballpark: Anywhere from 15 to 18 million new patients could enroll in Medicaid if the health care overhaul is put into law. We also found that Alexander's underlying point, that some Medicaid patients might have trouble finding doctors, is a valid concern. But he overstates the percentage of doctors that won't accept new Medicaid patients and based that claim on old data. As a result, we find Alexander's claim to be Half True.

pomt-07735	Says Tri-Rail shows the potential problems with investing in high-speed rail.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-raps-tri-rail-while-rejecting/	It's become Florida Gov. Rick Scott's version of a campfire ghost story: Stay away from high-speed rail, or you'll wind up with a huge money suck on your hands. Just like Tri-Rail in South Florida. Scott has repeatedly tried to draw parallels between the two rail systems, saying the 71-mile commuter train now running through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties is hardly covering its costs. So why would the Orlando to Tampa system? Scott again drilled home the point during a national TV appearance on Feb. 27, 2011, when he was asked to explain his decision to reject $2.4 billion in federal funding for the high-speed rail line. "What I have said all along is our taxpayers aren't going to take the risk of the cost overrun in building it. It could be $3 billion ...," Scott told CNN's Candy Crowley. "We already have a train that goes from Palm Beach to Miami. Only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by the fares." While legislators and the Florida Department of Transportation said private contractors would be required to pay for any high-speed rail construction cost overruns, Scott halted the project before it went out for bid. So we can't really check that part of his statement. But we can examine his comparison to the Tri-Rail system. The numbers for Tri-Rail The Tri-Rail system started operating in 1989 as a temporary way to alleviate traffic congestion that was expected to be created by a massive road-widening project on Interstate 95. But the state Legislature decided to keep the system alive permanently through a funding agreement between the state and Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The federal government also helps fund the rail line through the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. A total of 3.6 million riders used Tri-Rail in fiscal year 2010, down from 4.2 million riders in FY 2009. Scott described his problems with Tri-Rail in more detail during a Feb. 21 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, and suggested its story acts as a warning for people considering the high-speed rail proposal. "Let's all remember. We have Tri-Rail right now. Tri-Rail costs us $64 million to operate. The fares only cover $10 million of it," he said. "The state's funding almost $35 million of that. So I'm not going to put our state taxpayers in a similar position." The fuller context of Scott's thoughts on Tri-Rail better explain his comment to CNN that only one-sixth of the cost of operation is covered by fares -- fares of about $10 million divided into a $64 million operating budget. We reached out to the governor's office to ask them about their figures, but we did not get a response. So we turned to the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees Tri-Rail. According to the authority's certified financial reports, Tri-Rail took in about $10.3 million in operating revenues in fiscal year 2010 -- an increase of $3 million since 2007. That's the good news. The bad? Operating expenses totaled $54.5 million in FY 2010, according to the financial reports. Bonnie Arnold, a spokeswoman for the authority, confirmed the figures in the report. She said the authority also received $10 million in federal money for preventative maintenance, which might be how Scott arrived at his $64 million figure. That's in addition to the normal operating subsidies provided by the federal government. The financial report concluded that rider fares covered between one-fourth and one-fifth of Tri-Rail's operating costs in 2010 (23 percent, see Page 63 of the report), up from 22 percent in 2009 and 19 percent in 2008. The rest of the money comes in the form of subsidies from the state, the counties and the federal government. The report reveals that Scott is a little off by saying one-sixth, which is the equivalent of about 17 percent. But the more important question is whether Tri-Rail's failures at the fare box really are evidence that high-speed rail won't work as it's proposed? Are the two rail lines enough alike for comparison? That's where this claim gets off track. A subsidy surprise? Governments and transportation experts walked into the Tri-Rail project with their eyes wide open. They knew the project would be subsidized by taxpayers. The question was just how much. The legislation that created the Tri-Rail line required the commuter system to recoup 60 percent of its operating costs. That number, however, was quickly panned as unrealistic. "Almost no one can recover that," then Tri-Rail executive director William Howard told the South Florida Business Journal in 1988, before the system was even operating. The pessimism was shared by George Sirianni, a public transportation specialist with the Florida Department of Transportation. Sixty percent is "really high," he said. "The national average for public transportation systems is only about 20 to 30 percent." In 1992, the state formally amended its requirement, saying that Tri-Rail needed to recoup 25 percent of its costs, according to the Miami Herald. That's about the what the system now pays for, though it's not what was initially anticipated by the Legislature. Compare that to the Tampa-Orlando line, where experts say there will be no public government subsidy. The most recent available ridership studies for the Tampa-Orlando line predict about 2.4 million riders in the system's first year, enough to cover the operational expenses of the system. In rejecting federal funding, Scott said he was briefed on a new ridership study that concluded the system would have 3.07 million riders annually. We're assuming the new study concludes that passengers will cover the costs to operate the high-speed rail line. (We can't say for certain because the state has yet to make that study available, and in fact, has taken down the official web site discussing the high-speed rail project.) So to recap, Tri-Rail was created with the idea it would be subsidized; high-speed rail is being proposed as a system that won't need government support. But that's not the only difference. The Tampa-Orlando line would have five stops over 84 miles of track, with trains reaching speeds up to 168 mph. A trip between Tampa and the Orlando International Airport would take 55 minutes, according to estimates. Tri-Rail, meanwhile, has 18 stops over 71 miles and it takes one hour, 55 minutes to travel from one end of the route to the other. Rob Gregg, director of transit management and innovation at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research, said high-speed rail is like an interstate while commuter rail is like a parkway. The clienteles, and costs, would be different, too, said Stephen L. Reich, another USF transportation expert. Tri-Rail is mainly intended to serve people coming to and from work, while more than one-third of projected passengers on the high-speed line would be tourists traveling from Orlando International Airport to Disney World. A one-way ticket on the high-speed rail would cost an estimated $15 to $30, depending on how far a rider travels. On Tri-Rail, commuters can purchase an unlimited monthly pass for $100 and a roundtrip ticket cost between $4.40 and $11.50. "The high-speed rail and Tri-Rail systems are different in technology, application and target markets," Gregg said. "Tri-Rail is targeting commuters/workers during peak congestion periods. The high-speed rail corridor surely targets tourists as well as business/commuter trips. "What should be reflected upon is the larger context of investing/subsidizing such systems relative to the entire transportation system (roads, transit, airports, etc.) and economic viability to the region (generating jobs, products, services and thus revenues)," Gregg said. "Disney, a profit-motivated business, 'subsidizes' its comprehensive transportation system (trams, buses, monorail, Cruise Coaches) as a part of its entire financial model." Look at the side-by-side of the two projects. In Tri-Rail's case, subsidies were always anticipated, but high-speed rail is projected to cover its own costs through ticket fares. Riders of Tri-Rail use the system to commute to work in South Florida, while Central Florida's high-speed rail will be used for more leisure and tourist travel. The ticket prices, train speeds and time schedules are all projected to be be dramatically different. The costs and benefits of Tri-Rail are simply not the same as the high-speed rail, and expecting them to operate the same way is misguided. Subsidies dog more than just rail projects Most of the talk here is about subsidies. Scott is right that they are typical for rail systems. But they also are typical for most every other form of transportation system. We did some research. In Jacksonville, the local bus service covers around only 20 percent of its costs through rider fares. The majority of its money comes from government -- the biggest chunk from the city of Jacksonville. In Pinellas County, riders are only paying for about 23 percent of the cost of the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority bus system, said spokesman Bob Lasher. Property tax collections are keeping that system running. Highways, too, rely on more than just fees paid by users through tolls or gas taxes. According to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trust, only half of the federal money set aside in 2007 for highway construction and maintenance was generated by user fees. That's down from 10 years earlier when user fees made up 61 percent of total spending on roads, Pew found. Scott has asked that the $2.4 billion he is rejecting for rail be used in the state for port and highway projects. The federal government has said the money will be used for rail. Robert Puentes, senior fellow and director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the comparison between Tri-Rail and high-speed rail is like comparing apples to oranges. "If comparing different types of rail, you would also have to look at highway travel and the enormous subsidies there to be fair," Puentes said. Our ruling If Scott were on a crusade to end public subsidies for all forms of transportation, that would be one thing. Transportation systems -- including roads, buses, ports and trains -- more than not require government help. But Scott is trying to isolate the problem to trains when citing Tri-Rail's revenue problems as a reason for nixing high-speed rail in Central Florida. It may be a convenient talking point, but the two systems are hardly alike. In the end, high-speed fail might fail and the projections for ridership might be too rosy. But people shouldn't use Tri-Rail as evidence any more than they should cite any other form of mass transit. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08693	John Boehner said the jobs of "teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters" are "'government jobs' that weren't worth saving."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/08/barack-obama/obama-says-boehner-doesnt-think-jobs-teachers-poli/	President Barack Obama defended his economic policies in a campaign-style speech in Milwaukee on Labor Day, drawing a sharp contrast with Republicans in Congress. "When it comes to just about everything we've done to strengthen our middle class, to rebuild our economy, almost every Republican in Congress says no," Obama said. "Even on things we usually agree on, they say no. If I said the sky was blue, they say no. If I said fish live in the sea, they'd say no." Obama mentioned specific legislation and singled out Republican House leader John Boehner of Ohio for criticism. "When we passed a bill earlier this summer to help states save jobs -- the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers and nurses and police officers and firefighters that were about to be laid off -- they said no. And the Republican who thinks he's going to take over as speaker... when he was asked about this, he dismissed those jobs as 'government jobs' that weren't worth saving. That's what he said, I'm quoting -- 'government jobs.'" We wanted to check Boehner's comments to see if Obama was making an accurate claim. Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10. It sends $26.1 billion to states facing budget shortfalls, providing $10 billion for salaries and compensation for teachers and another $16.1 million to help states pay for Medicaid, the long-standing government insurance program for the poor and disabled. Medicaid is a major part of state budgets, and Democrats says that this funding will help states avoid cuts to other parts of their budgets that pay for public employees like "nurses and police officers and firefighters." We want to be clear that the law only directly funds teachers. The other job categories are potential secondary effects and likely vary by state. We checked with the White House about what Boehner said about those jobs, and they pointed us to remarks he made in a major speech on the economy in Cleveland on Aug. 24, 2010. Boehner criticized the Obama administration's economic policies both broadly and in several specifics. One of the news highlights from the speech was Boehner's advice that Obama fire his top economic advisers, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council director Larry Summers. But Boehner also singled out the state aid package for brief criticism. Businesses, he said, are not creating jobs because of uncertainty about what the federal government will do, something he said he told Obama in a recent meeting. "Not long after we spoke, he signed a $26 billion 'stimulus' spending bill that funnels money to state governments in order to protect government jobs. And even worse, the bill is funded by a new tax hike that makes it more expensive to create jobs in the United States and less expensive to create jobs overseas. Listen, this cannot continue," Boehner said. (The quotes around "stimulus" are from the text Boehner's office posted online.) So, Boehner did call the jobs the bill aimed to save "government jobs." To be clear, public school teachers are government employees. But did Boehner say they "weren't worth saving"? The quote above is the only time Boehner specifically mentions that law in the speech, but he repeatedly condemns government spending and says that real job creation must come from the private sector. He does not mention the professions of teachers, nurses, police or firefighters, and he never said that "government jobs" weren't worth saving. We asked Boehner spokesman Michael Steel about Obama's charge. He said that Boehner "did not say that government jobs, 'weren't worth saving.' The president's statement is inaccurate." (Two days after the Labor Day speech, Obama repeated the remarks in a speech in Cleveland but softened them slightly. This time Obama said that Boehner "dismissed these jobs – teaching our kids, patrolling our streets, rushing into burning buildings – as quote 'government jobs – jobs that I guess he thought just weren't worth saving.") Obama's Labor Day statement was accurate in that Boehner did refer did refer to teachers' jobs as government jobs. But the Republican leader did not say government jobs weren't worth saving. He merely said the stimulus was misguided because it put too much emphasis on government spending. So we rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15124	"Contrary to media reports, Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/09/e-frank-stephenson/georgia-gas-taxes-despite-pump-price-fall/	Anyone who took a road trip over Labor Day – or paid attention to headlines over the holiday – couldn’t help but notice prices at the pump. The national average of regular gasoline hovered at $2.40 a gallon over the weekend and dipped another penny to $2.39 a gallon by Tuesday, according to AAA. Georgia matched that average, and Atlanta even fared better, with metro drivers paying an average of $2.34 a gallon. That’s the lowest price since 2004 – despite a change in the state gasoline tax over the summer that critics warned was a tax hike for Georgia drivers. PolitiFact Georgia already ruled claims about a tax hike as Mostly True. The chairman of Berry College’s economics department, writing for the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, suggested that media reports were "surprising" given the change would not and did not mean higher gas prices. "Contrary to media reports, Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump," according to the piece by economics professor E. Frank Stephenson and student Clay G. Collins. "There may well be some good reasons to criticize the transportation bill, but hiking gas taxes isn’t one of them." Did we miss something in our earlier assessment of Georgia’s gas taxes? We decided to revisit the issue and, sadly, the math. The history As a reminder, lawmakers changed how drivers pay gas taxes as of July 1, as part of a larger transportation funding bill. Switching from a 7.5 cent per gallon and excise tax and a 4 percent state sales tax per gallon to a single 26 cent excise tax on gasoline is projected to raise nearly $670 million this year. In our previous fact-check, we noted that the effective rate then would jump from 17 cents per gallon to 26 cents, or 9 cents before local sales taxes are included. However, analysts at the right-leaning Tax Foundation pointed out that the price of gas would play a role in the final price. In short, prices weren’t expected to jump 9 cents overnight. But the amount motorists paid would increase over time, as gas prices and inflation increased. The Berry College analysis Stephenson did something similar in his analysis. He and Collins (a student who did not return requests for comment) used AAA and gasbuddy.com to find monthly gas prices in Georgia and the surrounding states for June and July – before and after the change took place here. In June, the research showed Georgians paid an average of $2.71 per gallon of gas. They paid about $2.63 a gallon in July – a drop of 8 cents after the change in how taxes are paid. Stephenson and Collins used prices in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee as the control for market factors such as crude oil prices. They found the neighboring states’ average price per gallon was $2.59 in June and $2.51 in July. In other words, Georgia saw the same drop in gas prices as its neighbors, even though it alone changed how it taxed gasoline. In an email, Stephenson rejected the idea that change created a net tax increase, given those final prices. "Market prices indicate otherwise because Georgia’s gas prices changed in line with neighboring states," Stephenson wrote. "Your suggestion is that prices in neighboring states should have decreased 8-9 cents more than prices in Georgia but that just didn’t happen." Math matters The figures Stephenson uses in his analysis are easily, and readily verifiable. But does the price at the pump really mean taxes didn’t go up? Not if you do the math, which PolitiFact Georgia did with the help of a second economist, Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State professor who specialties include public sector taxation. Using Stephenson’s own figures, we first looked at what would have happened if, in June, the new tax system was in effect. That requires taking the $2.71 pump price, and subtracting the then-existing 7.5-cent excise tax to get to $2.62 and dividing by the state and local sales taxes of 7 percent. That leaves us with a $2.46 per gallon price, without taxes. Under the new tax structure of a 26 cent excise tax and 3 percent local sales tax on every gallon, the price would have been $2.79. In other words, there would have been about an 8 cent increase in the price if the new system was in place in June. And in July? Applying similar math, the $2.63 pump price would have been $2.45 without any taxes. And under the previous tax system, the pump price would have been $2.54 per gallon – meaning motorists would have paid about 9 cents less had the tax structure not changed. Seaman said while it was an interesting point that Georgia’s change in prices was similar to neighboring states, the data likely exaggerates the point that the tax increase is just not immediately evident. "My dilemma is he concludes that Georgia did not experience a net tax increase, even though when holding market forces constant, the math suggests there was," Seaman said. "I have to admit, as I’m sitting here right now, I don’t have a great explanation for why, even over one month, we benefitted more in the market than other states from the decline in refinery gas prices," Seaman added. "But that doesn’t change the math, that there is a net tax increase." Stephenson did not respond to specific questions about the math but said the argument that the market is camouflaging the tax increase "relies on having some price decrease that was specific to Georgia, was the same magnitude as the putative tax increase, and was at the same time as the would-be tax increase." An 18-month review of gas prices show that Georgia’s prices have increased relative to neighboring states but did not during the tax change, Stephenson added. But Seaman said even that data had anomalies that "are not inconsistent with Georgia having bigger price reductions, without the tax change, and lower prices than other states." Our ruling In Atlanta’s car-centric world, gas prices are nearly as hot a topic as bad drivers. So Berry College economist E. Frank Stephenson caught our attention with his piece that the change how Georgia taxes gasoline was "much ado about nothing" because an analysis of prices before and after the change show rather than increasing taxes, pump prices went down this summer. "Georgia’s gas tax change led to no price increase at the pump," Stephenson wrote in dismissing warnings of a tax increase. Stephenson is correct that average gas prices dropped this summer in Georgia, where we plunged to an 11-year low during the recent Labor Day weekend. He used neighboring states to show that Georgia prices dropped the same as states that did not alter their gas taxes this summer. That analysis, however, doesn’t indicate what sorts of market forces could depress pump prices, even as a growing share of that cost is taxes. And, the math shows just what was predicted when Georgia switched to a higher statewide excise tax on July 1: motorists paying several cents more per gallon than they would have under the former system. If not for the tax change, Georgia motorists would be paying even less at the pump now. Stephenson uses accurate numbers but leaves out critical facts that provide that important context. We rate his claim Half True.	None	E. Frank Stephenson	None	None	None	2015-09-09T00:00:00	2015-08-14	['None']
pomt-14133	Cervical cancer in Africa is "fully preventable with basic education, screening and vaccines."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/05/joe-biden/biden-says-cervical-cancertotally-preventable-afri/	Vice President Joe Biden has called for a "moonshot" to cure cancer. The disease took his son in 2015, and now it has become his mission to eliminate some cancers and turn the rest into treatable, chronic diseases. Biden took his campaign to the Vatican where he said that "nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable." "Take cervical cancer --  530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year," Biden said. "270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, it’s the second-most common cancer after breast cancer. It’s a travesty. But it’s fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines." Biden’s comment about cervical cancer in Africa caught our attention. Is cervical cancer fully preventable with the right interventions? A fact-sheet on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website tells us that Biden is almost but not quite right. "Every year in the U.S., more than 12,000 women get cervical cancer, and 4,000 die from it. 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination." Now, that is for the United States with a system of doctors, clinics and hospitals that far surpasses anything found in any African nation. If it’s not fully preventable here, it’s difficult to see why the results in Africa would be better. Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University is in the middle of a study on cervical cancer strategies in Africa. Meyerson told us "Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention." Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, said the vice president was trying to make a slightly different point. "The vice president was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable," Dubyak said. To be sure, cervical cancer is highly preventable. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, says "cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in countries that have instituted and maintained national screening programs." In this light, Biden’s statement draws attention to Africa’s unfortunate distinction. As this World Health Organization map shows, it is a hotspot worldwide for cervical cancer. In every dark blue country, the rate of new cases is over 30.2 per 100,000 women per year. By comparison, the rate in the United States is about 8.1 per 100,000 women per year. Of the 20 nations with the highest incidence of cervical cancer, 16 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Some researchers note there are vast gaps in this cancer data and say the true prevalence "remains largely unknown.") A 2015 report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, a body of physicians, epidemiologists and cancer researchers, described the key reasons behind the reach of the disease. Screening is sorely lacking. The group found a "lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, lack of the high-quality laboratories needed for cytology based screening and absence of adequate centres for the evaluation and treatment of identified patients." Dealing with cervical cancer exposes the many cracks in the health care systems across the region. Richard Wamai, assistant professor of public health at Northeastern University, said the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are ill equipped for this challenge. "Detection will require expanding the health service system, which requires investments in infrastructure," Wamai said. "That calls for prioritization which is difficult to do because of competing health demands. Cancer in general is, to me, the most worrying of all other diseases for the continent. There is very little preparation and in many cases policy makers are not yet awoken to this impending tsunami." Public health experts also say vaccination programs are essential. Some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer and some of those strains can be blocked by vaccines. But just as Sub-Saharan countries lack the infrastructure for screening, they also lack a system for vaccinating young women. Speaking at a January 2016 event in Washington, Deborah Birx, U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, gave a bleak summary of the status of health care in Sub-Saharan Africa. "There is no systematic health care for girls between the time they turn 5 and the time they get pregnant," Birx said. That age range would be key for any vaccination program. On top of that core challenge, Meyerson said the price tag for vaccines puts them out of reach. "Many African countries find that the HPV vaccination cost is too high to have broad coverage," Meyerson said. Our ruling Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is "fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines." The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

pomt-01169	The authors of a report on CIA’s torture techniques "never interviewed a single CIA official."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-committees-torture-report-failed-/	In a preemptive strike to a Senate committee report detailing past examples of alleged torture by the CIA, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio called the release of the document "reckless and irresponsible." Rubio raised concerns that the release could endanger lives of Americans overseas, incite violence and create problems for our allies. "The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. taxpayers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official," Rubio wrote in a statement with Sen. Jim. Risch, R-Idaho, on Dec. 8. The report garnered widespread media coverage upon its release. But did the authors really fail to interview a single CIA official? We took a closer look. CIA torture report drew from inspector general interviews On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11 that had been years in the making. About 500 pages of the 6,700 page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as "rectal rehydration" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. Rubio has a point that the committee did not conduct face-to-face interviews with CIA employees and contractors. Here’s how the report addresses that point: "CIA employees and contractors who would otherwise have been interviewed by the committee staff were under potential legal jeopardy, and therefore the CIA would not compel its workforce to appear before the committee." But there are two wrinkles. First, then-CIA Director Michael Hayden -- whose tenure started in 2006 years after the interrogation techniques under scrutiny started -- testified in a closed-door session before the committee in 2007, though the committee deemed the testimony less than entirely helpful. A 38-page appendix in the report -- "Example of Inaccurate CIA Testimony to the Committee April 12, 2007" -- shows how Hayden’s testimony conflicted with CIA records on multiple points including the number of detainees, the information gleaned from them and interrogation tactics used. For example, Hayden suggested that the CIA interrogation program was successful in obtaining intelligence from all detainees. But the report counters, "CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports." The second problem with Rubio’s claim is that the report did draw from existing interviews of CIA officials, not to mention "more than six million pages of CIA materials," including "operational cables, intelligence reports, internal memoranda and emails, briefing materials" and other records. Specifically, the committee had access to interviews of CIA officials that had been conducted by the CIA's inspector general, as well as the CIA’s oral history program. A background document provided by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee’s chair, stated, "These documents included summaries of more than 100 CIA inspector general interviews with extensive quotations, as well as CIA cables, emails, letters, briefing notes, intelligence products, classified testimony, and other records. Of particular value were the interview summaries, which included responses to many of the questions the committee would have asked had the committee been able to conduct its own interviews." The interview reports and transcripts included former CIA director George Tenet; Jose Rodriguez, director of the CIA’s counterterrorism center, CIA General Counsel Scott Muller; CIA Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt; CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo; CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin; and a variety of interrogators, lawyers, medical personnel, senior counterterrorism analysts and managers of the detention and interrogation program, according to Feinstein. Rubio spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said the senator didn’t count Hayden’s interview because it pre-dated the 2009 start of work on the report. "Any appearance before that was simply the CIA director appearing before the oversight committee," told PolitiFact. As for the transcripts of prior interviews, Sammon echoed a point in the Republicans’ minority report that argues that transcripts of interviews done by the inspector general aren’t the same as if the committee had done their own, fresh interviews. The minority report criticizes the study for "failure to interview the relevant intelligence officers" and argues that it led to "significant analytical and factual errors." Republicans withdrew their participation in the study in 2009 when Attorney General Eric Holder decided to re-open the criminal inquiry. But the minority report argues that the committee could have interviewed witnesses after the Justice Department closed the investigation in August 2013. Examples of information from CIA interviews cited in report However, there’s ample evidence that the interviews of CIA officials provided the report’s authors with details about the interrogation of specific detainees and techniques. For example, it includes multiple statements about "Cobalt," a detention facility. The agency’s chief of interrogations told the inspector general that Cobalt "is good for interrogations because it is the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon, facilitating the displacement of detainee expectations." One senior interrogator told the inspector general that his team found one detainee who, "'as far as we could determine,' had been chained to the wall in a standing position for 17 days." The report also includes information about the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11. James Pavitt , the CIA’s deputy director of operations, told the inspector general that he "did not recall specifically ordering that a detainee be waterboarded right away," but he "did not discount that possibility." Experts weigh in on the report We checked with intelligence experts to see whether the lack of face-to-face interviews with CIA employees (other than Hayden) casts a shadow on the report, and most said the committee had plenty of testimony to draw from without them. While in-person interviews with CIA officials could have potentially been useful to the committee, said Anthony Clark Arend, a government and foreign service professor at Georgetown University, "all the necessary information that could have been obtained from those interviews was available to the committee through other means." University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, said the large amount of information from CIA officials available from the inspector general and other sources meant that the Senate panel had "ample basis on which to draw conclusions." "Indeed, this testimony could be viewed as more reliable than anything officials might have given directly to an investigating committee, given that such a committee and staff might have been viewed as adversarial," she said. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, noted that the CIA was given the opportunity to respond to the draft report. He also noted that the CIA’s current director, John Brennan, submitted his response to the committee and mentioned that an agency review team responded to the report. "I do not think the reliance on other investigative transcripts—especially those of the CIA IG —in any way diminishes the power of this report summary," Eddington said. Our ruling Rubio said that the authors of a report on CIA’s torture techniques "never interviewed a single CIA official." He has a point that the committee did not conduct fresh, face-to-face interviews with CIA officers as it was writing the report. However, this glosses over important context. The committee used testimony by then-CIA director Hayden, and the committee had access to transcripts of numerous prior interviews of key CIA officials conducted by the Inspector General and other entities. Rubio’s statement creates the misleading impression that the report wasn’t based at all on interviews with CIA employees, and that’s not the case. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-12-11T11:08:36	2014-12-08	['Central_Intelligence_Agency']
pomt-02332	Florida's revenue "is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/26/jeb-bush/floridas-revenue-growing-faster-rate-almost-any-st/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush waved off any talk of a 2016 presidential run at a meeting of Broward County business leaders on March 21, 2014. Instead, he spent a lot of time talking up Florida’s rebound from the Great Recession. Bush said Tallahassee had been hit hard in the last few years, but was making a comeback. "The revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country, because our state has been fiscally well managed and we grew our way out of the hole," he told attendees at the Broward Workshop business breakfast in Davie. It’s probably fair to say the state has bounced back from the worst of the economic downturn, but is the revenue rate outpacing the rest of the country? We wanted to hold Bush accountable. Revenue reporting State revenues can include any number of sources -- property taxes, sales taxes, corporate income taxes, agency fees and even the Lottery. Florida doesn’t have a personal income tax, relying heavily on sales tax dollars. We asked Bush’s camp to elaborate on what the former governor meant when he made the claim, but they didn’t specify how he arrived at his conclusion. Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, suggested looking at general revenue numbers since 2008, when the effects of the recession really began to take hold nationwide. General revenue from a state’s own sources is a better way to account for budgeting, because unlike total revenue accounting, it’s not subject to federal aid or trust fund cash. The Institute used Census data to calculate total taxes and miscellaneous general revenue to determine how much each state brought in for fiscal year 2012, the last year with complete Census data. (Dadayan said the Census Bureau’s annual numbers are more reliable than quarterly data.) The institute found the state’s collections for taxes and other revenue were still 7 percent lower in 2012 (almost $48 billion) compared with 2008 (almost $51.6 billion), making Florida 15th out of 19 states that had not yet rebounded to pre-recession levels. "The numbers don’t support the statement, if we look at the bigger picture, rather than the nominal growth in the most recent quarters," Dadayan said. If we were to look at total revenue in the same time period, Florida has risen dramatically from 2008 ($68.9 billion) to 2012 ($82.8 billion), about 20 percent. That increase is impressive until you compare it to a year earlier, when the state’s total revenue was $98.2 billion. That means Florida is down 15.7 percent since 2007. Many reports look at revenue in terms of total taxes, including income and sales taxes, by quarters, which gives us another option for examining the data. So what is the most recent quarterly growth rate, and how does it compare to the rest of the country? Between the first and second quarters of 2013, Florida had a 4.5 percent increase in total tax revenues, the Rockefeller Institute reported. That makes Florida 33rd in the nation for revenue growth. If we do that calculation as a year-over-year change from 2012 to 2013, the Institute said Florida had a 4 percent rate increase during the fourth quarter. In that measure, Florida is 17th among all states. The National Conference of State Legislatures focused on state general fund revenues in its report on State Budget Actions for the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years. That measure excluded intergovernmental funds and revenues dedicated to programs outside of the general fund, policy analyst Todd Haggerty said. The report found Florida’s revenue increased 5.9 percent from fiscal year 2012 to 2013. That made Florida 20th on the list. For fiscal year 2014, the NCSL estimated the state’s general fund growth rate at 4.5 percent, putting Florida in a tie for seventh place with Massachusetts. That’s a specific measure based on an estimate for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. So while there are other ways to parse numbers, there’s not much to support the claim, according to Nick Johnson, the vice president for state fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He said the 2014 estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, because every state reports its own estimates, and those estimates have different criteria. States also account for general funds differently. "On the whole, I'd say Florida's revenue growth lately has been mediocre, certainly nothing to brag about," Johnson said. The ruling Bush said that "the revenue of the state is growing at a faster rate than almost any state in the country." A few reports compiled with data encompassing different kinds of revenue can be confusing, but all paint the same picture: Florida revenues are still down from pre-recession levels, and don’t generally reflect a growth rate consistent with what Bush is claiming, either annually or in recent quarters. There is one report that says 2014 general revenue is expected to grow at a rate in the top 10 of all states. That data is self-reported from the state, however, and is only an estimate. According to experts we talked to, the Sunshine State is lagging behind the rest of the nation when it comes to getting its revenues back to pre-recession levels. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11143	Speaking of immigration cases, says, "We have thousands of judges."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/30/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-about-thousands-immigrat/	President Donald Trump has denounced the way the United States processes immigration cases, calling for thousands more judges to address a backlog on top of the current ranks. Trump highlighted the role of judges in immigration proceedings in early May after he falsely attributed a "catch and release" immigration practice to Democrats. "We have thousands of judges. Do you think other countries have judges?" Trump said. "We give them, like, trials. That’s the good news. The bad news is, they never show up for the trial. Okay?" In a May 24 interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Trump again said the United States was the only country that had judges, while others had "security people. People that stand there and say you can't come in." "We have thousands of judges, and they need thousands of more judges. The whole system is corrupt. It's horrible," Trump said. "So yeah, you need thousands of judges based on this crazy system. Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from? You know a judge is a very special person. How do you hire thousands of people to be a judge? So it's ridiculous. We are going to change the system. We have no choice for the good of our country." Trump’s conversation with Kilmeade centered on immigration, so we wondered if there are "thousands of judges" clearing immigration cases. Far from it. Fewer than 400 judges currently have this task. There also aren’t that many federal judges who hear other matters. (Immigration is regulated at the federal level.) There are slightly over 1,300 Article III federal judges that serve on the the Supreme Court, courts of appeals, district courts, and U.S. Court of International Trade. Adding the current number of immigration judges to that count still falls short of "thousands." The White House did not offer data to back Trump’s claim of "thousands" of judges, but pointed to remarks he made in April about increasing the number of immigration judges. "We’re trying to hire thousands of judges," Trump said during a roundtable discussion on tax reform. The number of pending immigration cases has been increasing over the years. In fiscal year 2008, there were about 186,000 pending cases. That number has grown substantially over the last decade. Nearly 700,000 immigration cases were pending as of March 31, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for the hiring of at least 100 additional immigration judge teams with a goal of fielding 484 immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019, according to an April report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. (Judge teams consist of an immigration judge, judicial law clerk, legal assistant, and three administrative support staff, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.) The Office of the Chief Immigration Judge within the U.S. Justice Department provides direction and sets priorities for the approximately 350 immigration judges located in about 60 immigration courts throughout the country, according to the Justice Department. James McHenry, director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, pegged the number of immigration judges at 334 in an April statement to a Senate committee. "The reference to ‘thousands’ of immigration judges is inaccurate," said Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. The Executive Office for Immigration Review has historically faced challenges filling positions due to a department-wide hiring freeze between January 2011 and February 2014, and to normal attrition, said Jeremy McKinney, secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Still, there are not thousands of immigration judges, he said, "not even close." Our ruling Speaking of immigration cases, Trump said, "We have thousands of judges." There are fewer than 400 immigration judges nationwide. The number of Article III federal judges is about 1,300. Even a combination of those numbers falls short of thousands. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-05-30T16:35:03	2018-05-24	['None']

pomt-11805	Under Scott Walker, "average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/17/matt-flynn/wages-under-scott-walker-less-under-jim-doyle-demo/	The day before Gov. Scott Walker made his re-election run official, Matt Flynn issued a pre-emptive strike, comparing the two-term Republican unfavorably to another two-term Wisconsin governor, Democrat Jim Doyle. "Scott Walker’s time is up," was how Flynn, a Democrat running in the 2018 race for governor, began his Nov. 4, 2017 news release. "Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle." Walker, who has been governor since 2011, has used a number of economic statistics to argue that things are better than they were under Doyle, who served from 2003 through 2010. So, let’s see how the claim from Flynn, a lawyer and former chairman of the state Democratic Party, stands up. Under Walker, are average wages lower in Wisconsin than they were under Doyle? The claim alludes to Walker bearing some responsibility, but doesn’t directly blame him. And governors play an important but limited role in wages. Flynn’s evidence To back Flynn’s claim, his campaign cited two sets of statistics, both adjusted for inflation. 1. Under Walker in 2016, the median hourly wage was $17.43 -- 5 cents lower than in 2009 under Doyle, "before the full effects of the Great Recession set in." The figures are from the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics, which are estimates based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors in Wisconsin. But Doyle served another full year. The figure for 2010 was $17.37 -- 6 cents lower than in 2016 under Walker. More importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warns against using this particular set of data to make comparisons over time. So, we’re discounting this point. 2. The median hourly wage eclipsed $18 in 2003, 2005 and 2010 under Doyle -- but through 2016, had not reached that level under Walker. The figure in 2010, Doyle’s last full year in office, was $18.10, higher than the latest inflation-adjusted figure for Walker, $17.96 in 2016. That’s according to a 2017 report by COWS, formerly known as the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The report cites statistics produced by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The Washington, D.C.-based institute says it used Current Population Survey data, produced jointly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, that are good for comparisons over time. So, the second statistic tends to support Flynn’s claim -- although both statistics he cites are for median wages, rather than average. While average is the term Flynn used, many people use that word even when referring to median. Some economists recommend using the median, since it is a midpoint -- half of people earned wages below that point and half were above. In contrast, the average can be greatly influenced by extremes; for example, it will be pulled higher if there are many people earning very high incomes. Our numbers We produced our own inflation-adjusted numbers for average wages, the term Flynn used, with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that can be used for comparisons over time. The average weekly wage in Wisconsin in 2016 was $885 -- higher than every year under Doyle -- according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The QCEW figures come from quarterly counts of employment and wages reported by employers covering more than 95 percent of U.S. jobs. By another measure, for only the private sector, the average weekly wage in August 2017 was $827 -- higher than the August figure for every year under Doyle dating back to 2007 -- according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics figures. (Figures before 2007 are not available). So, the average wage under Walker is higher than when Doyle left office in 2010. Our rating Flynn says that under Walker, "average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle." Adjusting for inflation, the average wage is higher under Walker than it was when Doyle left office in 2010. But sometimes people use the more common term average when they’re actually referring to the median -- which some economists say is a better measure for wages because an average can be distorted by people who earn very high wages. The median wage was higher when Doyle left office than it is under Walker. Flynn’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-11134	"We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/ben-sasse/protectionism-big-part-great-depression-ben-sasse-/	Shortly after the Trump administration said it would slap tariffs on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., released a tersely worded statement on the looming "trade war." "This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression," Sasse's statement said. " 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.' " Does Sasse have his history right when he says, "We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression"? He does, as we’ve recounted previously. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found. In a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.) Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here): "In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression." Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse. Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 — sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. — raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street’s "Black Tuesday" on Oct. 29, 1929. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own. Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is quite accurate. Expert opinions Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was "no real reason" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for "domestic political reasons." In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists. "Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression," Irwin said, but he added that it’s fair to say it made the depression "longer and more painful." After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports. "Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump," Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that "if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time." Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office. As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan. This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression. "Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small," said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century. For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade. Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said. "It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism," said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. "However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression." Our ruling Sasse said, "We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression." While the downturn that became the Great Depression had been under way for about half a year by the time the United States passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, economists agree that the resulting trade war worsened the impact on both the global and domestic economy. Sasse was cautious to say that the tariffs were "a big part" — rather than the only reason — for the Great Depression. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-05320	On signing a no-tax pledge	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-rejected-state-tax-pledge-signing-nati/	These days, it’s hard for candidates to claim they truly oppose taxes if they haven’t put it in writing. As a presidential candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney signed a pledge to forswear tax increases. In fact, in his official tax proposal, Romney has advocated across-the-board tax cuts. But has he been consistent over the years about putting his commitment not to raise taxes in the form of a pledge? The question about Romney and the tax pledge was raised in late 2007, when the Democratic National Committee released a 30-second ad and a four-minute video charging, among other things, that Romney had changed his position on signing a no-tax pledge. We checked the ad shortly after it came out. In this report, we’ll put that question to the Flip-O-Meter. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. Romney and the 2002 gubernatorial campaign During his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Romney said he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group. Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news: "In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge," the newspaper wrote. "Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing." The article went on to quote Romney saying, "I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues." The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. "I'm against tax increases," Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. "But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth." Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. "He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges," she suggested to the Globe. Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted Eric Fehrnstrom, then Romney’s deputy campaign manager, saying, "Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear." In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge "government by gimmickry," the newspaper reported. Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general. Romney’s decision on a pledge in late 2006 On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate in the 2008 presidential election to sign a prominent taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, an influential anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. "In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense," Norquist said in a news release. "Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests." Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. "For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases," Romney said in the ad. "I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy." In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate. It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context. The Massachusetts text was a "pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes." The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements. Our ruling In 2002, Romney refused to make "a pledge in writing" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that’s a Full Flop.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-17T16:51:18	2007-01-04	['None']
pomt-02555	"Eighty-five percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/03/scott-surovell/surovell-says-85-percent-states-have-stopped-using/	The possibility that Virginia will return to its electric chair to execute all condemned prisoners is shocking to Del. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax. Since 1995, Virginia has given such prisoners a choice in their manner of death: lethal injection or electrocution. Seventy-nine inmates have died by injection; seven chose the chair. Drug manufacturers have stopped producing the products used to put people to death by lethal injection. Virginia’s supply ran out on Nov. 30. The House of Delegates, on a largely party-line vote on Jan. 22, passed a bill saying if drugs for the lethal injections are unavailable, electrocution will be used instead. Surovell led the Democratic debate against the bill, saying Virginia should seek a more humane form of capital punishment rather than return to the electric chair. "Eighty-five percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it," he said. We wondered if that statistic is accurate. Surovell sent us two articles to back his statement. One was a 1994 study by Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, which said that 26 states have used electrocution dating to the 19th century. Surovell also sent us a December 2012 article in Virginia Lawyer that cited Denno’s number of 26 states once allowing electrocutions, but added that all but four "have now moved away from it -- either by legislative abandonment or judicial ruling." That translates to an 85 percent drop in states. The four states that still allow electrocutions, the article said, are Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and Florida. Two more -- Kentucky and Tennessee -- permit prisoners convicted only before 1998 and 1999, respectively, to select electrocution. The U.S. Department of Justice has different numbers, but they’re misleading. The department issued a report last July saying that as of 2011, the 36 states with capital punishment all allowed lethal injections. Eight of those states, DOJ said, also allowed for the possibility of electrocutions. Two of the states really don’t belong on the list, however, because their laws do not currently permit use of electric chairs. Arkansas allows any inmate convicted of a capital offense on or before July 4, 1983 to request death by electrocution. But there are no prisoners left on the state’s death row that qualify for the option. Oklahoma’s law "authorizes electrocution if lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional." That hasn’t happened. Our Ruling Surovell said, "85 percent of the states in the United States that had electrocution have now abolished it." Academic research shows 26 states have allowed electrocutions since the 19th century. A review of laws today shows that six states may still use their electric chairs at a condemned prisoner’s request. That means 77 percent of the states that had electrocutions have ended the practice. Surovell is right that states are shutting down their electric chairs, but his percentage is slightly off. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Surovell	None	None	None	2014-02-03T10:40:01	2014-01-21	['United_States']
pomt-07115	Says tax revenue was lower than expected in May and "that's basically a clear indication the governor's counselors are probably right -- that we are still not out of the woods yet."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/20/chris-widener/state-sen-chris-widener-says-may-tax-revenue-dip-s/	For the past year, the financial outlook for the state of Ohio has been on a gradual upswing marked by a dropping state unemployment rate and rising tax revenues that have outpaced expectations each month since June 2010. The rising financial tide has brought with it questions from reporters trying to sort out what and how much money the state may have left at the end of the fiscal year 2011 on June 30. And it has left Statehouse Republicans eager to tamp down on the speculation that there will be hundreds of millions in "extra money" lying around to potentially ease the burden of deep cuts made to state government, K-12 education and other areas of the state budget. That was the backdrop on the evening of June 7, just a few minutes after the Senate Finance Committee voted out the state budget, when Sen. Chris Widener, the committee's chairman, was asked about what the state might do with the "hundreds of millions" left in the bank in excess revenue for 2011. The Springfield Republican suggested that the state's economic recovery could nosedive at any moment and talked about sitting in on a meeting with a half-dozen financial experts on the governor's board of economic advisers who had "very disparaging reports" on the future of the American economy. Trying to hammer home his point that future revenue growth in the state is a shaky proposition, Widener referenced the state’s tax revenues for May, which had just been released. "You know the revenue estimates for the month of May? I think the (Senate) President (Niehaus) mentioned after session. We’re down for the month as compared to estimated revenue," he told reporters. "That's not a good sign. That's basically a clear indication the governor's counselors are probably right--that we are still not out of the woods yet. We're going month by month." Widener made a similar remark on June 15 during a public budget conference committee meeting. With tax revenues running above estimates for every month since June 2010, a poor showing in May could certainly be interpreted as an ominous sign. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check if May's tax revenue was really down as Widener suggested, and if so, what could be the cause. We started with tax revenue data was released by the state budget office prior to Widener's statement. It showed May tax sources off by $3.8 million -- a negative 0.2 percent of all tax revenues. However, one of the best indications of the health of Ohio's economy relative to expectations -- personal income tax -- was $94 million above estimates. So what caused collections to come up short? It turns out domestic insurance tax, which Ohio insurance companies pay on the premiums they collect, was the guilty party. Revenue from that tax for May was 48 percent below estimates for the month, which adds up to a whopping $87 million, according to the revenue data. Dave Pagnard, a spokesman for the state budget office, said in an e-mail that the numbers for domestic insurance tax were off because of the timing of the mailings of the billings -- notices were sent too late in May for the payments to be received in time to count in the monthly numbers. He forwarded a 26-page Monthly Financial Report dated June 10, 2011 from state budget director Tim Keen to Gov. John Kasich that gives a detailed explanation about what happened with the domestic insurance shortfall. "This is primarily attributable to the loose billings and payment schedule for this tax as the Department of Insurance must certify the amount of billings to the Treasurer of State no later than the first Monday in May (May 2nd). The Treasurer of State then has up to 20 days after certification to send out the bills. Those billed then have 20 to 30 days after certification to submit payment," the report says. "As a result of this issue, the balance of the May billings (which totaled $195.5 million) will be received in June and thus June receipts for this tax should exceed the estimate by approximately the same amount of the May shortfall." Translation: It's a timing issue. The state of Ohio will pick the money up in June so the numbers aren't really off by $87 million -- only a temporarily accounting problem. In fact, had the domestic insurance revenue not been delayed, the state would have been $82.2 million in the black for the month of May. So how does Widener’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? The Senate Finance chair offered up the failure of the state to hit its tax revenue marks in May as evidence that Ohio could be sliding back from a gradual recovery. And while it’s true that the state was under revenue estimates -- just barely -- it's a mirage based on the state's domestic insurance tax notices going out too late in May for most of them to be returned within the calendar month. While Widener was correct that May's tax revenues were slightly below estimates, he said it was "clear evidence" that Ohio is "not out of the woods yet" and could fall back into an economic decline. There’s room for debate on the progress of economic recovery in Ohio, but in this case the numbers were really nothing more than evidence of bureaucracy in state government. The lower than expected revenues were a result of timing, not depressed collections. That’s a critical fact. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that contains an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give listeners a different impression gets one rating: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03286	Says the 2014-15 state budget "cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/02/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-2014-15-state-budget-cut-border-s/	In a video announcing his run for lieutenant governor June 27, 2013, state Sen. Dan Patrick said that border security is a federal responsibility but Texas’ problem, and the state shouldn’t budget less for it. "This year’s budget, despite increasing nearly 9 percent, actually cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs," the Houston Republican said. "It was one of the reasons I voted against the budget." In a recent PolitiFact check, we found that state spending (aka general revenue) rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Did that include cuts to combating gangs and securing the border? Analysis showed us that wasn’t exactly so -- in fact, budgeted border spending rose about $118 million. Border security has been a fiscal priority for Gov. Rick Perry, who has urged state efforts to supplement federal border operations starting in 2005. In 2010, he said those efforts had decreased border crime 60 percent, a claim we rated as Pants on Fire largely because its basis was crime in rural areas only, excluding towns and cities. Texas’ border security efforts, according to an April 2013 issue brief from the Legislative Budget Board staff, began with state programs funded by federal grants in 2005-2007, followed by lawmakers signing off on $124 million in state spending from 2008-09 through 2012-13. State border operations are coordinated by the Governor's Office of Homeland Security within the Department of Public Safety, it said. The state created centers in the border area and Austin to gather intelligence, built a crime laboratory in Laredo, used software to map criminal activities in real time and coordinated federal, state, local and private law enforcement, the brief said, and also bought six aircraft, six patrol boats and 326 patrol vehicles. Patrick spokesman Logan Spence told us by email that Patrick’s claim referred to three specific categories of DPS spending in the biennial budget: "organized crime," "border security" and "local border security." Spence emailed us summaries from the budget board, which advises lawmakers on state funding issues, giving the amounts appropriated for those categories in the past two budgets sent to Gov. Perry. The summaries, from Sept. 7, 2011, and May 20, 2013, showed all-funds spending, meaning state plus federal and other funds: "Organized crime" -- $17.4 million drop, from $134.6 million to $117.2 million. "Border security" plus "local border security" -- $6.1 million drop, from $89 million to $82.9 million. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us via email that those changes were attributable to funds being moved to different areas within the department, plus "one-time big ticket items" under border spending and revised estimates for items such as federal grants in the "organized crime" spending. Spence had also sent us budget board summaries that wrapped in border operations conducted under Texas Parks and Wildlife and Trusteed Programs in the Governor’s Office. Those summaries, from May 2011 and June 2013, indicated that all-funds border security spending in those programs plus the DPS "border/"local border" categories went from $219.5 million in 2012-13 to $94.1 million in 2014-15 -- indicating a drop of $128.1 million. Then again, the June 2013 summary also said "additional funding is provided" to DPS for border security above the $94.1 million total. Including that unspecified spending, the budget allocates more than $100 million to border security operations not spelled out in those estimates, we heard from a chief budget-writer and the staff of the board that advises lawmakers on spending issues Budget board staff spokesman John Barton told us via phone that by July 15, 2013, the board had estimated a total for border spending in all parts of DPS’ budget: $331.2 million in the 2014-15 budget. That total suggests an increase of $118.3 million over the agency’s revised 2012-13 border security budget total of $212.9 million. Vinger confirmed the amounts in the July 15 estimate were budgeted for DPS, offering no further comment. For another legislative perspective, we contacted a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee chairman Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands. Via email, Gary Scharrer asserted that as a committee member, Patrick would have known the wider scope of border spending and could have requested such numbers before his June campaign announcement. Scharrer said via email that according to Senate Finance Committee staff, border operations spending across all agencies in 2014-15 was $343.2 million, up $121.6 million from the previous budget. We weren’t able to learn what date that estimate was produced, but Scharrer said Patrick would have been aware that such spending was going into the budget. "He would have been in the loop on border security budget discussions," Scharrer said. Noting the Senate gave the budget act its final approval on May 25, Scharrer said, "The numbers were available" to Patrick. "Sen. Patrick could have checked with LBB or DPS for clarification – or verification – before going public. Many members fact-check ahead of time," Scharrer said, adding with a note of humor that they do so "to save themselves from PolitiFact sweeping in after them." As to budgeted money to battle criminal gangs, Barton told us DPS’s "organized crime" category was not the only state money spent to fight gangs. However, he said, the budget board did not have an estimate of such a 2014-15 total. Spence said he stood by the information he sent us. "People read those summaries and rely on those summaries as accurate data from the Legislative Budget Board," he said. Asked about the budget board staff’s July 15 estimate of $331.2 million border spending in DPS for 2014-15, Spence said, "I think there’s a disagreement about what is border security spending." Citing a couple of items mentioned in the July 15 estimate, Spence said, "A raise for troopers is not border security spending. Police academies and all those things... If the budget says ‘Border security spending is this,’ then members of the committee and members of the Senate are going to rely on that." Barton said all items in the estimate relate directly to border security. For instance, he said, the nearly $75 million in listed pay raises reflects money going to officers involved in border operations. Our ruling Patrick said the 2014-15 state budget written by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry "cut border security and funding to fight criminal gangs." Yet his cited figures drew from budget summaries that did not show all border spending. Budgeted border security funding in 2014-15 exceeds the total in the 2012-13 budget by about one third, while budgeted 2014-15 spending on battling gangs has yet to be fully calculated. It’s a PolitiFact principle not to hold people responsible for information that wasn’t available when they made their claims. In this instance, though, our sense is Patrick could at least have pinned down total border security funding before he spoke. The fact that anti-gang spending has still not been totaled leaves Patrick’s claim with a possible element of truth. We rate the full statement as Mostly False.

pomt-09849	The health care reform plan being proposed in Congress would mean "big tax increases."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/14/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-ad-says-health-reform-plan-wou/	The Campaign for Responsible Health Reform, sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a 30-second TV commercial that warns the health plans kicking around in Congress will translate to "big tax increases." With the visual of a red balloon expanding until it pops, the announcer says: "Washington's latest health reform idea: a trillion-dollar health plan, and a government-run public option, with big tax increases, even on health benefits. And the federal deficit? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the deficit will grow $239 billion. Inflated taxes. Swelling deficits. And expanded government control over your health. Tell Congress, 'Let's slow down and reform health care the right way.'" There's no denying the health care plans being considered in Congress would be expensive. In order to meet the plan's goal of reducing the number of uninsured, the government would be providing more in health care subsidies. That costs money. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the plan would cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years. But would it mean "big tax increases, even on health benefits?" The answer: It depends. There is not a single health care plan, there are several versions kicking around various committees in the House and Senate. And they have different approaches on how the plan would be paid for. Most of the discussion has focused on the the House plans because there is not a detailed Senate version yet. In the House plan, the tax increases are targeted at the wealthy. So if you make $1 million a year, yes, the plan would mean a big tax increase. We can be even more precise. The House versions of the bill would help pay for the health plan with a surtax on high earners that would break down as follows: for couples making between $350,000 and $500,000 (or $280,000 to $400,000 for individuals), a new 1 percent tax; between $500,000 and $1 million ($400,000 to $800,000 for individuals), 1.5 percent; and over $1 million (or over $800,000 for individuals), 5.4 percent. In other words, a family making $1 million would have to pay $9,000. Small businesses filing as individuals would face the same levies at those income levels. In all, that is estimated to bring in about $540 billion over 10 years. "That hits the very top earners," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "But that proposal would not affect many people." In fact, he said, less than 2 percent of the population fall into those income categories. But according to the Chamber, the high earners aren't the only ones who will see tax increases. In the House versions of the health plan, there's a tax penalty — anywhere from 2 percent to 8 percent on payroll taxes — for large companies that do not provide government-approved health care plans. There's also a tax penalty on uninsured people who refuse to buy insurance (that's the incentive to get everyone on some health plan). As for the Chamber of Commerce claim that the plans would even include taxes on health benefits, you need to go to the Senate side for that discussion. Although there's nothing currently in writing in a bill, the Senate Finance Committee is mulling a tax on so-called "Cadillac" or "gold-plated" health plans, plans that cost well above average. Essentially it would tax any amount paid for insurance plans over a certain threshold — perhaps $8,000 for an individual, or $21,000 for a family, said James Galfand, senior manager of health policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While it would not directly tax employees' health benefits, he said, it would amount to the same thing, as those costs would be passed on by the insurance company or employer. We think the Chamber of Commerce ad is a bit premature in warning that the health plan would include taxes on health benefits. It might, but so far, that's not in any published version of the bill, and the House specifically did not include it in its plan. The Chamber of Commerce ad does raise some legitimate concerns about how the health care plan would be paid for. But we think it's slightly misleading to say it would lead to "big tax increases." That's true for some high earners. But it's not true for the vast majority of people who do not make that level of income. Uninsured people who decline to purchase insurance will see a tax hit, but that's also expected to be a small minority. Things may change as these bills seek to solve the question of paying for the plan, but as the plans are now, some people would see a big tax increase, but most would not. That leaves us at a Half True.	None	U.S. Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2009-08-14T18:29:22	2009-08-12	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-14388	"The fact is voter fraud is rampant."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/	Greg Abbott took exception to President Barack Obama’s pokes about voter turnout and the governor followed up with a claim that, if supported, would arguably justify Texas Rangers manning polling stations. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, told Evan Smith, CEO of the Texas Tribune, that the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that "makes it harder for people to vote," perhaps referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in dozens of states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot (he didn’t specify). Obama otherwise called it important for conference participants to study ways of redesigning "our systems" to step up voter turnout. Then the Democratic leader said, to laughter, "the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate." Abbott, a Republican, told reporters three days later: "To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment." We’re separately checking his turnout tout. Abbott, the former longtime state attorney general, went on: "The fact is voter fraud is rampant--and in Texas, unlike some other states and unlike some other leaders, we are committed to cracking down on voter fraud." Rampant fraud? We wondered, especially because we’ve looked into identified instances, finding them rare. Abbott offers no backup Abbott didn’t respond to our request for elaboration. So we don’t know the basis of his "rampant" claim. But generally, the prevalence of voter fraud has widely been doubted. In 2013, for instance, a chart provided by then-AG Abbott showed 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That’s not a lot of fire but it was sufficient for us to find False a Democrat’s claim that studies had shown voter fraud to be non-existent in Texas. No surge, state records suggest After Abbott disagreed with Obama, we asked the Texas attorney general’s office for its latest breakdowns. Could there have been a fresh surge in fraud? Not according to the state documents, updated through February 2016. But we did learn of the 2015 case of Rosa Maria Ortega, charged with illegally voting in 2012 and 2014. A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Ortega for illegally voting in five Dallas County elections dating from 2005 through May 2014, according to a Nov. 9, 2015, Dallas Morning News account. The story said she’d allegedly registered to vote by swearing incorrectly that she was a citizen and it quoted Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County criminal district attorney, saying: "This is a big deal. People insist this kind of thing doesn’t happen, but it’s happening right here at home." According to the state's updated information, about 20 voting-related referrals to local prosecutors have occurred since 2014 including a few "illegal voting" matters such as the Ortega case. A conservative compendium Nationally, the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2015 posted a state-by-state breakdown of voter and election fraud convictions. Its Texas section walks through convictions reached against a dozen Texas residents from 2006 through 2015 for schemes ranging from vote-buying to impersonation fraud at the polls to, in a 2012 instance, trying to register to vote despite lacking citizenship. In 2015, most recently, Francisco "Frankie" Garcia, Rebecca Gonzalez, Diana Balderas Castaneda, and Guadalupe Escamilla were convicted of trying to buy votes in a Donna school board race with cocaine, cash, beer and cigarettes, the foundation says, with all four pleading guilty. Also in 2015, Hazel Woodard of Fort Worth pleaded guilty to impersonation fraud; Woodard had been a candidate for Democratic precinct chair who had her teenage son vote for her husband at the polls out of concern the elder Woodard wouldn’t make it to the polls, the foundation says. The gig was up, according to the foundation, after the dad showed up to vote after all. More rare than a lightning strike? Other resources indicate there’s not much there there. In 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University’s journalism school compiled a database that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records. According to the project’s website, the students included all cases "that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person." All told, News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database. A follow-up PolitiFact fact check, posted in August 2015, found that in Texas since 2002, there had been 85 election fraud prosecutions, not all resulting in convictions. Some perspective: From 2000 to 2014, per the Texas Secretary of State’s online record, about 72 million ballots were cast in Texas (and that’s not counting municipal and other local-only elections). In 2015, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said most of the Texas prosecutions would not have been prevented by the voter ID law. "There were a bunch of prosecutions for unlawfully turning in a ballot that people weren't supposed to have possession. There are a few instances of marking someone else's ballot without their consent — those are all absentee ballots. There are a few of fake registration, or of voting while ineligible — none of which are stopped by a rule requiring ID at the polls," Levitt said. "There are vanishingly few instances of voter fraud — incidents flat-out, not just prosecutions — that could be stopped by applying a rule requiring ID at the polls." Also in 2015, Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University political scientist professor who has testified as an expert on behalf of plaintiffs challenging the Texas voter ID law, pointed out 2012 court testimony by Major Forrest Mitchell, a criminal investigator with the Texas Attorney General’s office, in which Mitchell admitted that only about five of the more than 300 election fraud referrals that had been investigated since 2002 dealt with in-person voter impersonation. Mitchell’s testimony indicated that two of the cases could have been prevented by a voter ID law. Three people were prosecuted, though, since one case involved two people. According to an August 2014 analysis posted by the Washington Post, Levitt found only three credible allegations of fraud in Texas elections since 2000 which the state’s Republican-brought voter ID law was crafted to prevent. Separately, Minnite found four cases of this kind from 2000 until 2014. Four cases of fraud for 72 million votes cast suggests the incidence of Texas voter fraud was about 1 in 18 million. Plaintiff’s lawyer: ‘Not rampant’ While we didn’t hear more from Abbott, we did reach Jennifer Clark, a voting-rights lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which represents the Texas State Conference of the NAACP and the state’s Mexican American Legislative Caucus in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the Texas voter ID law. By phone, Clark told us that "under no definition of rampant is voter fraud rampant in Texas and the United States," though, she said, "that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen." Our ruling Abbott, defending the Texas mandate to present a photo ID at the polls, said: "Voter fraud is rampant." If Abbott has the goods on this, he’s keeping secrets. Best we can tell, in-person voter fraud--the kind targeted by the ID law--remains extremely rare, which makes this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06750	"When Social Security first started, there was 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are three workers for every retiree and soon there will be only two for every retiree."	true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/24/marco-rubio/reagan-library-speech-marco-rubio-takes-social-sec/	Freshman U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a highly anticipated and hyped address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Aug. 23, 2011, where Rubio continued his call for a smaller, fundamentally different and more conservative federal government. Rubio was invited to speak at the library at the personal invitation of former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and Rubio entered the library to deliver his remarks with her on his arm. He joked it was just the second person he'd walked down the aisle with -- the first being his wife Jeanette. (Rubio also helped Reagan up when she stumbled.) He addressed the crowd for more than 20 minutes, talking about his Cuban-immigrant roots, his experience coming of age during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, his belief in the American free enterprise system and his conviction that America can be both a prosperous and compassionate nation, according to the Los Angeles Times. Rubio also argued how both Democrats and Republicans created programs and levels of spending that -- while well intentioned -- were doomed to fail from the start. "You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and your future because you had to. "We took these things upon ourselves and our communities and our families and our homes and our churches and our synagogues. But all that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. All of the sudden, for an increasing number of people in our nation, it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the government's job. "For those who met misfortune, that wasn't our obligation to take care of them, that was the government's job. And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people in a way that undermined our ability to maintain our prosperity. "The other thing is that we built a government and its programs without any account whatsoever for how we were going to pay for it. There was not thought given into how this was going to be sustained. When Social Security first started, there was 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are only three for every retiree and soon there will only be two for every retiree. "Program after program was crafted without any thought as to how they will be funded in future years or the impact it would have on future Americans. They were done with the best of intentions, but because it weakened our people and didn't take account the simple math of not being able to spend more money than you have, it was destined to fail and brought us to the point at which we are at today." Rubio is suggesting that pre-government intervention with the creation of programs like Social Security and Medicare and welfare, people and private groups provided the same support. We're not going to attempt to check that fact, though we should note we're not necessarily agreeing to that point. According to the Social Security Administration, only about 15 percent of the labor force had any type of pension plan in 1932 and only about 5 percent of laborers actually received retirement benefits. During the height of the Great Depression over half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting, the federal government said. That out of the way, we wanted to check Rubio's example of the Social Security system, that the number of workers per retiree has dwindled from 16 to 1 when the program started to almost 2 to 1 today. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim made by U.S. Sen Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia. Experts they talked to said the best information comes from the Social Security Administration, the federal agency that administers the program. Social Security was created in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as part of his New Deal. The program has been amended several times over the years, which makes an apples-to-apples comparison somewhat problematic. But on regurgitating the data, Rubio is largely correct. The first set of Social Security Administration data comparing the ratio of workers to retirees comes from 1945 (the first benefits were not paid out until 1940). In 1945, there were almost 42 workers per retiree. In 1950, after changes to the program expanded coverage to an additional 10 million Americans and improved benefits, there were 16.5 workers for each Social Security recipient. That's the number Rubio is citing and is supported by experts. By 2011, the worker-to-retiree ratio had dropped to 2.9 to 1. The ratio is projected to continue to shrink, to 2.4 workers per retiree in 2022 and 2.2 workers per retiree in 2027. We should note the workers-per-retiree figure shrunk quickly following 1950. By 1955, the ratio was down to 8.6 workers per retiree. By 1965, the ratio was 4 workers per retiree. None of that speaks counter to Rubio's statement. In some ways, it illustrates the main problem with Social Security -- more and more money is going out in benefits and less and less money is coming in through payroll taxes. Rubio said, "When Social Security first started, there were 16 workers for every retiree. Today there are three workers for every retiree and soon there will be only two for every retiree." The official numbers from the Social Security Administration back him up. We rate this claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2011-08-24T15:59:17	2011-08-23	['None']
pomt-04243	Says that under the new healthcare law, full- and part-time workers will be required to buy insurance costing $375 to $1,000 a month, starting in 2014.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/18/county-line/county-line-restaurant-chain-says-full-and-part-ti/	Just before the November 2012 elections, employees of an Austin-based restaurant chain were warned the 2010 federal health care overhaul will cost them. An open letter; headlined "Health Insurance -- Starting in 2014," was tucked in with paychecks for employees of the County Line restaurants, according to an Austin Chronicle news article posted online Nov. 2. As of January 2014, the letter says, "YOU will be required to get and pay for health insurance. Your employer may help you but YOU will be legally required to buy health insurance." The letter continues: "How much will I have to pay? The best estimate from the Congressional Budget Office for the minimum level of health insurance coverage" when the law takes effect is $4,500 a year, or $375 a month, for individual coverage, and $12,000 a year, or $1,000 a month, for family coverage. Reader Sally Villarreal of Austin wrote us asking if the declared costs hold water. Under the law, many Americans will be required to have coverage as of 2014 or pay an income-tax penalty. But not every resident will directly pay the full costs. The law provides tax credits subsidizing purchases by people with lower incomes. Also, many full-time workers will not face the full tab. The County Line letter, for instance, says employees considered full time, or working more than 30 hours a week, would have half their individual premium costs covered by the chain. Under the law, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees must offer those employees an affordable plan or pay a penalty for not doing so. The letter does not say if the chain plans to offer part-time workers health-plan help, though it says such workers will have to get insured, regardless. As a result of the law, the letter says, "many of our employees will be restricted to working less than 30 hours a week." By telephone, Glen Garey, general counsel of the Texas Restaurant Association, who said he reviewed the letter before its distribution, told us he expects the law to cause restaurants to strive for a lid on full-time workers. The letter closes: "THIS IS THE LAW. It’s not a maybe. It is already happening." After noting that the Supreme Court has upheld the insurance mandate, the letter says: "The law could be repealed, but that would require a Republican president, and Republican majorities in the Senate and House... At this point, ‘Hope’ is not a strategy." That portion could have been read as a timely appeal to vote against President Barack Obama and Democrats who supported the law, which is often called Obamacare. Not so, County Line co-owner Skeeter Miller told us by telephone. Miller said the County Line, whose restaurants employ up to 1,000 people each year, distributed the notice because some workers incorrectly believed they were going to be getting free health care. So, will premiums cost $350 to $1,000 a month as the County Line says? Miller said he based the employee notice on a Jan. 11, 2010, letter from Douglas Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, to Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who had requested information on likely premiums for policies fulfilling the requirement that Americans get insured. The budget office letter says the agency’s cost estimates — for 2016, not 2014 — address Snowe’s question about the likely costs to obtain what are designated as minimal "Bronze" health plans, as opposed to more costly "Silver" plans providing greater coverage. "Overall, CBO estimates that premiums for Bronze plans purchased individually in 2016 would probably average between $4,500 and $5,000 for single policies and between $12,000 and $12,500 for family policies," Elmendorf wrote. Sure enough, those figures boil out to monthly costs of $375 to $417 for single policies and $1,000 to $1,042 for family policies, close to what the County Line told its workers. But the budget office figures were laid out with caveats, including that they do not reflect the subsidies available to lower-income Americans, the budget office letter says, and also "represent national averages; premiums for specific individuals would differ on the basis of their age, average spending on health care in their area of the country, and the specific plan they chose." By email, budget office spokeswoman Deborah Kilroe advised us the figures have not been updated. Separately, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, a health insurer, replied to our inquiries about the expected costs of coverage without specific forecasts. Blue Cross spokesman Ross Blackstone said by email: "We don't forecast costs like that because there are just too many variables that determine a person's premiums (type of policy, geographic region, utilization in that area, state reporting requirements, etc.)." For an insurance industry perspective, Jennifer Cawley of the Texas Association of Life and Health Insurers guided us to Robert Zirkelbach of the America’s Health Insurance Plans, a national trade association representing the health insurance industry. By telephone, Zirkelbach said the 2010 estimate remains the best available national forecast, but averages also don’t tell the full story. He said several factors--including the law’s minimum coverage requirement--to drive up premiums. "How much an individual or small business’s premiums will go up depends entirely on the amount of coverage someone has today," Zirkelbach said, meaning that if current coverage is especially minimal, the 2014 increase will likely be more substantial. Another variable, he said, would be the number of beneficiaries placed under each policy. Next, we noticed the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has widely studied U.S. health care, cites the budget office figures on its web page outlining the law’s mandate. Kaiser’s summary says premiums would vary by the age of people being insured. In 2010, it says, employees paid $899 on average toward the cost of individual coverage in an employer-based insurance plan and $3,997 for a family of four. That’s a lot less than the budget office cost estimates for 2016, but also solely reflects employee shares of premiums. Meantime, premium costs have gone up. According to a 2012 Kaiser survey of employer health benefits, annual premiums for family coverage cost $15,745 of late, with workers on average paying $4,316 toward those costs. Premiums for worker-only health coverage reached $5,615 annually, Kaiser said, with workers on average paying $951. Kaiser said the survey was conducted between January and May 2012 and included 3,326 randomly selected, non-federal public and private firms with three or more employees, 2,121 of which responded to the full survey. We asked Kaiser’s Gary Claxton, who oversaw the survey, to speak to the cost claim in the County Line’s notice. By telephone, Claxton suggested several flaws, including, he said, the implication that workers would be burdened with the full premium costs whereas employers would partially fund costs for full-time workers. Also, Claxton said, part-time workers might qualify for subsidies. Either way, he said, "the employee is not paying the whole thing." Carter Hobbs, a County Line employee who helped draft the employee notice, agreed by phone that the 2010 projections reflect full premium costs, not costs to employees alone. "How that cost is covered is a whole ‘nother discussion," Hobbs said. Our ruling The County Line letter to workers says full- and part-time workers will be required to buy health insurance in 2014 costing $375 to $1,000 a month. Those figures align with the budget office’s 2010 letter on what it would cost to purchase health insurance in 2016--not 2014. Also, those estimates did not attempt to calculate the effect of premium subsidies and were clearly presented as ballpark forecasts. Broadly, too, the County Line notice risks the misimpression that insurance costs would be borne by workers alone when results will not be that simple. We rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-12141	"There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/10/sebastian-gorka/no-obama-administration-didnt-invent-term-lone-wol/	Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, is none too fond of the terrorism-fighting approach of former President Barack Obama. He made this clear during an Aug. 8 interview on MSNBC. "There's no such thing as a lone wolf," Gorka said. "You do know that. That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid. There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida. At least through the ideology and the TTPs, the tactics, the training, the techniques and the procedures, that they supply through the internet. Never happened. It’s bogus." However, Gorka’s assertions are flawed, several terrorism experts told PolitiFact. (The White House did not provide any additional explanation in response to an inquiry.) The lone wolf as a metaphor for independent terrorism clearly pre-dated the Obama administration. We’ll also note that Gorka’s claim that there has "never" been a serious plot unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida is dubious. The term lone wolf 'was a phrase invented by the last administration' This is easily debunked. Just look at a few of the books that used the term in the context of terrorism before Obama took office in January 2009: • Brian T. Bennett, Understanding, Assessing, and Responding to Terrorism: Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Personnel, 2007: "Lone wolf terrorism involves individual extremists who usually operate alone or on the fringes of established extremist groups, inflicting serious harm or causing significant damage." • Jeffrey F. Addicott, Winning the War on Terror: Legal and Policy Lessons from the Past, 2002: "Because they operate on their own, without affiliation to any known group or state, individuals who engage in ‘lone-wolf terrorism’ are far harder to predict, track, or deter." • Linda Jacobs Altman, Hate and Racist Groups: A Hot Issue, 2001: "The lone wolf and leaderless cell became part of the new face of racist terrorism in the 1990s." In addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the definition of an "agent of a foreign power" to include a "lone wolf" category. The provision was widely known as the "lone wolf" amendment. So, how far back does the term go? Experts said that its specific application to terrorism originated with the ideas of white nationalist Louis Beam, who in the early 1980s advocated "leaderless resistance." Tom Metzger, the founder of the group White Aryan Resistance, advocated a similar approach. The idea "was adopted by American right-wing extremists in response to a federal law enforcement crackdown on domestic terrorists during the 1980s," said Mark Hamm, an Indiana State University criminologist who coauthored the book The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism. "Leaderless resistance is based on the idea that a terrorist group, no matter how secret or well-organized, simply cannot evade law enforcement, so terrorism is more readily accomplished by individual actors rather than a group." In 1998, FBI agents in San Diego opened "Operation Lone Wolf" -- an investigation into the criminal activities of a self-proclaimed white supremacist, Alex Curtis. The following year, a widely noted New York Times article was headlined, "New Face of Terror Crimes: 'Lone Wolf' Weaned on Hate." Over the next few years, the term became increasingly associated with terrorism of all stripes and was used by government officials, academics, and the media. "The reason was obvious: There were numerous sporadic terrorist attacks carried out by individuals and small groups," said George Michael, a criminologist at Westfield State University and author of Lone Wolf Terror and the Rise of Leaderless Resistance. "Furthermore, many of the perpetrators had little or no connections to terrorist movements." So while the term "lone wolf" was used increasingly during Obama’s presidency, its application to terrorism was already decades old, and it was not "invented" by the administration. 'There has never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida' Analyzing this statement requires a bit more nuance, so we won’t factor it into our rating. But the claim is still problematic, experts said. On the most basic level, there have been countless of terrorist attacks that have nothing to do with Islamic radicalism -- starting with the white nationalist movements that helped promulgate the term "lone wolf" in the first place. Other examples of terrorism, stemming from a variety of motives, include the 16 lethal bombings by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski between 1978 and 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, and the series of bombings by Olympic Games bomber Eric Rudolph between 1996 and 1998. Meanwhile, across the globe, "there are a range of attacks by lone perpetrators that are tied to ethnic rather than religious causes, and not all were Islamic by a long shot," said Jeffrey Kaplan, a terrorism specialist who is starting a posting at King Fahd Defense College in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and who co-authored the book, Lone Wolf and Autonomous Cell Terrorism. Even limiting the universe to post 9/11 attacks with Muslim perpetrators produces some exceptions to Gorka’s firm "never," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. He cited two attacks without apparent links to al-Qaida or ISIS: • On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but that he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. • On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself "a Muslim American, angry at Israel" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but "acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization." The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. Gartenstein-Ross said he’s sympathetic to Gorka’s broader skepticism about the impact of lone wolves. For starters, there is evidence from a recent University of Miami study that online pro-ISIS groups have highly fluid memberships, suggesting that true lone wolves -- people acting genuinely on their own without any interactions with like-minded individuals, online or otherwise -- are rare in the Internet age. Experts have cautioned that overuse of the term "lone wolf" may even be hampering investigations. "When you systematically describe attackers as lone wolves, you sometimes end up missing the networks they were connected to," Gartenstein-Ross said. Our ruling Gorka said, "There's no such thing as a lone wolf. ... That was a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid." Contrary to what Gorka said, the concept of the lone wolf terrorist predates the Obama administration by decades. We found the term widely used by government officials, academics, and the media, all before Obama took office. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05180	When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/14/barack-obama/obama-attacks-romney-over-40000-lost-manufacturing/	In the presidential campaign, the TV ads have been a battle of numbers. The latest come from President Barack Obama, who highlighted Mitt Romney’s job record in a advertisement airing in New Hampshire and around the country titled, "We’ve heard it all before." "When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts lost 40,000 manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to 47th in job creation, fourth from the bottom," Obama claims. PolitiFact has addressed both parts before and rated them both Half True. In checking Obama’s claim about manufacturing jobs under Romney, PolitiFact National turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data, and examined state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney’s tenure -- from January 2003 to January 2007. Over that period, Massachusetts manufacturing jobs declined from 336,000 to 298,200 -- a difference of 38,000 jobs. So It’s not 40,000, but it’s close. As for the second part of the claim -- the rate of decrease -- Massachusetts manufacturing jobs fell by 11.3 percent over the four-year period. The drop for the nation was 5.8 percent. That means the Massachusetts decline was nearly twice that of the nation, as the ad claimed. So the Obama campaign is right about the manufacturing jobs numbers. But it's worth pointing out that the numbers before and after Romney’s term reveal that the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument. As for the part about job creation, Obama adviser David Axelrod recently threw out the same "47th-in-job-creation" claim on CBS’ "Face the Nation" and scored a Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact National used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looking at figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. Since the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, PolitiFact used the data for December of each year as a baseline. From December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth, calculated by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states. Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So, the numbers check out again. But in rating claims like these, PolitiFact also interviews experts about how much the target of the attack deserves blame for the numbers. And quite often, experts say it's a stretch to blame a governor for the complex things that happen in a state economy. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. "The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) There are lots of ways to present jobs data. And the statistics can often be manipulated so that competing campaigns can make equal and opposite conclusions. The Romney campaign also has put its own twist on jobs creation data, pointing to figures that show Massachusetts' percentage of job growth improving from 49th out of 50 during 2003 to 36th during 2006. The campaign has noted that Massachusetts added more than 47,000 jobs over the course of his administration--a gross number that fails to factor in job losses during Romney’s time as governor. Our ruling Obama used accurate figures for the number and rate of manufacturing job losses in Massachusetts under Romney. He also gives the correct ranking for Massachusetts’ job creation during Romney’s tenure. But Obama exaggerated Romney’s impact on the Bay State job market, an impact that experts stress is minor at best. Also, it's important to note that the the manufacturing job loss under Romney (11.3 percent) was slower than it was in either the previous four-year period (16.7 percent) or the successive four-year period (15.1 percent). This weakens the Obama campaign’s argument. So just as PolitiFact did with the individual claims, we rate this version Half True.

pomt-13491	Says Donald Trump is "on record extensively supporting (the) intervention in Libya."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-trump-supported-intervention-libya/	When it comes to national security, Republican Donald Trump casts Democrat Hillary Clinton as too ready to take the country into war. One of his prime examples -- Clinton’s full-throated support for the attacks that toppled Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. But in a NBC News forum focused on the role of the commander-in-chief, Clinton deflected that criticism. She said there was no difference between herself and Trump on the Libyan action. "He's on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population," Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016. Did Trump endorse the attacks to unseat Libya’s then-leader, Moammar Gadhafi? The record shows he did. Early in 2011, before the United States joined a NATO force to oust Gadhafi, Trump argued for American action. We know what Trump thought back then thanks to a video on Trump’s own video blog (credit to BuzzFeed for spotting it) "I can’t believe what our country is doing," Trump said, according to the BuzzFeed transcript. "Gadhafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around. We have soldiers all over the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage." Trump continued. "You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst," he said. "Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before." And then ... "But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals," Trump said. "It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives." Trump offered a more mixed assessment on CNN after the attacks began. His primary concern was with the political leanings of the forces opposing Gadhafi. "I do really want to know who these people we're fighting for, who they are," Trump said on March 28, 2011. "I hear they are aligned with Iran. I hear they may be aligned with al-Qaida." But Trump still said, "At this point, if you don't get rid of Gadhafi, it's a major, major black eye for this country." Our ruling Clinton said Trump is on record "extensively" supporting the attacks that unseated Libya’s Gadhafi. We actually didn’t find that many comments from Trump about Libya. But when he did speak, he was emphatic. In 2011, before the first bombing runs, Trump said, "We should go in, we should stop this guy." Even when he voiced concern over who would run Libya post-Gadhafi, he supported the intervention.

pomt-00782	"Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-half-americans-have-less-10000/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, speaking in Austin, bemoaned widening income differences between the country’s very rich and the rest of us. And in his remarks at a South Austin union hall, the Vermont independent mulling a run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination also warned about American failures to save money. "Here’s something not talked about, something that can make us all very, very nervous," Sanders said. "Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account. "And you know what that means and you know why people are so stressed out? If you have less than $10,000," he said, "that means an automobile accident, a divorce, a serious illness, a crisis of one kind or another can drive you into bankruptcy and financial disaster." Is he right that half of us have less than $10K in savings? Sanders’ backup To our inquiry, a Sanders spokesman, Jeff Franks, said by email that Sanders relied on an April 2014 USA Today news story quoting a survey indicating 52 percent of U.S. workers had said they had less than $10,000 in total savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement. It did not include their homes or defined benefit plans, such as traditional pensions that could be used for retirement Specifically, the story said, 36 percent of workers said they had less than $1,000 in such savings and investments with another 16 percent of workers reporting $1,000 to $9,999 in such savings and investments. Those results came from a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates. Next, we spotted a chart on the institute’s website drawn from the same 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey. The 52 percent of workers reporting less than $10,000 in savings and investments in 2014 is up from 39 percent in 2009, the chart shows. Of course, "workers" isn’t all of us. We called the Washington, D.C.-based institute, which says it was founded in 1978 to deliver unbiased information on employee benefit plans "so that decisions affecting the system may be made based on verifiable facts." By phone, researcher Craig Copeland told us that overall, 51 percent of survey respondents, meaning retirees and others, had less than $10,000 in financial savings. Also by phone, Ruth Helman of Greenwald and Associates, which helped do the survey, paused at the senator’s wording. "Strictly speaking, ‘their savings account’ isn’t correct. It’s total savings wherever it may be, under the mattress or wherever," Helman said. Federal Reserve Bank We wondered if there were other ways of looking at savings. Several experts urged us to contact the Federal Reserve Bank, which conducts a survey focused on consumer finances every three years. Its latest survey, drawing on data collected in 2013, resulted in a chart pointed out by Copeland indicating that the median value of financial savings outside of a pension or home reported by the nearly 95 percent of families who had bank accounts or stocks, bonds and other financial assets that year was $21,200, down from $23,000 in the board’s 2010 survey. SOURCE: Report, "Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September 2014 Copeland said that given that more than 5 percent of families reported no such financial assets, it’s reasonable to speculate that families overall had median financial savings of less than $20,000. We also asked reserve board officials to analyze the senator’s "savings accounts" statement. By phone, William Emmons and Bryan Noeth, both employed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, raised questions. For instance, why not count a family’s home or pension as part of its savings? Reminder: The institute, with its focus on savings for retirement, set aside these asset categories. Emmons said: "People do count on their housing equity, not only in retirement, but before that." Beyond that, the pair said, it’s not always meaningful to focus on money held in "savings accounts," which are a single wealth indicator. "A savings account isn’t where everybody holds their money," Noeth said. The two said a potentially superior way to gauge how Americans are faring, savings-wise, would be to consider net worth meaning family assets compared to debts. An agency manager, Adriene Dempsey, emailed us a spreadsheet showing that according to the board’s 2013 survey, 26 percent of U.S. families had less than $10,000 in net worth--a tick worse than the 25 percent of families according to its 2010 study. In 2013, half of American families had about $81,500 in net wealth or more, according to the spreadsheet. Total assets for a family include financial assets, such as bank accounts, mutual funds and securities plus tangible assets, including real estate, vehicles and durable goods, according to a February 2015 essay by the St. Louis Fed. We’ve elaborated on this here. So by the net-worth metric, more families are better off than if one focused on financial savings alone. We ran this "net worth" angle past the institute’s Coleman, who reminded by email that its survey (relied on by Sanders) took into account financial assets, not just savings accounts. Our ruling Sanders said: "Half of all Americans have less than $10,000 in their savings account." Some clarification went missing here: A 2014 survey indicated about half of American adults had less than $10,000 in savings and investments, such as a 401(k) or IRA, that could be used for retirement; those results encompassed more than savings accounts.

pomt-08332	Stabilizing the recent financial crisis "will cost less than 1 percent of GDP," which is less than the 2.5 percent to fix the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-current-financial-recovery-has-b/	During his Oct. 27, 2010, interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, President Barack Obama defended the actions taken by the federal government to stabilize the financial crisis -- the source of much voter unhappiness on the campaign trail this year. Obama said, "If you look at how we have handled this financial crisis -- if you had told me two years ago that we're going to be able to stabilize the system, stabilize the stock market, stabilize the economy, and by the way, at the end of this thing, it will cost less than 1 percent of GDP, where the (1980s savings and loan) crisis cost us 2.5 percent of our entire economy -- a much smaller crisis -- I'd say, 'We'll take that,' because we saved taxpayers a whole lot of money." That's a striking comparison, so we immediately thought it deserved a fact-check. After a bit of research, we located the federal report that made that exact comparison. It was an October 2010 document from the Treasury Department titled, "Troubled Asset Relief Program: A Two Year Retrospective." The TARP, as the program is more commonly known, was created under President George W. Bush in the fall of 2008 to head off what policymakers and business leaders feared was a serious threat to the stability of the nation's financial system. Initially, independent observers projected that TARP would cost $350 billion or more, but the October 2010 report estimates that the total cost for TARP and related programs will be far lower -- about $29 billion. "We currently expect that the overall direct fiscal cost of all our financial interventions will be less than 1 percent of GDP," the report said. Using the $29 billion figure would easily make the 1 percent cutoff, since GDP for 2009 was just over $14 trillion. For the purpose of context, the report adds that "this result is notable compared to past systemic financial crises. An International Monetary Fund study found that the average net fiscal cost of resolving roughly 40 banking crises since 1970 was 13 percent of GDP. And according to the Government Accountability Office, the net fiscal cost of cleaning up the U.S. savings and loan crisis was 2.4 percent of GDP." We located the original IMF study cited in the Treasury report and found that it offers two estimates, using different methodology, of the pricetag for the savings and loan crisis, which occurred when thrifts, under lax regulation, made a series of risky investments that eventually turned bad and left depositors holding the bag. One estimate in the IMF report is 2.4 percent, which is very close to what Obama said. The other is 3.2 percent. Since Obama was satisfied with the lower cost estimate -- which wouldn't be in his interest in making this kind of comparison -- then we'll stipulate to using that estimate. So, Obama can point to a credible source for his statistical comparison. But we still think it's worth a closer look at the context behind the comparison. Here are two broad issues that we think are important to keep in mind: • The 1 percent may not include all costs. The Treasury report includes the cost of TARP outlays to support banks, carmakers and the housing sector, as well as TARP and Treasury Department funds used to shore up the troubled insurer AIG. However, it acknowledges several other types of outlays that are not included in its calculations, and adding in these costs would increase the total burden. "Outside of TARP, we expect to incur substantial losses from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs), through capital injections from Treasury to the GSEs through the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements," the report says. The report adds that some of these additional losses would be made up by gains elsewhere. One source of expected income stems from authority provided by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, under which Treasury purchased more than $200 billion in mortgage‐backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs. "Those investments are generating notable returns," the report said. "In addition, as a result of its emergency financial programs, remittances from Federal Reserve operations to the Federal Budget have increased sharply in 2009 and 2010, and they are projected to remain elevated for some time. While considerable uncertainty remains, revenues from these two sources will significantly offset to likely losses elsewhere." Also not included in the cost is the added deposit insurance payments under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The widely popular decision to increase the level of assets protected by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 means that taxpayers are now on the hook for greater payouts when banks fail. And unlike during the S&L crisis, the behind-the-scenes role of the Federal Reserve has been huge in the post-2008 recovery. After the 2008 crisis, the Fed acted in a variety of ways to stabilize various financial markets -- securing loans, for instance, or making implicit guarantees of purchases. This amounted to a "shadow budget," says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- that is, one that's not officially on the books but which has consequences elsewhere in the economy. Meanwhile, the report acknowledges additional, intangible costs to the financial crisis that are hard to factor into any calculation. "Our estimates do not reflect the full economic and fiscal costs of this crisis," the report said, "whether measured in the millions of Americans still searching for work, the lost income for business, or the impact of the recession on federal and state budgets." Indeed, one obvious exclusion is that the Treasury report doesn't count the cost of the economic stimulus bill, originally estimated at $787 billion. On one level, that may be wise, since it's a cleaner way to compare the current recovery efforts to the S&L debacle, given that the earlier episode was essentially a banking crisis, not an economy-wide crisis. On the other hand, the president's statement -- which included the words "stabilize the economy" -- seems to suggest a broader interpretation that includes the cost of the stimulus. Put all of this together and you have a lot of different ways to calculate the numbers. "There are so many variables on either side that it's impossible to say whether you can really compare the costs" of the two episodes, said Kathleen Day, a former journalist and author of S&L Hell: The People and the Politics Behinid the $1 Trillion Savings and Loan Scandal. While we think the statistic Obama used is legitimate, it's more the start of the argument than the end of it. And it omits a number of costs that reasonable people might think should be included. • The figure Obama cited is a snapshot in time, but the costs are not over yet. To take but one example: The Treasury estimate relies on the assumption that the value of the federal government's investments -- which are effectively keeping down the TARP's cost -- remain stable rather than declining. "We expect that TARP investments in the banks and the credit market programs will be profitable," the report says. "The recently announced restructuring of AIG will accelerate the government’s exit on terms that are likely to lead to an overall profit on the government’s support for AIG, including the value of Treasury’s interests in AIG held outside of TARP." That may turn out to be true -- but it also may not. And if it doesn't, taxpayers could be on the hook for higher costs. In fact, if Obama had made the comparison much earlier in the crisis, the federal government would have been on the hook "for a potentially enormous bill," said Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in business and finance. "It is fortunate that the ultimate bill will probably turn out to be much lower than the worst-case-scenario." By the same token, he said, troubles in the housing market could increase the cost of recovery efforts within another year or two. "In my opinion, it is far too early to conclude that we have successfully contained and resolved the financial crisis." So where does this leave us? Obama has repeated a defensible estimate of the cost of the two financial crises. But there are lots of other estimates that would be equally if not more valid, and those wouldn't be as favorable to the White House's case. The figures Obama cited don't include many of the ancillary (and often intangible) costs of the recovery, and there's no way of knowing for sure that current cost estimates won't go up in future years.

pomt-09051	"West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/01/ron-klein/klein-lumps-all-wests-donors-together/	Democratic Congressman Ron Klein has gone on the offensive in his campaign against Republican retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West -- whose $2 million war chest and national media attention have turned the race into one of the hottest Congressional contests in Florida. Klein represents a swing Congressional district that spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties. Klein wants to capitalize on voters' anger about the BP spill and hammers West in a June 28 fundraising e-mail. The bulk of his e-mail with the subject line "Apologize to BP?!" relates to West's stance on the oil spill and his connection to Congressman Joe Barton, the Texas Republican facing heat after apologizing to BP and calling Obama's demand for the escrow account a "shakedown." "In short, while sheets of oil are washing up today on Pensacola Beach, he’s more concerned with BP’s profits than the livelihood of fishermen, restaurateurs, or those that depend on FL tourism...," Klein wrote about his opponent West. "Barton called the Obama administration’s push for BP to set up a $20 billion account - a fund that would ultimately help pay for clean up and damages and wages for those who are losing their livelihood - a 'shakedown.' Most Republicans have made it very clear that Barton’s actions were unacceptable. Not Allen West. A continuing supporter of offshore drilling, West’s campaign is now aligned with those who would apparently give BP a pass. Thus far, the most radical Tea Partiers have taken a liking to West and what he stands for. They also haven’t been shy in contributing to his cause. West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign." There are a lot of strong statements in Klein's letter that we could have chosen to fact-check. But we particularly thought that last sentence was a biting claim, and we don't mean the usual spelling of "free rein." Note Klein didn't say that West would ruin Florida's beaches, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free rein -- he said that $2 million in donations to West came from donors who held those views. For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether "West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare, and give corporations free reign." We contacted Klein's campaign and asked for documentation to support their claim. Campaign spokeswoman Sarah Rothschild sent us about two dozen citations for news articles and web sites that relate to West and his donors, but she declined to define what Klein meant by "give corporations free reign." We looked at most of their citations, focusing on BP and Rep. Joe Barton since that was the point of Klein's e-mail, and we break the other donors down by topic below. First, we confirmed that West had raised $2,065,855 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. It's not logical to assume that every one those donors would ruin the beaches and end Medicare and Social Security. We found a few tenuous connections to those issues among a small handful of donors but not enough for a blanket statement. Congressman Joe Barton West got $1,000 from Rep. Joe Barton's Texas Freedom Fund PAC on March 3, 2010, FEC reports show. On June 17 at a Congressional hearing on BP, Barton, the ranking member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, defended BP. The Wasington Post's Right Now blog reported that Barton said: "It is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown." Later the same day, Barton apologized for his apology after Republican leaders threatened to take away his committee leadership position. The Tampa Tribune reported June 25 that West about a week earlier had also raised concerns about the BP escrow account at a business luncheon in Palm Beach Gardens. "West said that while he was 'angry with BP' for the spill, 'when you have an executive branch that goes to a private sector business and takes their private equity funds and demands that they put it into an escrow account, something is upside down in this country. That is a very dangerous precedent that we establish.'" Even though West may not like the way the restitution happened, the Freedom Fund donation came about a month before the Gulf oil well blowout. So we moved on to the other citations Klein's camp sent us. Oil and gas, banks The CRP analysis showed -- and West doesn't dispute -- that by June 29 he had received about $6,850 from donors identified as being in the oil and gas industry. But we could not find any donations in this race from BP, or even Exxon, the company involved in the 1989 major Alaskan oil spill. (As an aside, we'll note the records show that Klein received $1,000 from BP in 2006 and $500 in 2008.) CRP showed that by the same date, West had received $8,600 from donors identified as Bank of America. Klein's campaign cites lavish Super Bowl parties and financial shenanigans by Bank of America, but no connection to beaches, Medicare or Social Security or giving corporations free rein. The PACs Next, we looked at political action committees, some of them set up by controversial public officials: West got $2,500 from the PAC of an insurance company called Torchmark, according to the FEC report. The American Association of Justice in 2008 listed the company in its "10 Worst Insurance Companies in America" for what it said were transgressions, but again, nothing there about beaches, Medicare, Social Security or free rein. West got $5,000 in March 2010 from Rep. Paul Ryan's Prosperity PAC, FEC reports show, and Ryan is the congressman whose budget proposal, A Roadmap to America's Future, was described in The Atlantic Feb. 2 as "essentially privatized Social Security and strangled Medicare inflation with cost-controlled vouchers." There, finally, is a link to Klein's claim about support for deep cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Next up was former House Majority Leader Dick Armey's FreedomWorks PAC, which stands for "lower taxes, less government, more freedom." The PAC hosted a fundraiser for West March 22 and named him as one of its Champions of Freedom. Though Klein didn't cite an amount, we found FEC reports that show FreedomWorks made $841 in in-kind contributions to the West campaign in March and April 2010. In an interview on Meet the Press, Armey called Medicare "tyranny" because seniors are forced to participate, according to an Aug. 16, 2009, article in Politico. On its website, FreedomWorks is critical of Social Security. Armey was also critical of the $20 billion BP escrow fund, according to a June 17, 2010, post in Right Now, the Washington Post blog. "I'm against it -- there is no doubt that BP has resititution to make, but there is something called due process through the legitimate judicial branch of government through which these things should be adjudicated." So Armey or his PAC are highly critical of Social Security and Medicare -- part of Klein's claim -- and Armey was also critical of the creation of the BP escrow fund, though that doesn't mean he would leave our beaches in ruins. Last, we checked Sarah Palin's PAC, which gave West $1,000 in March, FEC records show. On June 20, 2010, Sarah Palin tweeted, “Gulf disaster needs divine intervention as man’s efforts have been futile. Gulf lawmakers designate today Day of Prayer for solution/miracle.” Klein's campaign also cited a June 12, 2010, Fox News report in which she blamed lax government regulations for the spill. Thouugh she criticized the Obama administration's response and "extreme environmentalists" we don't think that means Palin wants to leave our beaches in ruin. We also don't think Palin would call for praying for a miracle after clean-up efforts failed if she wanted the beaches destroyed. And blaming "lax government regulations" doesn't sound like she wants to give the oil companies free rein. Clearly, West has taken money from at least a few donors that have either been sympathetic to BP, in favor of massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare or affiliated with corporations that have been accused of wrongdoing. But that's not what Klein's campaign said. Klein's fundraising e-mail said: "West has raised $2 million from those that would leave our beaches in ruins, end Social Security and Medicare and give corporations free reign." The donors the Klein campaign cited added up to about $25,000 -- only a sliver of his $2 million campaign. The West campaign could cherrypick too and likely find negative headlines about some of Klein's donors -- including BP in previous election cycles. But we don't think that we can draw conclusions about all of Klein's donors based on his BP donations. Similarily, there is no way Klein would know the viewpoints of all of West's donors unless he researched all of their views on these topics -- an impossible endeavor. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09924	Under the "Cash for Clunkers" program, "all we've got to do is ... go to a local junkyard, all you've got to do is tow it to your house. And you're going to get $4,500."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/22/sean-hannity/hannity-claims-loophole-cash-clunkers-program-woul/	On his Fox News Channel program on June 18, 2009, political commentator Sean Hannity mocked the "Cash for Clunkers" program recently approved by Congress, saying a loophole would allow someone to buy an old heap at a junkyard, have it towed to his or her house, and the government would pay $4,500 for it. The Cash for Clunkers program is actually called the "Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009." Having passed the House and Senate, it now sits on the president's desk awaiting his signature. Under the program, people can get $3,500 to $4,500 if they trade in their old gas-guzzler for a more fuel-efficient new car. The idea is to boost the ailing auto industry while improving the environment. There are lots of eligibility rules, and you can read all about them here in a Web site created by the government. The bill provides $1 billion for the program from July through November. In an interview with Hannity, Sen. John McCain criticized the program as more "out-of-control spending" by the Obama administration. Hannity then added his claim about how it would be easy to game the system to soak the government. "Listen, all we've got to do is you got to go to a local junkyard — all you've got to do is tow (the car) to your house. And you're going to get $4,500," Hannity said. "I'm going to go do that." Actually, legislators anticipated just such a scheme and included provisions to prevent it. First, the law requires that the vehicle must be in "drivable condition." So if it needs to be towed to your house, no dice. And second, the trade-in has to have been "continuously insured consistent with the applicable state law and registered to the same owner for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to such trade-in." In English: You have to have owned the car for a year, and you have to be able to prove it. Those safeguards were written into the bill to safeguard against the very scenario Hannity described, said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hannity's statement is "not accurate," he said. You could always lie and forge documents. (Don't do it, Sean!) But that would be fraud. And the bill says anyone who knowingly violates the provisions of the program could face a fine of up to $15,000. The wording in the legislation makes this one an easy call for us. The bill is written to prohibit the very scenario Hannity describes as possible. His statement goes on the junk heap. We rule it False.

pomt-15062	Says Ronald Reagan "reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/25/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-brings-ronald-reagans-tax-raising-/	Stephen Colbert has interviewed a slew of presidential candidates in the first weeks of his new job hosting CBS’ The Late Show, including Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. His time with Cruz on Sept. 21 stood out for a fact-filled back and forth about a major Republican role model, President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz if he could agree with Reagan’s support of amnesty for undocumented immigrants and record of raising taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said "of course not" before pivoting to Reagan’s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he "signed the largest tax cut in history" and spurred economic growth. "You know, when Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012," Cruz said. Colbert jumped in, saying "But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it’s a matter of compromising." PolitiFact explored Cruz’s point about economic growth in another fact-check. We wondered if Colbert’s retort was on the money or overstated. (It’s our first fact-check of Colbert in his new role — and the first one in five years, period.) Did Reagan really shift course on tax cuts when the growth stopped? A CBS press contact did not return an email for comment. Reagan’s tax cut As Cruz said, the Gipper really did cut taxes — with the help of Congress — in his first year as president. The "largest tax cut in history" that Cruz mentioned is in reference to the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, a $38 billion phased-in cut ($99 billion in 2015 dollars). Put in the way that economists prefer to discuss tax cuts, it represented 1.91 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. This law included across-the-board cuts of about 30 percent to statutory income tax rates. As Colbert said, Reagan raised taxes, too. Two laws, one in 1982 and another in 1984, were especially dramatic. These laws generally raised taxes by removing tax loopholes, not by raising the tax rate, said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Still, Baker said, "the loopholes were big ones." Reagan’s tax increases 1982: The most significant tax increase Reagan signed was also the first. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (yes, another law with a very sexy name) increased taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP. The 1982 tax increase was "probably the largest peacetime tax increase in American history," said economist Bruce Bartlett, who advised Reagan on domestic policy and then worked as Treasury deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the George H.W. Bush administration. (An analysis by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, agrees.) This law was driven by pressure to attack the federal budget deficit, as well as the impression that Reagan’s tax-cutting was partially responsible for lower-than-expected tax revenues. Bartlett, who reviewed Reagan’s tax record for Tax Notes in 2011, cited a Treasury estimate that the 1982 law raised taxes by almost 1 percent of GDP, or about $150 billion in modern dollars. Specifically, it rolled back some but not all of the 1981 tax cut for writing off equipment, and it repealed 1981 "safe harbor" leasing provisions, said Stephen J. Entin, senior fellow at the Tax Foundation and former deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the Reagan administration. 1983: A law Reagan signed in 1983 aimed to keep Social Security afloat by increasing payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some high-earners. This cost $24.6 billion, or almost $50 billion in 2015 dollars, through 1988, according to an administration estimate. 1984: The Deficit Reduction Act that Reagan signed rolled back part of the 1981 cut on buildings, Entin said, with the idea that Congress would enact spending cuts. "But many of those cuts were either never enacted or were later restored," Entin said. This led to $25 billion in tax receipts. Reagan also signed tax increases in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 (as well as a couple other laws with revenue reductions). So where does that leave Reagan’s tax record on the whole? It’s mixed. On one hand, revenues were lower as a share of GDP in his last year in office (17.6 percent of GDP in 1988) compared to the year before he took office (18.5 percent of GDP in 1980), according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. However, the thrust of the 1981 tax cut that Cruz touted on Colbert’s show didn’t prove to have lasting effects on the whole. A 2006 Treasury Department analysis offers another view of the plunge after the 1981 law and the subsequent changes that wound it back. Reagan’s staff tallied up the effect of major legislation on tax receipts over his tenure for his final budget proposal (page 4-4). The 1981 tax cuts comprised most of the total $275 billion in tax relief, but the other side of the ledger listed $133 billion in cumulative tax increases. "Thus, Reagan took back about half the 1981 tax cut with subsequent tax increases," Bartlett wrote. Our ruling Responding to Cruz’s assertion that Reagan "signed the largest tax cut in history," Colbert said he "reversed" it and "raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations." Legislation that Reagan signed over his time in office and raised taxes did not completely reverse the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. But the broader point Colbert makes is on point. Reagan agreed to raise taxes to deal with budget deficits, even if he wasn’t enthusiastic about it. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13236	Colorado saw "increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people" and "increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana" following the legalization of recreational pot.	half-true	/california/statements/2016/oct/19/scott-jones/hazy-data-make-colorado-marijuana-claim-half-true/	Asked about California’s effort to legalize recreational marijuana, Republican congressional candidate Scott Jones said the experiences in Colorado are a stark warning of what not to do. Jones is Sacramento County’s sheriff and is running against Democratic Rep. Ami Bera for the region’s 7th District Congressional seat. "We can look to Colorado ... and look at the horrific results," Jones said during a debate this week between the two candidates in Sacramento. "If you look at the increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people. If you look at the increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana. All voters have to do is see what happened in Colorado to predict what’s going to happen here." Scott Jones makes his claim about marijuana at about the 10:20 minute mark in the video above. California voters in November will decide on Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational pot for those 21 and older. Both Jones and Bera oppose the measure. Several other states will also vote on legalizing recreational or medicinal marijuana on Election Day. Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in 2012 and the law went into effect in 2014. We wondered if Jones was right? Did Colorado see a spike in ER trips by young people and more cases of driving while stoned after it legalized pot? Our research The first part of Jones’ statement appears to be correct. Several studies document a rise in trips to Colorado emergency rooms by young people. As reported in the Denver Post in July, a study in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics found "Colorado’s laws on labeling and child-resistant packaging have been unable to stop an increase of young kids ending up in the emergency room after accidentally consuming marijuana." The study found "... cases for pediatric marijuana increased significantly and at a higher rate than the rest of the United States." Examining Jones’ claim about an increase in incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana was more complex. There’s not much data yet on the topic because the state only started tracking marijuana-related traffic incidents in 2014, according to a Colorado State Patrol spokesman quoted in the Denver Post last year. Jones’ campaign manager pointed us to a Colorado State Patrol report showing mixed results. It says the percentage of DUIs in the state where marijuana or marijuana in combination with alcohol or other drugs was the perceived impairing substance increased from 12 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015. The same report, however, shows the raw number of citations for DUIs involving marijuana or marijuana in combination with other drugs dropped slightly during the same two years, from 674 to 665. A separate Colorado study pointed to by Jones’ campaign reported there’s been an increase in the percentage of drivers testing positive for marijuana involved in fatal traffic accidents. Making things more cloudy, however, that report includes a note from the Colorado State Patrol that "marijuana citations" are defined as those where marijuana was present "based on officer opinion only," noting there’s "no toxicological confirmation." Radley Balko, who blogs about criminal justice for the Washington Post, wrote in 2014 that a spike in the number of drivers who are tested and found to have traces of marijuana in their system would not be a surprise in Colorado, nor would it mean marijuana necessarily contributed to a traffic accident. "All that a positive test tells us is that the driver has smoked pot at some point in the past few days or weeks," Balko wrote, noting the drug can linger in a person’s system for days after its effects wear off. "It makes sense that loosening restrictions on pot would result in a higher percentage of drivers involved in fatal traffic accidents having smoked the drug at some point over the past few days or weeks," Balko added. Our ruling Scott Jones said Colorado saw "increased incidents of emergency room visits by young people" and "increased incidents of driving while under the influence of marijuana" following the state’s legalization of recreational marijuana. Studies show the state indeed experienced a spike in ER visits by young people related to marijuana. Less clear is how marijuana-related traffic incidents have changed since the state legalized the drug. Studies have limited data and show mixed results. Further complicating the matter, marijuana can remain in a driver’s system days after the effect of the drug has worn off, making it difficult to determine whether the drug was the primary factor in an accident. Jones’ statement on the ER visits is accurate. But there’s not enough convincing data to prove the second portion of his claim. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-10132	Barack Obama opposed a bill that would have saved Gianna Jessen's life.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/bornalivetruth-org/abortion-survivor-would-have-been-protected-under-/	An ad from an independent advocacy group, BornAliveTruth.org, criticizes Barack Obama's votes on abortion when he was a state senator in Illinois. The ad shows a young woman, Gianna Jessen, looking directly at the camera and saying the following: "Can you imagine not giving babies their basic human rights, no matter how they entered our world? My name's Gianna Jessen, born 31 years ago after a failed abortion. But if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here. Four times Barack Obama voted to oppose a law to protect babies left to die after failed abortions. Senator Obama, please support born alive infant protections. I'm living proof these babies have a right to live." View the ad here . The ad refers to Illinois legislation put forward in 2001, 2002 and 2003 by opponents of abortion. The intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse, Jill Stanek, who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms. Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care. Obama did vote against the laws, by voting no or present on the bills. (In Illinois, a present vote has the same weight as a no vote.) But because of the older law, Jessen is wrong when she says "if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here." According to the medical records provided by the organization that produced the ad, Jessen was born at 29 weeks, which would have been a viable pregnancy and subject to the older Illinois law requiring that she receive medical care. So it's not correct to say that Obama opposed that. Also, Jessen was born in California, not Illinois. We know Jessen is speaking somewhat figuratively here, but the fact is that someone born under similar circumstances in Illinois would have been protected under the law. Obama has said he supported the existing law and felt it provided sufficient protection for abortion survivors like Jessen. We rule her statement False.

pomt-02449	Says Lamar Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare."	false	/texas/statements/2014/feb/27/texas-liberty-pac/legislative-maneuver-continue-government-spending-/	No Republican in Congress voted for the 2010 health-care overhaul known as the Obamacare law. But red-and-white "Stop Lamar Smith" signs that cropped up recently in Austin charge that Smith, a Republican U.S. House member from San Antonio, "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare." The sign attributes the claim to the Texas Liberty PAC. Founder Dave Nalle of Manor told us the group is a newborn Republican-initiated super PAC focused on defeating Smith. The claim stood out to us because Smith voted against the Affordable Care Act, and he doesn’t serve on the House Appropriations Committee, where spending bills originate. And what was the basis of the anti-Smith sign? By email, Nalle said Smith "introduced" the 2014 Omnibus Spending Bill, or House Resolution 3547, which became law on Jan. 17, 2014, according to an online summary posted by Congress. The summary identifies Smith as the proposal’s sponsor. And, Nalle told us, the law "was the primary vehicle through which programs passed in the Affordable Care Act were funded." First, we’ll look at what was in that act, and then we’ll tackle Smith’s role. The spending plan funded the government through September 2014. It cleared the House by 359-67 with Smith voting in favor of it. In a Jan. 15, 2014, press release, Smith said that he supported the spending bill for reasons including defense spending, saying too that the measure did not provide "additional funding" for the Obamacare law. A news story posted Jan. 15, 2014, by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, quoted Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., the Appropriations Committee chairman, as saying: "We've made sure that this bill provides no new funding for Obamacare and have even cut existing Obamacare funds to the tune of over $1 billion." The newspaper said Rogers was referring to a $1 billion cut to a preventive health care fund intended under the Obamacare law. So, the spending plan with Smith’s name attached had at least some funding of the Obamacare law — and it funded many other government initiatives as well. To gauge Smith’s listed sponsorship of the act, we queried experts including Donald Wolfensberger, a former longtime congressional staff member who directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. That’s when this claim began to grow, well, spacy. Wolfensberger told us by email and telephone that Smith’s involvement began when he sponsored an unrelated minor piece of legislation. That bill morphed into the vehicle chosen by congressional leaders to get the crucial spending package passed. Smith "was a hapless victim in some way," Wolfensberger said. Let’s cut to the details. On Nov. 20, 2013, Smith introduced a one-page proposal extending the license application deadline for commercial space launch indemnity insurance, which then "passed the House under suspension of the rules (a process for noncontroversial matters), and then the Senate with an amendment," Wolfensberger noted. These actions occurred Dec. 2 and Dec. 12, 2013, Congress says. A congressional website shows this December 2013 image of Smith’s Senate-amended proposal: After the Senate version of the proposal returned to the House, Wolfensberger said, "Smith’s bill was used as the vehicle in which to stuff the 1,500-page, $1.012-trillion omnibus government funding bill," which then cleared the House and Senate to be signed into law by President Barack Obama on Jan. 17, 2014. It’s nearly 650 pages long, including the limited language of Smith’s original. There was a procedural rationale for changing Smith’s space proposal into the spending plan. Wolfensberger said because the original legislation had already been acted on by the Senate, the House-embraced appropriations swap-in removed an opportunity for Senate opponents to stall it. It all comes down to the parliamentary rules that govern Congress. "It’s still possible to filibuster the meat of a matter from the House," he said, "but there is no option to block proceeding to consideration of a House measure already amended by the Senate that’s coming back from the House." Separately, Smith’s office emailed us an April 5, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirming this point and stating: "The ability to take up a matter without debate can potentially make a difference in the Senate because the Senate then needs to end debate only on the main question (or questions)." Stan Collender, who has written a guide to the federal budget, said by email that most of the Obamacare law’s provisions did not need funding through the appropriations act. "Saying that" Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare is a gross misstatement," Collender said. Also by email, political scientist Roy Meyers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said that while the omnibus act provided some funding to administer the Obamacare law, Smith’s original bill was for a different purpose. "So it's really a classic dirty trick by the Texas Liberty PAC to not acknowledge that the House Rules Committee made this bill the vehicle for passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, amending the original bill to add all of the appropriations language," Meyers said. Smith’s office also sent us an email including Smith’s statement tracking with what we heard from the outside congressional observers. Jennifer Hing, a staff spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, further told us by email that Smith’s measure was the only Senate-approved House bill available at the time the appropriations act was rolled into it. We circled back to Nalle, who said the conversion of Smith’s proposal into the appropriations vehicle doesn’t take away from the fact that Smith sponsored the act funding the Obamacare law. "To suggest that he is not responsible for the sponsorship of a bill which he did sponsor and which he voted to amend and to pass is disingenuous," Nalle emailed. "His votes show that he clearly supported the bill just as much when it passed as when it was originally written. There was no point in the process in which he, as sponsor of the bill, did not cooperate with and support the process which produced the final bill." Our ruling The PAC’s sign said Smith "sponsored the bill that funded Obamacare." To the contrary, legislative leaders amended a brief Smith proposal related to space ships to fold in the 2014 appropriations act, which included some Obamacare-tied expenditures. This claim distorts a leadership strategic maneuver to continue government spending to misrepresent Smith’s role and position on the Obamacare law. We rate it as False.

pomt-15025	Iran’s "regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war" and "has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-iran-blame-more-1000-us-casual/	Iran, a Texas congressman says, warrants blame for American casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack in Washington, D.C. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, delivered the Republican Party’s Sept. 12, 2015, weekly address, speaking mostly about why he opposes the Iran nuclear agreement announced a couple months before. Fourteen years after the 9/11 attacks, McCaul said, "the struggle continues. … We cannot forget that the radical Shi'a regime in Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. Iran's leaders have called for our defeat and the destruction of our close ally, Israel. The regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war; they have plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital and launched destructive cyber attacks against American companies." It’s not a surprise, perhaps, that unfriendly governments including Iran try cyberattacks, nor is it news that Iran has called for Israel’s fall. But we wondered if McCaul was right about Iran being responsible for the described casualties in Iraq and plotting an attack on our nation’s capital. By email, McCaul spokesman Walter Zaykowski answered our request for elaboration by saying the casualty count originated with the Pentagon. He said McCaul’s mention of Iran plotting an attack in Washington, D.C., reflected the May 2013 conviction of an Iranian-American resident of San Antonio for plotting to kill Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States. Let’s check casualties, then flashback to the described plot. Iran’s declared connection to casualties In his email, Zaykowski pointed out September 2015 news stories about more than 1,000 Iran-linked American casualties in Iraq published by Defense One, which focuses on "topics and trends that will define the future of U.S. defense and national security." A Sept. 8, 2015, Defense One story said that according to recently declassified Pentagon documents, 196 American soldiers were killed in Iraq from November 2005 to December 2011 by 1,526 "explosively formed penetrators," which are particularly deadly roadside bombs, with another 861 American soldiers getting injured. SOURCE: News story, "How Many US Troops Were Killed By Iranian IEDs in Iraq?" Defense One, Sept. 8, 2015 (illustration reprinted with permission). The Iran connection? The story said the Pentagon attributes the presence of the EFPs in Iraq "to the Quds Force, the special forces arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by Qasem Soleimani. Various EFP ‘factories’ were found throughout Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom." This sentence in the story included a web link to a Feb. 27, 2007, New York Times news story, datelined Baghdad, describing bomb parts uncovered by U.S. forces in Iraq as possible evidence of factories making EFPs, "which explode and hurl out a high-speed blob of copper designed to cut through tough American armor." According to that story, though, an Iran connection wasn’t firmed up. The story said that while the find gave "experts much more information on the makings of the E.F.P.’s, which the American military has repeatedly argued must originate in Iran, the cache also included items that appeared to cloud the issue. Among the confusing elements were cardboard boxes of the gray plastic PVC tubes used to make the canisters. The boxes appeared to contain shipments of tubes directly from factories in the Middle East, none of them in Iran. One box said in English that the tubes inside had been made in the United Arab Emirates and another said, in Arabic, ‘plastic made in Haditha,’ a restive Sunni town on the Euphrates River in Iran. The Defense One story went on to say "the exact degree to which Iran bears culpability for arming Shia militias in Iraq with EFPs and related equipment is a matter of some dispute." That sentence noted an April 10, 2007, story in the Columbia Journalism Review cautioning against news reporters accepting characterizations of the EFPs as coming from Iran. The Defense One story noted that Gen. Joseph Dunford, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his July 9, 2015, Senate confirmation hearing: "We weren’t always able to attribute the casualties that we had to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn’t necessarily have the forensics to support that." At the hearing, the story said, Dunford said the numbers of American soldiers killed by Iran "has been recently quoted as about 500." Through the Nexis database, we spotted the question that led to Dunford’s assessment. At the hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., asked Dunford: "When you served in Iraq and Afghanistan, do you know how many soldiers, Marines underneath your command were killed by Iranian activities?" DUNFORD: "Senator, I know the total number of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that were killed by Iranian activities, and the number has been recently quoted as about 500. We weren't always able to attribute the casualties that we had to -- to Iranian activity, although many times we suspected it was Iranian activity, even though we didn't necessarily have the forensics to support that." Defense One’s story said the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, "later clarified that Dunford was referring to total American deaths by EFPs and other Iranian weapons." The story quoted Maj. Genieve Davis, a CENTCOM spokeswoman saying in an email that it’s "important to understand that the CENTCOM statistics on EFP detonations are a subset of all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during OIF." David further said data about the roughly 300 deaths not caused by EFPs, including the kind of weapons used in the attacks, is classified, Defense One reported. To our inquiry, CENTCOM spokesman Max Blumenfeld emailed a similar statement saying 196 "U.S. service member deaths resulted from Iranian Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) which are very deadly improvised explosive devices." He said too that those deaths were a subset of "all the Iranian activities estimated to have killed approximately 500 U.S. troops in Iraq during" Operation Iraqi Freedom, the U.S.-led operations in Iraq from March 2003 through August 2010. "For example," Blumenfeld wrote, "there were rocket attacks and IRAM (improvised rocket-assisted munitions) among other tactics that also contributed to American soldier deaths." Along similar lines, a Sept. 11, 2015, Defense One news story said many of the additional deaths likely were caused by improvised rocket assisted munitions, described in one Joint IED Defeat Organization document as "a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister — such as a propane gas tank — filled with explosives, scrap metal and ball bearings and propelled by rockets." First seen in Iraq in 2007, the story said, the IRAM — "essentially an airborne version of a roadside bomb — a flying IED" is "the signature weapon used by Iranian-backed militias that operate with the aid of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Group," the story described the undated document saying. We asked Blumenfeld to specify casualties believed to have been caused by Iranian-connected explosives. He declined, emailing: "We cannot provide more information than what has been already furnished." The D.C. plot So, when did Iran plot a terrorist attack in the U.S. capital? On May 30, 2013, as reported by the Times that day, a U.S. district judge, John F. Keenan, sentenced an Iranian-American living in Texas and accused of plotting to hire assassins to murder Saudi Arabia’s U.S. ambassador to 25 years in prison. The story said Mansour J. Arbabsiar, a naturalized American citizen living in Texas,had been arrested in September 2011 at New York’s Kennedy International Airport, ultimately pleading guilty to his role in a scheme in which he evidently thought he was lining up a Mexican drug cartel to plant a bomb in a Washington restaurant where, the described plot went, the ambassador would be dining. The story said Arbabsiar lived in Corpus Christi though an Oct. 28, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, citing court filings quoting Arbabsiar’s comments to a psychiatrist, said that in 2010, Arbabsiar had moved from Corpus Christi to Round Rock, near Austiin. When Arbabsiar was arrested, the Times story said, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the plot had been "directed and approved by elements of the Iranian government and, specifically, senior members of the Quds force," which is part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Holder said in an Oct. 11, 2011, statement the "deadly plot" was "directed by factions of the Iranian government." Arbabsiar, he said, was being "accused of working with members of an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to devise an international murder-for-hire scheme targeting the" ambassador. Holder said the complaint would say Arbabsiar allegedly orchestrated the plot with Gholam Shakuri, an Iranian-based member of the Qods Force. According to the complaint, Arbabsiar--with Shakuri’s approval--had facilitated the wiring of approximately $100,000 into a bank account in the United States as a down payment for the attempted assassination. Holder said the complaint also said that in the days since the defendant’s arrest, he had confessed to his participation in the alleged plot. The Times story on Arbabsiar’s sentencing said the assassination plan, according to unnamed government officials, involved Arbabsiar paying a member of the Los Zetas drug cartel $1.5 million to plant a bomb at a Washington restaurant while the Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, dined. But Arbabsiar, drawn into the plot by a cousin in Iran who was a high-ranking member of the Quds Force, turned to a man in Mexico he believed was an associate of a drug cartel to hire a team of assassins. And that man turned out to be a confidential informer for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the story said. Keenan noted before imposing the sentence that when Arbabsiar was told that there would probably be 100 to 150 people in the restaurant when it was bombed, he replied, "No problem," or "No big deal," according to a recording of the conversation made secretly by the drug agency’s informer. The story said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office had sought the maximum 25-year sentence, called Mr. Arbabsiar "an enemy among us — the key conduit for, and facilitator of, a nefarious international plot concocted by members of the Iranian military to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and as many innocent bystanders as necessary to get the job done." Arbabsiar, addressing the judge before he was sentenced, said: "Whatever I did wrong, I take responsibility for it. I can’t change what I did. I have a good heart. I never hurt anyone." He added, "My mind sometimes is not in a good place." Arbabsiar’s lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, a federal public defender, had sought a 10-year term, arguing that her client’s crime had been the result of a longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, the story said. Iran denies involvement The Times story also said the Iranian government had denied it had anything to do with the plot. An Oct. 12, 2011, CNN news account said an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, had told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency: "Iran strongly denies the untrue and baseless allegations over a plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to Washington." The CNN story also quoted members of President Barack Obama’s administration saying the plot had involved Iran. The story said Vice President Joe Biden had told NBC News: "Every nation in the world, when they learn the facts of this, will be outraged that (Iran) would violate such an international norm, in addition to obviously being a crime to assassinate anybody, and in the process probably have killed scores of Americans" who may have been in the restaurant at the time of a detonation. Also, CNN reported, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., then the chair of the Senate Armed Intelligence Committee, said after getting briefed that there was no doubt that Iran’s Quds Force was involved in the reported plot, though she could not say if higher levels of Iran’s government were too. "I could surmise that the Quds Force would not have done this without the highest levels of approval from the Revolutionary Guard and, most likely, from some higher elements of the government," Feinstein said. But, she added, she could not specify who might have known. She also added that the alleged plot may have been just one in a series of such schemes. "It's hard for me to believe that there is just one plot involving the United States," she said. Our ruling McCaul said Iran’s "regime is responsible for more than 1,000 American casualties during the Iraq war" and "has plotted a terrorist attack here in our nation's capital." McCaul has backing for this statement, although it needs clarification. To our query, a military spokesman stopped short of confirming the number of injuries the Pentagon associates with allegedly Iranian-connected explosives and Iran (perhaps unbelievably) has denied any connection to the Texas-tied plot to hire a hit man to plant a bomb in Washington, D.C.

pomt-00299	Says Richard Cordray’s "plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/26/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-misleads-about-issue-1-drug-amendment-/	Republican Mike DeWine says Democrat Richard Cordray is soft on drug dealers in Ohio, a state hit hard by the opioid crisis. "Cordray’s plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets," says DeWine’s TV ad. "Even when they are caught with enough fentanyl to kill 10,000 people. The same drug that is killing Ohioans every day. Cordray’s plan would create a safe haven for drug dealers." The ad refers to Corday’s support for Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that would reduce possession offenses to misdemeanors. DeWine, the attorney general, opposes the amendment. The question will appear on the November ballot when DeWine and Cordray face off for governor. We found that DeWine miscasts what the amendment would do and omits what Cordray has said about drug dealers. Key takeaways: • This isn’t "Cordray’s plan," although he supports the amendment. • Cordray has said drug dealers should serve long sentences. • The amendment reduces possession of drugs to a misdemeanor. • The amendment states that drug trafficking would remain a felony. Issue 1 on November ballot If adopted, the amendment would reclassify drug possession -- including fentanyl -- as a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. Also, those already convicted of possession could ask a court to reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor. Felons, with some exceptions for certain offenses, could get a 25 percent reduction in prison time if they participate in rehabilitative, work or educational programs. Money that is saved from imprisonment would go toward rehabilitation and crime victim funds. But the amendment doesn’t let drug traffickers, a.k.a. dealers, off the hook. It states that the misdemeanor provisions "do not apply to convictions for the sale, distribution, or trafficking of drugs" or for convictions based on volume or weight that were classified as a first-, second-, or third-degree felony offense. That leaves fourth- and fifth-degree felony possessions to be reclassified misdemeanors, which the DeWine campaign says would include fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. DeWine’s campaign points to an op-ed against the amendment by Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court Maureen O’Connor who said an offender charged with possession of 19 grams of fentanyl would only receive a misdemeanor. Since the lethal dose of fentanyl is just 2 milligrams, 19 grams of fentanyl is enough to kill about 10,000 people, she wrote. But the key here is the word "possession." Defendants who deal drugs can still be charged with felony trafficking, said Ohio State University Law professor Doug Berman, executive director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center. "This is not about giving drug dealers a break; this is about freeing up resources to provide treatment to reduce the demand for the drugs," Berman said. The amendment will make prosecutors jobs harder -- they will no longer be able to only charge defendants with possession and send them to prison. Instead, they will have to prove trafficking, which involves additional elements beyond just merely possession -- and would mean that prosecutors would be putting their undercover officers on the stand. Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association argues the amendment may prevent felony charges for traffickers "who deliberately deal in small amounts so that they can assert simple possession as a defense." Kenneth R. Bailey , president of the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said someone caught with a small amount of fentanyl could be charged with misdemeanor possession. But DeWine still isn’t telling the full story. "In practice, trafficking is an often used companion charge to possession," Bailey said. "If Issue 1 passes, there is nothing that prevents a prosecutor from bringing the misdemeanor possession count with a companion felony trafficking (charge)." Generally, trafficking is not defined by the amount of the drug, but the purpose for which the possessor is going to use the drug, he said. In one case, a defendant was charged with trafficking for 10 grams of heroin and aggravated trafficking for possessing a bag containing less than a gram of heroin and fentanyl. The defense lawyers association is supporting Issue 1 with reservations, including the form of its implementation as an amendment and the removal of judicial discretion. Cordray’s comments about the amendment DeWine’s ad says it is "Cordray’s plan" to let the drug dealers go free. While Cordray has stated support for Issue 1, it isn’t his plan. Advocates collected signatures to place it on the ballot. Also, DeWine is ignoring that Cordray has distinguished between penalties he wants to see for users and drug dealers. Cordray has said, "As governor, I will work with law enforcement to make sure drug dealers are convicted and serve long prison sentences, while people who need substance abuse treatment can get it in our communities." At least 11 states as of January 2018 have lowered some drug possession crimes from a felony to a misdemeanor, said Alison Lawrence, who tracks drug laws for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Our ruling DeWine’s ad says Cordray’s "plan would allow drug dealers to remain on our streets." Issue 1 would lower possession to a misdemeanor and prohibit jail time until an individual's third offense within two years. That could apply to someone in possession of fentanyl, which is deadly in small amounts. Cordray supports the amendment, but it's a far stretch to call it his plan.

pomt-07760	"The things I said (during the prank call by a blogger posing as GOP contributor David Koch) are the things I’ve said publicly all along" about the Wisconsin budget debate.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/24/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-remarks-during/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faced the Madison press corps after an audio recording revealed his conversation with a prankster he thought was billionaire business executive David Koch, the conservative activist and Walker supporter. One reporter asked how state residents could trust Walker given that he told the Koch impersonator he’d "thought about" bringing in agitators to disrupt protests over his budget -- and planned a ruse to get AWOL Senate Democrats back to Madison. Walker downplayed his conversation as routine. "I take phone calls all the time," he said. "I took phone calls from small business owners earlier, from this individual … I actually talked to one of the Senate Democrats over the weekend, hoping they might be interested in finding a way to come back. I’ve talked to individual taxpayers across the state." He added about his conversation with the Koch fake: "But the bottom line is, the things I said are the things I’ve said publicly all along." That caught our ear. In executing the prank, Ian Murphy, the Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as Koch, got what sounded like an insider’s-view briefing from Walker during the 20-minute chat. To be sure, in the call Walker covered a lot of ground familiar to anyone following the budget showdown. Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie told us the same thing. The governor "has consistently talked about getting Democrats to come back to Wisconsin and do their job, which he did in the call as well," Werwie wrote in an e-mail. "He has consistently talked about need for civil discourse. He has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations." Let’s take a look. Walker told the caller about his threat of laying off state workers, one he made publicly on multiple occasions earlier in the week, and of a plan to block the Senate Democrats getting paychecks through automatic deposit, also discussed publicly. He had also has made clear in recent days that he would not negotiate or budge from his plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for state employees. He told the fake Koch the same thing. But several other items in the Walker-blogger conversation stood out. We asked Werwie if he could show that the governor had previously talked publicly about these topics Walker covered during the phone call: -- Ronald Reagan: Walker recounted how, as he prepared to release his plan, he took inspiration from Reagan, who fired air-traffic controllers after an illegal strike. Walker said his budget plan could "change the course of history" in Wisconsin just as Reagan’s stance -- in Walker’s view -- had branded the president as tough and led to the fall of communism. -- Planting troublemakers at protests: The fake Koch told Walker he was thinking about "planting troublemakers" at the pro-union rallies. Walker said "we thought about that" but rejected it because it might backfire if "there’s a ruckus caused that would scare the public into thinking maybe the governor has to settle to avoid all these problems." -- Dealing with the Democrats: Walker said during the call he would agree to speak with Democratic legislative leaders if all 14 senators return to Madison. He said he believes if Democrats return to the Capitol, the Senate would have a quorum and could approve the budget-repair bill - even if Democrats again left before the vote was called. -- Asking "Koch" for help: Walker asks for support of the "guys" -- an apparent reference to GOP lawmakers from political swing districts who are worried about how the union vote will play at home. The message needs to get out "over and over" in those districts, Walker said. It’s not clear if Walker means TV ads. Walker told reporters he was not referring to political campaign messages. Koch is the chief backer of Americans for Prosperity, which on Feb. 23, 2011, announced it was spending $342,200 on advertising to persuade Wisconsin residents to back Walker's plan. Werwie took issue with any portrayal of Walker as agreeing to the ruse involving Democrats, or any suggestion that Walker was coordinating political campaign messages with the man he thought was Koch. Regarding Walker’s talk of making history like Reagan, Werwie said Walker "has consistently talked about the need to make long term, historic decisions that will effect future generations." But Werwie did not provide any evidence that Walker had spoken publicly about President Reagan and the air traffic controllers union, the specific plan to lure senators back, the consideration of planting agitators at protests or discussions about outside "message" help for GOP lawmakers. We did our own search of news archives. George Will, the conservative commentator for the Washington Post, drew the Walker-Reagan comparison in regard to the air traffic controllers strike in 1981. He interviewed Walker for a column that ran Feb. 21. He does not quote Walker making the comparison; it is written as Will’s observation. We tried but couldn’t reach Will or Werwie as to whether Walker mentioned he was inspired by Reagan’s actions in the controllers strike. In a New York Times profile on Feb. 20, Walker said he drew inspiration from Reagan because Reagan "didn’t flinch." The story does not indicate the context of that quote. As for the plan to get Democrats to return from self-imposed exile in Illinois, we could find no new accounts about Walker and the GOP considering the ruse he discusses on the audio of the phone call. On the issue of outside "troublemakers," we could find no news accounts of Wisconsin Republicans considering this tactic. Walker, in his Feb. 22 fireside chat, had pointed at the other side, expressing concern that protesters "pouring in" from other states would affect the civility of the debate. Let’s wind this down. Walker sought to downplay the news value in his phone conversation with the blogger by saying, in essence, there was nothing new. While some of the discussion was old news, the chat did produce some revelations about strategy, tactics and Walker’s view of his actions. So, is Walker right that what was said privately matches what he has consistently said publicly? That rates a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-02774	"FACT: Repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/09/heritage-foundation/heritage-foundation-tweet-says-repealing-obamacare/	If the whirlwind of news about the bumpy rollout of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law is making you dizzy, maybe it’s time to go for a drink. Maybe at a speakeasy? We had this idea after seeing a tweet sent recently by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think-tank. Heritage, which opposes the Affordable Care Act, sent a tweet that featured a black-and-white photograph of people celebrating the 21st Amendment, which made it legal to buy, sell, transport and drink alcohol. The caption was: "FACT: Repealing Obamacare would be easier than repealing Prohibition." The tweet seems logical at first glance — after all, Prohibition was a constitutional amendment, while Obama’s health care law is "only" a law. But would it really be easier? Experts say the issue is actually more complicated than it looks. Repealing Prohibition First, let’s go back to 1917, when Congress passed the Volstead Act, a nationwide ban on the sale, production, importation and transportation of alcohol beverages. In 1919, the Volstead Act became the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. During the "dry" period, lasting from 1920 to 1933, organized crime increased significantly. With public support flagging, the 18th Amendment was scuttled after only 13 years, through ratification of the 21st Amendment, on Dec. 5, 1933. The repeal -- as do all repeals of constitutional amendments -- required a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, as well as approval by three quarters of the states. Repealing a constitutional amendment is always "a very difficult path," said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist. "That said, it was a fairly simple piece of policy to reverse, all things considered. Many states immediately changed their policies and legal drinking began right away," Loomis said. All told, it only took eight months to reach enough states -- 36 -- to completely overturn Prohibition. Repealing Obamacare What about repealing Obamacare? In theory, enacting or repealing a law, such as Obamacare, requires a simple majority in both the Senate and the House, followed by a presidential signature. That could happen pretty quickly if all parties were to agree. If both chambers of Congress agreed but president vetoed the bill, then a two-thirds vote is required in both houses. On the surface, then, "repeal of Obamacare appears to be easier than repeal of the 18th Amendment," concluded Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at the Washington University in St. Louis. It doesn’t involve the states at all, and it can be passed by a simple majority if the president agrees. (No constitutional amendment has been ratified since 1992, and the previous one before that was in 1971, suggesting how hard a climb it is.) But repealing a law like Obamacare is hardly a piece of cake. For starters, scholars we interviewed all stressed how complex Obamacare is. The Affordable Care Act has 2,074 pages, a fact Republicans regularly complain about. (Take a look here at our fact-check of the actual length of the bill.) By contrast, the 18th Amendment that enacted Prohibition consists of only three paragraphs. The same goes for the 21st, which repealed it. "The fact that the tweet (from the Heritage Foundation) is missing, is that there are 10 titles to the ACA," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor. "It’s not only health care, it’s also Medicare, Medicaid, fraud and abuse laws, preventive care laws, etc." In addition, many provisions of Obamacare have already been enacted over the past few years, such as new regulations for medical education and training, preventive care, the right of parents to add children up to 26 years old on their policies, and an end to insurer rejections for pre-existing conditions for children and lifetime caps on medical expenses. "If all of those were repealed, no one knows what would happen to the insured," Jost said. There would also be a risk that any fraud or abuse cases currently prosecuted under the health care laws would also have to be dismissed. In addition, Medicare and Medicaid were modified and expanded as part of Obamacare, and the so-called doughnut hole for Medicare prescription drug coverage was closed. "If you repeal Obamacare and do nothing else, that would probably lead to a stop of all Medicaid payments," Jost said. Length of a possible repeal So let’s say Congress and the president really wanted to go through with a repeal of the health care law. How long would that take? "Responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long, many hundreds or thousands of times longer than the three sentences of the 21st amendment" needed to repeal Prohibition, political scientist Steven Smith said. Then there’s a whole separate problem: Many states have changed their laws according to the federal health care law, so each of those states would have to be repealed and rewritten as well. If you include all of these factors, Smith concluded, "the repeal of Obamacare legislation would be much more difficult to write than the 21st Amendment." When we ran these critiques by the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the think tank, said he disagreed. "The claim that ‘responsible legislation repealing Obamacare would be quite long’ is ridiculous," Spakovsky said. He argued that it would only take a one-paragraph bill to repeal the health care law in its entirety. "The word ‘responsible’ is the key word that other so-called experts use to dispute this," Spakovsky said. "They clearly believe that parts of Obamacare should be preserved." Our ruling The Heritage Foundation tweeted that it would be easier to repeal Obamacare than it was to repeal Prohibition. It’s correct that, on paper, it’s procedurally easier to repeal a law than to repeal a constitutional amendment. However, Obamacare is a much more complicated piece of legislation than Prohibition was, meaning it would likely be far more complicated to eliminate all vestiges of the law. The Heritage tweet oversimplifies the debate. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-14269	Race to the Top grants "require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/apr/08/david-jolly/common-core-required-win-obama-grants-us-rep-da/	Looking to take over former presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, U.S. Rep. David Jolly wants to educate voters about his conservative bona fides in Congress — including his opposition to Common Core. The Indian Shores Republican has been in the House of Representatives for two years after winning a 2014 special election to replace his mentor, the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young. In that short span, he said, he has helped change federal education policy. "Last year, I worked with my colleagues to end funding for federal Race to the Top grants, which require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding," he said on his campaign website. The Common Core State Standards are a set of shared guidelines in English and math designed to prepare students for college and to unify educational goals nationwide. They’ve become an unpopular subject with many conservatives. We decided to test Jolly’s assertion that states had to adopt the Common Core in order to win federal grants. Race to the Top Our lesson begins with a primer on Common Core. In 2007, the Council of Chief State School Officers considered creating state-based standards that could be shared nationwide. The idea was that a high school diploma from Tennessee would then have the same value as one from Idaho or New Mexico. Two years later, the council and the National Governors Association agreed to develop what was called Common Core with input from teachers, parents and education experts. President Barack Obama’s signature education program, Race to the Top, invited states to compete for grant money from the 2009 federal economic stimulus. States had to show they were committed to improving educational standards and performance and implement reforms to win the cash. The final Common Core guidelines came out in 2010, and states could decide to use them or ignore them. Forty-five states decided to accept the standards. Minnesota adopted the English standards, but not the math guidelines. Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina agreed to use Common Core at first, but later backed off the plan. Jolly’s assertion is that the application process demanded states adopt Common Core to get a grant. That isn’t the case. Committing to Common Core was not a stipulation of winning a grant, but it did factor into the application process. The Education Department gave states that had adopted a set of standards extra points (40 of a possible 500) when competing for grants. The shorthand was, if you had adopted Common Core, you had a better chance at hitting the federal grant lottery. Jolly’s campaign pointed out the guidelines for the grant process that said applicants had to show a "commitment to adopting a common set of high-quality standards." They reasoned that almost all of the 19 eventual grant winners (including Florida, which won $700 million in August 2010) had adopted Common Core before winning grants. But experts told us there was no demand that states adopt Common Core before Washington would hand over funding. And even then, there was no requirement for actually implementing them. Delaware, for example, won its grant in March 2010, but didn’t adopt Common Core until August of that year. Tennessee also won in March 2010, but adopted them in July of that year. Daniel Thatcher, a senior policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said Washington has subsequently been accused of coercing states into adopting Common Core. In 2015, a federal judge rejected former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s coercion claims in a lawsuit he brought against the Education Department, which his successor has since ended. Common Core did have supporters in Washington, although they often were careful about not using the term Common Core. But many state legislators and teachers unions and education reformers approved of Common Core at the time, too. (For the record, even Jindal once was a Common Core advocate before changing his mind and suing the federal government.) "For any single state, it's difficult to know whether Race to the Top merely rewarded an applicant for doing something it was already inclined to do, or whether the competition changed behavior in any material way," University of Chicago political science professor William Howell said in an email. He noted the timing of the grants during the recession may have potentially spurred some states into action to shore up finances, leading them to adopt Common Core to get a leg up. "It's hard not to conclude that features of the competition were at least partially responsible," Howell said. Congress stripped funding for Race to the Top state grants out of the spending bill it passed in December 2014. Jolly voted for the measure. His campaign said Jolly helped keep funding out of the following year’s bill after he joined the House Appropriations Committee in January 2015. Obama did not ask for Race to the Top funding in his FY 2016 budget proposal. The remaining funds for the grant program expired in September 2015. In December 2015, Jolly also voted in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act. That bill, signed by Obama, specifically said the Secretary of Education "shall not attempt to influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards." Our ruling Jolly said Race to the Top grants "require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding." Adopting education guidelines — Common Core or otherwise — was an element of a state’s overall application score and would add to point totals. Common Core critics have since accused Washington of coercing states. But there was no concrete requirement to adopt standards in exchange for grant money. Experts told us the promise of federal money during the recession may have spurred Common Core adoption in some places, but there’s no way to know that for sure.

pomt-01877	An image of nine white, blond women shows "the amazing diversity of Fox News anchors."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/09/facebook-posts/facebook-post-blondes-fox-news/	For several years, this image has made the rounds on social media. We found it recently on the photo page of a San Francisco area journalist, Jamal Dajani. "The amazing diversity of Fox News anchors," Dajani wrote in a post that had been shared nearly 12,000 times by July 9, 2014. The image, Dajani told us, "reflects the uniformity of the Fox narrative -- one dimensional." In this case, the nine images are all of white women with blond hair. It's not a new dig at Fox News. Saturday Night Live mocked Fox News' lack of diversity in 2010, referring to a guest only as "attractive blonde lady" in a sketch. But with the revival of this Facebook image, we wanted to see if the criticism holds water. We can't verify that all nine people pictured are Fox News anchors or hosts (matching images can be dicey). But we can check how closely the Facebook image matches the full line-up of Fox News female personalities. We went through the Fox News website and picked out all the women with anchor or host in their job description (rotating anchor and co-host qualified). For the record, Fox News has plenty of male hosts, too, but we decided to look only at women since that was the focus of the Facebook image. Fox News female hosts and anchors' hair color We realize deciding whether a person’s hair is or isn’t blond can be a judgment call. But we included the images of each host so you can reach your own conclusion. Of the 26 female hosts and anchors listed on the Fox News website, by our count roughly about half are blond and half are not. That's not nearly how the Facebook image had it. Fox News female hosts and anchors' race As you can see from the images above, the majority of Fox News' female on-air talent is white. But they are not universally white. Arthel Neville is African-American and Uma Pemmaraju describes herself as the first Indian-American anchor to regularly appear on national television. Our ruling A Facebook post used an image of female Fox News anchors to say that the network lacks diversity in its staff. We found that for those women who are anchors or hosts in any capacity, about half are blond. And while most are white, not all are. The Facebook image gives the strong impression that all female Fox News anchors and hosts look alike. That's misleading. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02651	"I started the whole year" as a senior on the University of Illinois football team and "led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/15/scott-turner/scott-turner-house-speaker-hopeful-didnt-lead-coll/	A first-term Texas legislator recently revisited his youthful determination to become a professional football player. State Rep. Scott Turner, R-Frisco, speaking Jan. 8, 2014, at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference in Austin, said he made it to the NFL despite being sidelined through his first three seasons as a student-athlete at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Turner, lately an aspirant for speaker of the Texas House, said he thrived as a player only after agreeing to switch from offensive positions to defensive back. Referring to his senior season, Turner said: "I started the whole year, led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back." That’s quite an accomplishment in that many defenders can pile up tackles and interceptions. We were curious. The online 2013 Illinois Football Record Book from the university does not show Turner leading the Fighting Illini in tackles or interceptions in any seasons. At our request, Derek Neal, a University of Illinois spokesman, checked the football program’s "archive book" for the 1994 season. By phone, Neal confirmed that Turner started each of that season’s games at cornerback but said other players led the team in tackles and interceptions. Turner had 48 tackles, Neal said. Seven players had more: three linebackers, two safeties, a defensive end and defensive tackle. Dana Howard, a linebacker, led with 150 tackles, he said. Turner had two interceptions that season, Neal said, as did three other players. Another cornerback, Robert Crumpton, led the team with four interceptions, Neal said. After we obtained these figures, Turner told us he’d intended to indicate that he led players at his position--cornerback--in tackles and interceptions; he said by phone that he’d forgotten he trailed a fellow cornerback in interceptions. "I know that defensive backs never lead the team in tackles. If you do, that’s a horrible team... If I misspoke, obviously, I apologize for that," Turner said. "I don’t need to embellish the truth. I played." Our ruling Turner said he started every game of his senior season, leading the team in tackles and interceptions from defensive back. Turner indeed started every game. But he finished eighth in tackles and tied for second in interceptions with several players. He also did not lead defensive backs in either category. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

The "you're not giving us reasonable time to debate this important legislation" is a well-worn minority party refrain. But we wondered whether Barton was accurate when he said the House Energy and Commerce Committee has not — and will not — hold a single hearing on a major portion of the $850 billion stimulus plan that came before it. Here's what Barton said on Jan. 22: "While I understand the majority’s desire to move quickly on the stimulus package, I think the short leash that the speaker has put us on restricts our ability to write competent legislation. We have not had a single hearing on anything in front of us, meaning that the only opinion we’ve heard on the expenditure of billions of dollars is that of the speaker. We’ve been told that even one hearing would be one too many, and that we have a single day to approve these five complex propositions that will affect the lives of millions. That’s because the speaker wants the entire stimulus package on the House floor next week. “By my count, in front of us are 269 pages of text. I have not yet seen the most recent CBO score, but suffice it to say that these 269 pages approve the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars. Will this package of legislation waste money? Will it abuse people? Will it raise a dust cloud of unintended and unhappy consequences? Will we be embarrassed by some of what we approve here today? The answer is yes, yes, yes and yes." The portion of the stimulus plan that came before Energy and Commerce Committee includes about $170 billion in proposed spending. No one challenges the claim that the massive spending bill is being fast-tracked. At a congressional forum on Jan. 7, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained the urgency this way: "Nothing could be clearer than the fact that we need action and we need action now. A failure to act quickly can only lead to more job losses and more economic pain for Americans. If we act boldly and rapidly, we can begin to create new jobs and opportunities today and strengthen our economy, as you said, for the long run." President Obama has said he wants to have the package approved by mid February. Republicans have cried foul, saying there has been little effort by Democrats to craft a bipartisan package, and that they only received a draft of the proposal on Jan. 16. Less than a week later, the plan came before the House Appropriations, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce committees, for one day of "markups." That means committee members can propose amendments. On Jan. 22, Barton's Energy and Commerce Committee, on which he is the senior Republican, held a marathon 12-hour "markup" session during which numerous amendments were added to the proposal. The fate of amendments largely depended on which side of the aisle the suggestions came from, as nearly all of the dozens of Republican-backed amendments were rejected. Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office, said while congressional committees are typically permitted hearings on major spending plans, "when there's an emergency, they tend not to go along in regular order. ... When the leadership of both houses agrees it's important enough to circumvent, then they'll go around the regular order." The minority party almost always objects, he said, but both parties have done it when they control the majority. "It's not unprecedented by any means," Ritchie said of bypassing hearings. But it is unusual for such a large spending plan. "There hasn't been anything of that magnitude in a long time," Ritchie said. "That stands out by itself, I think." Barton used words like "abomination" and "truly an insult" to describe the fast-tracking of the plan. By way of explaining the need for a streamlined review, Committee Chairman Rep. Henry A. Waxman said, "We are in a deep and long recession. Our unemployment rate is over 7 percent and growing. We urgently need an economic recovery package — and we need it immediately." On Jan. 23, Obama met with Republican leadership to get their input on the proposed stimulus package; and he agreed to meet with the Republican caucuses this week, though many Republicans scoffed at the suggestion it will result in anything close to a bipartisan plan. One can argue whether the urgency of the economic crisis outweighs the need for deliberate consideration through congressional hearings, but Barton is right: There have been no hearings on the massive stimulus package that Congress is expected to vote on as early as this week.

pomt-09406	"In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/20/pat-carlson/texas-eagle-forum-says-texas-schools-dont-have-tea/	While making a case for abstinence-only sex education, the right-leaning Texas Eagle Forum recently declared that sex isn't a mandated topic in Texas schools. The group states in its March 11 "News & Notes" e-mail blast: "In Texas, schools do not even have to teach sex education." Teaching the birds and bees, optional? "In my understanding, it's a local level decision," said Pat Carlson of Fort Worth, the forum's Texas president. She pointed us to the state's education code, which requires each school district's board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council, with at least five members, including parents, clergy and law enforcement officials. The council makes recommendations on the health curriculum taught in the district's schools. An excerpt from the law: "Any course materials and instruction relating to human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, or human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome shall be selected by the board of trustees with the advice of the local school health advisory council." The law further states that "before each school year, a school district shall provide written notice to a parent of each student enrolled in the district of the board of trustees' decision regarding whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction to district students." Whether the district will provide human sexuality instruction? That doesn't sound like a requirement. However, schools do have to follow the state board of education's curriculum standards — Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills — according to a spokeswoman at the Texas Education Agency, which oversees primary and secondary public education. And that curriculum requires health teachers to teach sex education at appropriate grade levels. The state's guidelines for health classes state that in grades 9-10, for example, "the student analyzes the relationship between unsafe behaviors and personal health and develops strategies to promote resiliency throughout the life span." The student is expected to explore "the relationship between the use of refusal skills and the avoidance of unsafe situations such as sexual abstinence... the importance and benefits of abstinence as it relate to emotional health and the prevention of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases... discuss abstinence from sexual activity as the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy," and so forth. On the one hand, it sounds like local school districts can opt out of teaching sex ed. On the other, it sounds like they're required to spell out the particulars. There's another wrinkle. Last year, state lawmakers voted to no longer require high-school students to take a health course to graduate. But a TEA spokeswoman told us schools are still required to offer the course. Confused? Apparently, so is the state education agency. "It's clear as mud, " said David Anderson, the agency's legal counsel. "There is some ambiguity that a school district has to teach parts of the state curriculum about human sexuality." Anderson explained the history of this issue this way: "When the curriculum was first written in 1995 — foundation curriculum and enrichment curriculum — and districts had to teach all of the foundation curriculum, like algebra, they did not have to teach every part of the enrichment curriculum. That's where health was." Anderson noted that Attorney General Dan Morales issued an advisory opinion in 1998 stating that local school districts control the teaching of human sexuality in any enrichment curriculum (fine arts, foreign languages, technology, and health and physical education) — meaning school districts could choose not to teach sex ed. Anderson said lawmakers later amended state law to require districts to teach everything spelled out in state curriculum standards. Despite that change, Anderson said, local districts still control what — if anything — is taught about human sexuality. "It's at least an open question if a school board is required to teach some part of the health curriculum which some people might regard as sex education," Anderson said. "My guess is districts are making their (sex education) decisions locally and people are happy with that." The only unquestioned mandate that school districts must meet, said Anderson, is the parenting and paternity awareness program taught as part of high-school health classes. He added, "But I'm not sure everyone would think that means sex ed." We asked the attorney general's office to weigh in. Its spokesman, Jerry Strickland, declined, saying: "We don't provide legal opinions lightly; because of that, this would truly be an issue for TEA." When we asked Anderson plainly if schools are required to teach sex education, he said: "It's not a yes or no answer." How's this for clarity? If the responsible state agency cannot answer "yes," there is no requirement. We rate Carlson's statement as True.	None	Pat Carlson	None	None	None	2010-03-20T17:12:45	2010-03-11	['Texas']

"BREAKING: Queen Elizabeth II Dead At 94," said a May 9 headline by The Liberty Raise. The story appears to be copied from The Daily World Update, a website that purports to be satire. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The story claimed that the queen died of a stroke in her home in Windsor. According to the story, the queen was awake throughout the stroke and managed to give some parting advice: "Don’t trust Donald Trump."

There is no truth to this headline or story. First off, the queen is 92 years old, not 94. But more importantly, the queen is not dead. If the queen had died, it would be reported by legitimate news outlets, like the BBC or the Guardian. And there would likely be a post about it in press releases of the official website of the British Royal family (which is teeming with news about the birth of Prince Louis and the impending nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry). In reality, on the same day this hoax published, the queen was actually at the Royal Windsor Horse Show where she was pictured smiling. When the queen does pass away, it will be the "most disruptive event in Britain in the last 70 years," according to Business Insider. "For at least 12 days — between her passing, the funeral and beyond — Britain will grind to a halt," the article said. "It'll cost the British economy billions in lost earnings." There was one recent death in the royal family: the queen’s dog, Willow. Willow, the 14-year old corgi was put down in April following a battle with cancer. Willow’s death was particularly significant, as it was the last in a long line of royal corgis. We rate the story about the queen being dead Pants on Fire!

pomt-03235	Sen. Marco Rubio "refuses to accept the basic science" on climate change and is "a climate change denier."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/16/organizing-action/group-backing-barack-obama-says-marco-rubio-climat/	In a recent email to supporters in Florida, Organizing for Action -- a group that supports President Barack Obama -- criticized the climate change policies of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the Senate’s leading Republicans and a possible 2016 presidential contender. The email, signed by Ivan Frishberg, the group’s climate campaign manager, begins like this: "Friend -- "We're spending the next week of Action August getting serious about climate change. "To get ready, we're calling out Sen. Marco Rubio, who refuses to accept the basic science on this issue -- and is standing in the way of action. "It's time everyone in Florida knows: Sen. Rubio is a climate change denier." The email goes on to say that "there are 135 documented climate change deniers currently roaming the halls of Congress." The full list is here, but in this item we’ll be focusing on whether Rubio "is a climate change denier." We should clarify up front: In the policy context, the term "climate change" refers to rising temperatures and sea levels caused by human beings and their use of carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels. (We should also note that Rubio’s staff did not respond when contacted for this story.) In supporting its claim, OFA cites a Feb. 13, 2010, article in the Tampa Tribune. According to the Tribune, Rubio called his then-Senate opponent Charlie Crist "a believer in man-made global warming" and said, "I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it." Asked whether he accepts scientific evidence that the global climate is undergoing change, Rubio responded, "The climate is always changing. The climate is never static. The question is whether it's caused by man-made activity and whether it justifies economically destructive government regulation." After trying to locate as many of Rubio’s comments on climate change as we could, we concluded that the Tribune story is indeed the strongest evidence OFA can use to support its labeling of Rubio as a "climate change denier." Rubio’s language to the Tribune is pretty clear: He doesn’t think there’s sufficient scientific evidence to support the claim that the climate is changing due to human factors. However, on other occasions -- both before and after the Tribune interview -- Rubio has offered somewhat more nuanced opinions on the topic. Initially, when he was speaker of the Florida House, Rubio seemed to tacitly support the idea that the earth’s temperatures were rising, even as he sometimes differed with environmentalists over specific policy options. While Rubio was speaker in 2008, the House unanimously passed a law ordering the state Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide, a pollutant that scientists say may be contributing to global warming. In a 2007 speech to fellow legislators, Rubio urged his state to become a Silicon Valley of the new energy-technology economy. "Global warming, dependence on foreign sources of fuel, and capitalism have come together to create opportunities for us that were unimaginable just a few short years ago," he said. "Today, Florida has the opportunity to pursue bold energy policies, not just because they’re good for our environment, but because people can actually make money doing it. This nation and ultimately the world is headed toward emission caps and energy diversification." By phrasing it this way, without any effort to question the scientific underpinnings of global warming, Rubio suggested that he tacitly supported the science behind global warming. He made the same implication when he wrote in a 2007 Miami Herald op-ed, "Whether motivated by global warming or geopolitics, there is widespread support for diversifying our energy portfolio and becoming more efficient in our use of energy." By Dec. 10, 2009, Rubio was openly hedging his position on climate change science. Confronted with accusations that he had flip-flopped on climate change, Rubio told the Miami Herald, "I'm not a scientist. I'm not qualified to make that decision. There's a significant scientific dispute about that.'' Rubio’s next flurry of comments on climate change came in 2013, after he had become a leading figure in the national GOP. Here are Rubio’s recent comments: • BuzzFeed interview, Feb. 5, 2013: In a video interview with the website BuzzFeed, Rubio said, "The United States is a country, not a planet. On the other hand, if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy, you could have a devastating impact on economics. ... There has to be a cost-benefit analysis to every one of these principles people are pushing on. … The climate’s always changing -- that’s not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is whether man-made activity is what’s contributing most to it. I know people said there’s a significant scientific consensus on that issue, but I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle." • Republican response to the State of the Union address, Feb. 12, 2013. Responding to Obama’s speech, Rubio said, "When we point out that no matter how many job-killing laws we pass, our government can’t control the weather – he accuses us of wanting dirty water and dirty air." • Fox and Friends interview, Feb. 13, 2013. The day after his response to the State of the Union address, Rubio said, "The government can’t change the weather. I said that in the speech. We can pass a bunch of laws that will destroy our economy, but it isn’t going to change the weather. Because, for example, there are other countries that are polluting in the atmosphere much greater than we are at this point -- China, India, all these countries that are still growing. They’re not going to stop doing what they’re doing. America is a country, it’s not a planet. So we can pass a bunch of laws or executive orders that will do nothing to change the climate or the weather but will devastate our economy -- devastate it." • Statement on his Senate Web page, posted June 25, 2013: In response to a speech in which Obama outlined a series of measures on climate change that he could accomplish by executive order, Rubio said: "This time, President Obama is discarding the Constitution and free enterprise system in the name of a job-killing environmental agenda. We must do everything we can to stand in his way." In these comments, Rubio expressed strong opposition to Obama’s climate change policies, particularly on the grounds that the benefits would not exceed the costs. And he seemed to exude skepticism that climate change was an urgent policy concern, as well as the sentiment that human actions cannot change something as massive as the weather. Still, in these comments, Rubio never explicitly denied the science behind climate change, as he did three years earlier in the Tribune interview. In fact, in the BuzzFeed conversation, Rubio conceded that "I’ve actually seen reasonable debate on that principle." Someone who is a "denier" does not typically concede that his opponents may have a "reasonable" point. Our ruling Organizing for Action said that Rubio "refuses to accept the basic science" on climate change and is "a climate change denier." Rubio’s 2010 comments to the Tampa Tribune -- when he said, "I don't think there's the scientific evidence to justify it" -- represent the clearest evidence in support of the group’s charge. In that comment, Rubio does sound like he is denying the existence of science that supports the climate change hypothesis. Since then -- including on four separate occasions this year -- Rubio has expressed opposition to climate change policies while speaking more cautiously about the science that proves climate change is happening. On one of those occasions in February, he even conceded that he’s seen "reasonable debate" about the question. But in none of those instances did Rubio walk back his 2010 remarks, even though he had several opportunities to do so. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05074	The Wisconsin Retirement System for public employees is "a self-funded pension plan" and "it’s the money of the workers’ that funds it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/04/afscme/labor-leader-marty-beil-says-state-pension-plan-se/	Gov. Scott Walker fueled fears in some state government workers about pension security when he initiated a study that public-sector unions saw as a step toward a 401(k)-style plan they see as less secure. When the study came out July 2, 2012, it recommended against adding an optional "defined contribution" plan to the state pension system, and Walker said he was not "currently" planning "substantial" changes. Some conservative critics have decried the guaranteed pensions in the current "defined benefit" plan, while defenders noted the best-in-the-nation fiscal health of the Wisconsin Retirement System. On June 14, 2012 the state’s highest-profile public employee labor leader, Marty Beil, talked pensions during an appearance on the liberal "Sly in the Morning" radio show on Madison’s WTDY radio. Beil, executive director of District Council 24 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), said "we have pensions here that are not out of line. We have pensions that don’t put huge amounts of economic burden on the taxpayers." Beil went on: "It’s really the employees’ money, and that has to be told, and has to be told to legislators, to neighbors and friends -- that this really is a self-funded pension plan. It’s the money of the workers’ that funds it." In 2010, the state pension system paid out some $3.9 billion. That’s a lot of cash. Is Beil right that the system is "self funded" by employee contributions and "it’s the money of the workers that funds it?" About the system We started with data compiled by the state Department of Employee Trust Funds, which administers the retirement plan for 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers. For 2010, the latest year available, revenues flowing into the pension fund totalled $9.78 billion -- 85 percent of which came from investment returns on the fund. That’s pretty typical of the fund’s experience. Over the past decade, except for a couple years when stock market losses wiped out any revenue gain, investment income has averaged 76 percent of the annual revenue. But what about all the money that generated the returns? When and where did it come from? For 2010, nearly all of the remaining 15 percent came from the employers who are part of the fund -- the state, school districts and most local units of government, based on collective bargaining agreements. But, wait, didn’t Walker limit collective bargaining and require the state and its employees to begin making identical contributions to the fund? Yes, but that didn’t kick in until 2011, so it has had little impact on the sources of the $77 billion in the fund, and it had no impact on the fund as of 2010. What’s relevant for this fact check is what the law was before Act 10. Here’s the history on where contributions to the fund came from. Dating to at least the 1940s, Wisconsin law has made both workers and the state responsible for contributing to the pension fund in amounts based on flat percentages or actuarial calculations related to keeping the fund healthy. Indeed, the state’s books still show a cost-sharing arrangement. But the statutes, since at least 1981, have allowed or dictated that the state cover some or all of the workers’ contributions in addition to the employer share. This was the era of collective bargaining. And that’s what happened. It became commonplace over a period of decades for almost all public employers -- the state, school districts, local governments -- to "pick up" the entire employee contribution. So, looking simply at the numbers, it’s clear the vast majority of funds in the pension system are from investment returns and taxpayer-funded contributions by employers. By that measure, Beil’s claim of a "self funded" pension system is way off the mark, given that few employees were making a direct contribution to the fund before 2011. Another high-ranking AFSCME official in Wisconsin, Susan McMurray, a lobbyist with AFSCME Council 11, agreed that "self funded" is not an accurate description. "It doesn’t really work like that," she said. "It’s not a 401(k). It’s a different mechanism." Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed: "The pension is an important part of compensation, but to say the employer is not contributing to the cost, that’s not really defensible." More to the story But that’s not the end of the story. Pensions are an integral part of an employee’s compensation package. In effect, it is money set aside now to be available when the worker retires. "It’s not like they’re giving it to us," said McMurray, who spoke for Beil. This point of view was advocated during the original collective bargaining debate by financial journalist David Cay Johnston. "The money the state ‘contributes’ is actually part of the compensation that has been negotiated with state workers in advance so it is their money that they choose to take as pension payments in the future rather than cash wages or other benefits today," Johnston wrote in a 2011 article for Tax.com. Others argue the exact opposite. "One could equally say that 100 percent of Wisconsin pensions are funded by taxpayers, since taxpayers are the sole source of income for public sector workers, including the portion of their salaries that are deducted to meet pension contributions," The Economist magazine’s Buttonwood column argued in February 2011. Asked if unions feel they gave up the same amount in foregone wage increases as they received in pension improvements, AFSCME’s McMurray said they have not documented the relationship. Joshua Rauh, a Northwestern University finance professor who tracks pension costs, told us he doubted any serious economist would dispute the tradeoff, but the extent of the wage giveback is debatable. "The answer is certainly not that 100 percent of the benefit was paid for by employees through lower wages," he said. If the system is "self-funded" as Biel claimed, what happens when investment returns lag? Critics say the taxpayer is on the hook when contributions are required beyond beyond those funded in the planned compensation package. In reality that hasn’t happened -- but only because the laws were written so that the employer contribution was open-ended. It’s important to note that in bad times, many retirees get a smaller pension, too -- unlike pensioners in other states. Our rating Beil said the Wisconsin Retirement System for public employees is "a self-funded pension plan" and "it’s the money of the workers’ that funds it." There’s an element of truth in his statement, in that workers for years made trade-offs in collective bargaining that to some unknown extent paid for the pension contribution their employers agreed to pick up. Even the state’s accounting system continued to show an annual worker contribution. But Beil’s "self-funded" remark leaves the strong misimpression that taxpayers have little or no skin in the game, when, in fact, taxpayers have been the major source of the money in the pension fund. We rate Biel’s claim Mostly False.	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2012-07-04T09:00:00	2012-06-14	['None']

pomt-12103	"We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-us-net-energy-exporte/	In a 75-minute rally speech that revisited his response to the Charlottesville, Va., unrest and scolded the national media, President Donald Trump slid in a note of pride about the United States’ balance of trade in energy. "We're going to do an infrastructure bill," Trump said. "We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land. Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life. American hands will build this future. American energy will power this future. We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently." Was he correct to say that the United States has "become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently"? Short answer: No. But to get to the short answer, you have to wade through several possible interpretations of what Trump meant. (The White House did not clarify his meaning for us.) First possible meaning: The U.S. has just begun exporting energy One way to read Trump’s statement is to take it literally -- that the United States only recently began to export energy. This is flat wrong. "We have been exporting coal, natural gas, electricity, refined products and energy technologies for a very long time," said Paul Sullivan, a professor at National Defense University and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who specializes in energy security issues. "We were once, during the time of JD Rockefeller, the world's near monopoly on kerosene. Liquefied natural gas exports from Alaska to Japan have been around for a long time. Piped gas to Mexico and Canada are normal events. We have a massive electricity trade with Canada." Second possible meaning: The U.S. is now a net energy exporter Trump might have meant that the United States had only recently become a net exporter of energy -- meaning the total of all U.S. energy exports recently overtook the total of all U.S. energy imports. This is less wrong, but still not accurate. "This has been falling, but we are still a huge net energy importer," said Jason Bordoff, who directs Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In its most recent projections, the federal Energy Information Administration concluded that the United States would become a net energy exporter around 2026, depending on the course of future patterns of global supply, demand and pricing. What’s clear is that the United States has not yet become a net exporter of energy, as Trump’s past-tense remark indicated. If that day comes in 2026 -- and it may or may not -- that would be two years after Trump finishes a possible second term. Third possible meaning: U.S. crude oil export ban lifted Perhaps rather than "energy," Trump meant to say "crude oil." If this is what Trump meant, the statement would still be problematic. It wouldn’t be the first time "ever." And the relevant change was signed under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. On Dec. 18, 2015, the United States enacted legislation to repeal a ban on most crude-oil exports that had been in place since the energy-crisis days of 1975. (Exports of refined petroleum were not blocked by the law, just crude.) Here’s a chart showing U.S. crude-oil exports going back to the 1980s. (The years between 1975 and 2015 show some export activity because trade with some countries, such as Canada, was exempt from the law.) The rapid rise in crude-oil exports near the end of the chart reflects the lifting of the export-restriction law. Other possible meanings It’s possible to substitute any number of energy subcategories into Trump’s remark to see whether they make the statement more accurate. Some do, some don’t. The United States has been a net coal exporter for many years. It has been a net exporter of refined petroleum products since around 2011. So neither of those would make Trump correct. Natural gas is a more promising option. The United States is not yet a net exporter of natural gas, but the difference between imports and exports has narrowed for nine consecutive years, according to EIA, falling to its smallest gap ever in 2016. And the agency projects that the United States will become a net exporter of natural gas once the 2017 numbers are tallied up. Energy experts say that this is a significant development, though one that Trump can take little credit for. "It has been a trend that was activated by the U.S. shale boom and made possible by the Obama administration's policy on liquefied natural gas exports," said Anna Mikulska, a fellow with Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. Ironically, Bordoff added, a different Trump policy goal -- reviewing Obama-era increases in fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles -- could make it harder for the United States to become a net exporter of energy, the very thing he applauded in Phoenix. "Trump’s stated intention to ease fuel economy standards actually undermines the goal of becoming a net energy exporter, because it means the U.S. will be consuming more oil than we would otherwise," he said. "The EIA projections assume the planned increases in fuel economy go into effect, so the EIA projection of when we become a net exporter of energy would be pushed further out if we weaken fuel economy standards." Our ruling Trump said that "we have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently." This statement is problematic regardless of how you interpret his statement -- gross energy exports, net energy exports, gross crude-oil exports, and net natural gas exports. The closest he would come to being accurate is if he were referring to net natural gas exports, but even there, it hasn’t happened yet, contrary to what his past-tense statement indicates. We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-08-23T17:15:52	2017-08-22	['None']
pomt-06482	Says he’s "never asked for more" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/16/david-clarke-jr/clarke-says-hes-never-asked-more-inflationary-incr/	David A. Clarke Jr. wants you to know that Chris Abele is not the new sheriff in town. Clarke, the Milwaukee County sheriff since 2002, was spitting bullets when Abele -- the successor to former Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker -- proposed balancing the 2012 county budget in large part by cutting deeply into Clarke’s agency. Abele is a "novice" with "disdain for law and order" and a desire to "coddle criminals," Clarke said on the Sept. 30, 2011 "Midday with Charlie Sykes" show on WTMJ-AM (620). Abele, the sheriff went on, proposes "gutting" the Sheriff’s Department. The sheriff said he was very careful with taxpayer dollars, dating back to the Walker era, then added something that caught our ear. "I never asked for additional resources. I never asked for more," Clarke said. "Every budget I’ve ever asked for is just a cost to continue. In other words, what we’re doing now, I’m satisfied with the money that you gave us last year. If you just give us that again, with the rate of inflation because salaries go up and all those kind of things, I said, ‘I’m fine.’ He continued: "And even with that, the (County Board) would turn around and take some money away. But you know, I can live with that. I don’t run the budget and I realize the finances are not infinite. The county’s in bad shape, I understand that." We’re aware of Clarke’s past efforts to streamline the department and rein in overtime payments that before his arrival had routinely helped bust the budget. But did Clarke really confine himself -- every year -- to asking for inflationary increases? Let’s frame this dispute -- and then take a look at the numbers. Abele praises the Sheriff’s Department’s role but says that "by statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency." That’s the reason for the cuts, Abele told the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011. Clarke is outspoken in his criticism of liberal elected officials, and sees Abele as just that. Plus, Abele’s misinformed about public safety, Clarke says. In particular, Clarke took shots at Abele’s bold decision to try to direct Clarke to make specific cuts. That usurps the sheriff’s constitutional powers, Clarke argues. Now the numbers. Part of this is simple math. County records document what Clarke asked for each year compared with the adopted budget handed to him the year before. We looked at 10 budgets, from Clarke’s first in 2003 to the proposal he made for 2012. We found that in five years, his requests topped the previous year -- while in five years he asked for less or about the same. When he sought more, the increases ranged from 4 percent up to 13 percent. In every case through 2010, those increases were greater than inflation, based on the consumer price index for Milwaukee-Racine calculated by the U.S. Department of Labor. The government has not yet calculated 2011 rates. Seems cut and dried. But nothing involving Milwaukee County’s often-arcane and cumbersome budgeting process is simple, so we took a second look and talked to the sheriff and other county officials. First, Clarke. Through his budget officials, Clarke didn’t dispute that the county records, on their face, will show larger-than-inflation increases. But he said he is using a different standard: budget increases minus the costs for employee benefits. The different standard, of course, provides a different picture. Unless you’ve been been stuck in the deep tunnel for the past decade, you probably have some notion that skyrocketing pension costs after the notorious 2002 pension deal -- plus hyper-generous health insurance for county workers -- have driven up county costs and taxes dramatically. "As the County has downsized, the ‘legacy’ fringe benefits (obligations for those not still working here) have been spread across fewer employees. The health care and pension cost increases have been everybody's problem," said Stephen Cady, the County Board’s fiscal and budget analyst. "Each year, departments have had to cut to absorb the growing fringe costs that get allocated to their department." Those fringe benefit costs are from active employees, too, not just retirees. Clarke says that if you remove those fringe costs, his budget requests collectively have come in under the inflation rate. He’s right -- at least when you compare inflation through 2010 (latest year available) to Clarke’s first eight budgets. But the inflation comparison works against him if you include 2011, when his request went up 13.4 percent. In that year, we should note, an accounting change involving Clarke’s bailiffs explained a big chunk of the increase. It’s not surprising that Clarke’s budgets look better by his definition: He’s removed one of the leading -- if not the leading -- inflationary driver in the county budget from his calculations. That issue affects all departments. "This is the cost of doing business," said Abele spokesman Jeff Bentoff. "Every department is responsible for the fringe costs associated with their employees." Indeed, other departments did not get the benefit of property tax-levy increases the Sheriff’s Department has seen. Abele says the department’s levy has gone up 62 percent in the decade, while Clarke says 37 percent is a fairer number. Either way it’s a big bump compared, for example, with the zero percent increase for the Parks Department, or the drop in levy for transit. Clarke has trimmed about one in five positions from his agency, thereby eliminating some employee fringe benefit costs. But that underscores he does have some control over those costs. In any case, Clarke’s leave-out-the-benefits approach is not the conventional way the budget is viewed. Nor did he note that limitation when he made the ear-catching statement. What’s more, if we looked at every department that way, tens of millions of dollars in county tax dollars would magically disappear from the books -- but not from that tax bill in your mailbox. Our conclusion Clarke says he "never asked for more" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff. It’s true if you overlook the massive fringe benefit increases that have pushed up county costs, frustrating Clarke and every other department head who cut back only to see costs rise. But the bottom line is, Clarke’s redefinition of his budget requests is unofficial and not recorded in county records. We rate his statement False.	None	David A.

pomt-09310	"We had a press conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media covered."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/19/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-mainstream-media-didnt-cover-a/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, hailed by many conservatives who see Democrats in Washington as trampling on states' rights, told an interviewer for the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine last week that his public endorsement of a 2009 Texas House resolution on state sovereignty was not covered by mainstream news organizations. Perry said: “We had a press conference here that interestingly no one in the mainstream media covered." We wondered if Perry accurately recapped the April 9, 2009, news conference at which he endorsed a concurrent resolution authored by state Rep. Brandon Creighton stating the Legislature claims "sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States." Perry’s office didn’t respond to our request for elaboration on the media presence at the press conference. Next, we found indications the news conference was covered by at least two media outlets -- the Austin American-Statesman and the Associated Press. Currently, more than 100 Texas newspapers and more than 150 Texas broadcast outlets are AP members and get its dispatches, according to Dale Leach, AP's Dallas bureau chief. Leach said the AP distributed five photos taken by a staff photographer who attended the press conference. The 246-word AP report on the press conference, sent out at 5:53 p.m. that day, quotes Perry saying: “I believe that our federal government has become oppressive. I believe it's become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into the lives of our citizens and its interference with the affairs of our state.” The article also states: “Answering a question from a news reporter, Perry suggested that (U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey) Hutchison,” then poised to challenge Perry in the 2010 GOP primary for governor, “is part of the federal government's expansion.” Our hunch: The mentioned reporter was Ken Herman, then a staff writer in the Austin American-Statesman’s Capitol bureau. Herman posted a blog and video from Perry’s press conference at 3:10 p.m. the same day; both remain online. According to the video, Perry took questions from Herman, who asked if Perry included Hutchison among active participants in expanding federal powers. Perry said she'd be among individuals in that category. Herman also asked if Perry could specify ways Hutchison had supported expansions in federal powers. “I’ll get you the long and distinguished list of those shortly,” Perry said. We found one Statesman news article that could explain why Perry says no one from the mainstream media covered the press conference. The article by Jason Embry of the Statesman’s Capitol staff -- published a week after the event -- states that Perry's remarks gave him a bounce in national attention even though the resolution itself “barely drew a mention in the print editions of the state’s daily newspapers” the day after the press conference. So, how does Perry’s recap stand up? The AP and the Statesman are clearly part of the mainstream media. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-13374	Say photographs of Hillary Clinton at the debate show what could be an earpiece.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/28/blog-posting/claims-hillary-clinton-wore-earpiece-debate-dont-h/	The Internet had lots of questions about the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here’s one of them: Was Clinton wearing an earpiece? "Has Hillary Been Caught Cheating (Again)?" asked Charisma News, a Christian political website. "Was Hillary Wired for Trump Debate?" asked the conservative website World Net Daily. The U.K.-based Express website summarized, "Did Hillary Clinton wear an earpiece to CHEAT the US debate? Conspiracy theory sweeps web." It’s not the first time Clinton has faced such suggestions. As Snopes.com has noted, some questioned whether Clinton had been wearing one at NBC’s commander-in-chief forum on Sept. 7. Snopes concluded that there was "nothing unusual" and what viewers were seeing "most likely captured a light source temporarily reflecting on Clinton's ear." A reader suggested we check out what happened at the first debate -- an even higher-profile event with upward of 80 million Americans watching. So we will. (Snopes gave a False rating to a related claim that Clinton had a bulge in the back of her jacket at the debate that could have been a "coughing prevention machine.") The original post, at Charisma News, said the device "was meant to match her skin tone almost perfectly." The article speculated that the device could be a hearing aid, an "inductive earpiece" used by actors to better hear cues, or an "anti-seizure device." "None of these paint a particularly good picture for the Democratic presidential nominee. Either she has an as-yet undisclosed health condition, ranging from mild to severe, or she's been cheating during the televised debates," the article says. For the record, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told PolitiFact that Clinton "was not wearing an earpiece." Asked whether she has a hearing aid, he said, "No." So, let’s take a look at the original evidence offered -- a Reuters photo and an enlargement that some say show the suspicious, fleshy bulge in Clinton’s ear. To be honest, we don’t see any device in this image. (What’s more flesh-like than flesh itself?) But we decided to look at some other images in our wire service archive to see if anything else made her ear look unusual. When we reached out to Charisma News, an editor suggested that we contact the author of the article. We emailed him the images, but we did not hear back. Image 1 (Damon Winter/New York Times) Close-up Image 2 (Doug Mills/New York Times) Close-up Image 3 (Associated Press/David Goldman) Close-up Image 4 (Associated Press/David Goldman) Close-up In these four close-ups, we see nothing that mirrors what the original Reuters image showed (which, again, didn’t even look like a device to us). We just see a lot of ear flesh. When we ran these images by Richard Quindry, a Philadelphia-area photographic and Photoshop expert, he said that only image 2 could even potentially show anything -- the narrow white form inside the ear canal. But even saying that that shape is something other than skin would be speculative at best, he said. Each of the other images -- as well as the original Reuters image -- show "nothing" to support a claim that she used an earpiece, Quindry said. Our ruling Internet claims suggested that a debate photograph of Clinton showed her wearing an earpiece. Neither the original photograph presented as evidence nor other enlargements of photographs taken at the debate show anything that looks like an earpiece or a hearing aid. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14782	"There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-700000-americans-could-be-affecte/	Democrats’ proposed legislation to stop terrorists from buying guns would unintentionally harm the Second Amendment rights of everyday Americans, said presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio and other Senate Republicans voted down legislation that allowed the attorney general to ban "known or suspected dangerous terrorists" from obtaining firearms or explosives. Under current law, thousands of people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list have been able to purchase such weapons legally. But the terrorist watch list sometimes includes people who aren’t actually terrorists, Rubio said on CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 6, and it would be wrong to deny those people their right to own a gun. "If these were perfect lists, that would be one thing," he said. "But there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured under this amendment the Democrats offered. And that's the problem." We wondered if there were really 700,000 Americans who could potentially get caught up on a terrorist watch list and be prevented from buying guns under Democratic legislation. Rubio’s count is way off. The number of Americans on the consolidated terrorist watch list is likely in the thousands, not hundreds of thousands. We reached out to Rubio’s team, but they didn’t get back to us. By the numbers The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center maintains what is colloquially known as the terrorist watch list. The Terrorist Screening Database is a consolidated collection of information about people known or reasonably suspected to have some level of involvement in terrorist activities. The no-fly list is a subset of the terrorist watch list. The terrorist watch list is the one the attorney general would pull from when deciding whether someone should be denied a firearm if there’s reasonable belief that the person would use that firearm for terrorism, under the Democrats’ bill, said Ashley Schapitl, spokeswoman for bill sponsor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The terrorist watch list pulls information from numerous government agencies in the United States and around the world, so American citizens and legal residents only make up a portion of the list. A pretty small portion, in fact. A Terrorist Screening Center spokesman declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. The no-fly list subset included about 16,000 names, only 500 of whom were Americans. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000, the number Rubio cited. But there’s no way that the number of Americans on the list has grown to 700,000, said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. "Rubio is almost certainly off by orders of magnitude," said Edgar, now a visiting fellow at Brown University. The number of Americans on the list likely doesn’t exceed 10,000, said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. Some innocent people have been wrongly included in the terrorist watch list or the no-fly list, which can affect their lives in ways such as having to go through extra airport security or being stopped from boarding a plane. But for an American to get on that list by accident is "harder than people think," added Reardon, who is now a vice president at the Soufan Group, a consulting firm. It’s more likely that a person would have the same name as someone who is on the list, and that person could run into problems at the airport if a security agent makes a misidentification, Reardon said. This happened to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who once wasn’t allowed to fly because he had a similar name to the alias of a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. But the problem of same names is less common than it used to be, and there is a reasonably efficient redress process for people to appeal to the government to get their name removed from the terrorist watch list, Edgar noted. "That shows that the redress process is not a sham, but it also shows that a fairly significant number of people are put on the watchlist by mistake," he said. Still, it’s nowhere close to 700,000 Americans. Our ruling Rubio said, "There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the attorney general would have some discretion in denying firearms to people on the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watchlist. While it’s reasonable to estimate that there are 700,000 people on this list, only a small fraction are American citizens or legal residents. Experts said it’s likely that only about 10,000 are Americans, while the rest are foreigners. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-00021	Says "Kurt Russell supports Trump" by wearing a Trump T-shirt.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/photo-kurt-russell-trump-t-shirt-doctored/	An old photo of actors Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn is resurfacing claiming that Russell "supports Trump." The photo, posted on May 9, 2016, to the Facebook page "Florida Firefighters for TRUMP," shows Russell and Hawn walking down the sidewalk, holding hands and wearing shirts with American flags and "Trump 2016." Russell’s shirt shows a photo of Trump holding a gun and references the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, more commonly known as ISIS. "We’re Gonna Knock the Hell Outta ISIS," the shirt reads. The caption with the photo also names "Stephen (The Bull) McCaffrey," a reference to the 1991 film "Backdraft" in which Russell plays a Chicago firefighter. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim. An image search shows the photo is doctored. The photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in — only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts. It’s not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts. An image recently circulated on Facebook with a quote from Russell praising Trump. We rated that Pants on Fire.

pomt-12684	Blue Cross Blue Shield ended "2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/kathleen-sebelius/florida-blue-ended-2016-1-million-members-obamacar/	Democrats have ripped apart the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, arguing that it will take away insurance from millions of Americans. Kathleen Sebelius defended President Barack Obama’s health care law, which she helped implement, in a March 12 interview on Meet the Press. The former head of Health and Human Services pointed to the experience of one of the main insurers in Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is headed by CEO Pat Geraghty, as a success story. "Florida has not been a welcoming state to this law. Pat Geraghty ended up 2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace and as a company in the black. He said, ‘Of course this works. We can make it work. We can go forward.’ " We decided to fact-check Sebelius’ claim about the number of Floridians who enrolled through the federal health care law in spite of Republican efforts against it, including from Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to repeal it. Florida Blue enrollment Blue Cross Blue Shield operates under the name Florida Blue in the Sunshine State. The insurer’s enrollment rose in recent years through the Affordable Care Act, said Paul Kluding, a company spokesman. At the end of the open enrollment season on Jan. 31, 2017, Florida Blue had 940,000 ACA members -- an increase from 715,000 in 2016. Florida Blue anticipated an increase because some other insurers, such as UnitedHealthCare and Aetna, exited the marketplace where consumers can shop for policies. "The number fluctuates throughout the year, but historically the enrollment numbers actually increase within the few months following the open enrollment close date, so that number will probably rise slightly over the next couple of months," Kluding said. Florida Blue sells plans in all Florida counties and is the largest insurer participating in the federal marketplace in Florida. With all insurers combined, about 1.7 million Floridians enrolled through the federal health care law for 2017. So Florida Blue is the largest insurer on the marketplace. Sebelius and Geraghty both attended an annual health care conference at the University of Miami on March 3. At the conference, Kluding said, Geraghty told Sebelius "that the company is now serving approximately 1 million individual members, and that Florida Blue has operated this ACA business profitably." Florida Blue made a small profit in the ACA market -- a single-digit positive margin, Kluding said. Sebelius’ number about Florida Blue enrollment was close to the actual figure. But she is cherry-picking an example of an insurer that had success in a particular state. Michael Tanner, a health policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that there are vast differences in how insurers fared in various states. While Florida Blue may have done well, it’s counterpart in North Carolina "did terribly," he said. In North Carolina, Blue Cross lost $405 million on medical expenses for ACA customers in 2014 and 2015 but stayed in the marketplace for 2017. The majority of Blue Cross insurers in the states are non-profits, making comparisons to other providers difficult. "It's a little bit apples and oranges to compare Blues to other insurers -- they have a special non- profit status, and they are not taxed the same way. They have the largest market shares and historically being the insurer of last resort, their pool didn’t change as radically as a lot of other insurance companies did," Tanner said. While Florida Blue has seen rising enrollment, some other insurers have scaled back offering plans on the exchange in Florida or have exited the market entirely. (Half of the insurers doing business in Florida offer plans on the exchange.) UnitedHealthCare and Aetna exited the individual market, although Aetna is still writing off-exchange plans, said Amy Bogner, a spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Humana withdrew from 31 of the 38 counties in the individual market in Florida and canceled all off-exchange business. In August, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini blamed a pre-tax loss of more than $430 million since January 2014 for the decision. Our ruling Sebelius said Blue Cross Blue Shield ended "2016 open enrollment with 1 million members in the Florida marketplace." Her number is close. Florida Blue said 940,000 people enrolled as of Jan. 31, and the insurer expects the number to rise.

pomt-04818	Says she does the jobs of state auditor, secretary of state and lieutenant governor "for less than the price of one of them" in Washington state.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/aug/17/kate-brown/oregons-secretary-state-three-one-deal/	Oregon’s Secretary of State Kate Brown likes to talk about saving money. The last time we checked out something she said, she was touting the savings her audit division had dug up. More recently, she talked about what a steal Oregon’s secretary of state position is, noting that it’s basically three jobs in one. "Our neighbor to the north, the state of Washington, they elect a lieutenant governor, a secretary of state and a state auditor," Brown said in a May television interview. "I basically do all three of those jobs for less than the price of one of them." This wasn’t the first time we’d heard Brown say something along these lines, so we thought it was worth checking out. To be sure, Brown’s position as secretary of state is unique. She’s the only secretary of state in the nation who oversees an audit division -- we got that verified by Leslie Reynolds, the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State. (Her source was the 2010 Book of the States, which we also double checked.) Oregon is also one of five states that don’t have a lieutenant governor -- and one of three in which the secretary of state is next in line in case of a vacancy. We also did a quick salary check to see if Brown has her numbers right, and it seems she does, according to public documents from both states. Excluding benefits and such, Brown makes $72,000 a year as Oregon’s secretary of state. Meanwhile, Washington pays its state auditor $116,950 a year, its lieutenant governor $110,831 and its secretary of state $119,222. Now that all seemed fair, but we wondered whether Brown really picks up all the slack for those two missing positions. That’s a little less clear. Let’s start with the lieutenant governor position. We called up Brian Dirks, the spokesman for Washington’s Lt. Gov. Brad Owen. Dirks said the office only has two constitutional duties: Filling in for the governor in her absence and serving as president of the state senate. In Oregon, Brown is responsible for the first, but not the second. Sen. Peter Courtney is the president of Oregon’s Senate -- he has been for nearly a decade. Dirks also noted that Owen sits on 15 to 20 different committees, including the state finance committee, and focuses on both international relations and economic development. Those sorts of things are not part of Brown’s job. Next up was the state auditor. We made a call to Mindy Chambers, the spokeswoman for Washington State Auditor Brian Sonntag, who explained that the state auditor doesn’t actually do much auditing himself. Instead, he "sets the overall tone for the office." He also assigns special projects, speaks publicly on behalf of the auditing office and works on open-government issues. In Oregon, Brown does oversee the audit division and she’s responsible for selecting its director -- currently Gary Blackmer -- but beyond that she doesn’t have much of a role. Blackmer seems to us to be the better foil for Washington’s Sonntag. Like Sonntag, he doesn’t actually perform audits, but he does put together a list of proposed audits. Blackmer also keeps track of what’s happening with the given audits moving through the division. His day is filled with meetings, budget discussions, editing duties and several other responsibilities. He also pulls in double what Brown makes a year -- and more than any of the Washington officials. To be fair, Blackmer runs his list of proposed audits by Brown for her approval. She also says she selected him specifically because he "understood my vision for the office." Specifically, Oregon had a strong fiscal auditing history before Brown was elected, so she made it a point to have Blackmer beef up the performance audit side. So, when Brown said she’s a threefer, essentially doing in one role what Washington elects three people to do, she’s technically correct. She selects the chief auditor, she is typically seen as the de facto lieutenant governor and, of course, she is Oregon’s secretary of state. But once you drill down to specific duties, that statement is less accurate. You’ll find that she doesn’t exactly do in Oregon what the lieutenant governor does in Washington, other than potentially filling in for the governor. You’ll also note that the state audit director has a much more hands-on supervisory role than does Brown. In terms of the finances, the savings are also dubious. If you don’t count what our Senate president makes -- less than $40,000 a year -- Brown and Blackmer come at a cost of $216,000 to the state. Washington pays out $345,000 for its three officials. That’s not exactly a one-for-three deal. Brown says she uses the threefer pitch mostly as a way to indicate that Oregon has a lean state government. "I think it's fair to say the three for one is not an apples to apples comparison," she said. "I think it's particularly compelling in that it sort of lets Oregonians know what a lean sort of operating machine Oregon state government is when you compare us to other states." We think her general gist is accurate, Oregon gets by with fewer elected officials. But the statement that she does three jobs for the price of one ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13251	Says Hillary Clinton was "let off the hook" for her email scandal while Gen. David Petraeus had his life "destroyed for doing far, far less."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/18/donald-trump/fbi-director-james-comey-says-donald-trump-has-it-/	Donald Trump has declared repeatedly that Hillary Clinton should be imprisoned over her email. Emails on her unsecured personal email server were found to have contained classified information despite her repeated insistence that all the material was unclassified. His evidence: other public officials, including David Petraeus, a former CIA director and a leading general in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been punished for far less. During a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally Oct. 13, Trump mentioned FBI Director James Comey, who decided that Clinton's actions did not rise to the level of prosecution. Trump said that Comey "let her off the hook while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less. This is a conspiracy against you the American people and we cannot let this happen or continue." Trump has made similar comments before, which we’ve looked at in another report. But this time there is more information publicly available about the information practices of both Petreaus and Clinton. ​So we decided to compare the two cases for the Truth-O-Meter. We're relying on Comey's statements because they were made under oath before two congressional committees, and he is one of the few people familiar with the circumstances and the secrets involved in both cases who is able to speak on the record. Comey’s initial testimony Petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling confidential materials. He was fined $100,000 and given two years probation. He had given his mistress, Paula Broadwell, access to eight notebooks with top-secret and code information. She had made copies of over 300 documents marked "secret." In addition, Petraeus lied to FBI agents investigating the case. In Clinton's case, the FBI found 110 emails with classified information on her server, eight of which were designated top secret. Comey, in a July 5 news conference, said there was no evidence of Clinton or her staff intending to violate the law. But he also said Clinton should have known that her handling of the emails was inappropriate, and that her behavior was "extremely reckless" because outsiders could hack her server. The FBI director was asked about the Clinton-Petraeus comparison during his July 7 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. "Do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, 'Got in trouble for far less,' end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-MD. "No, it's the reverse," the FBI director said. Comey cited the Petraeus case as one that "illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute. Even there, they prosecuted him for a misdemeanor. "In that case, you had vast quantities of highly classified information, including special sensitive compartmented information. That's the reference to code words. (A) vast quantity of it, not only shared with someone without authority to have it, but we found it in a search warrant hidden under the insulation in his attic, and then he lied to us about it during the investigation," Comey said. (Later in the hearing, Comey said his staff had corrected him and the notebooks were found in Petraeus' desk, not his attic.) "So you have obstruction of justice, you have intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of information," Comey said. "He admitted he knew that was the wrong thing to do. That is a perfect illustration of the kind of cases that get prosecuted. In my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this (Clinton) case." "And General Petraeus did not admit to these facts when the FBI investigators first interviewed him, did he?" Cummings asked. "No," Comey said, "he lied about it." Comey's subsequent testimony Eighty three days later, Comey was called before the House Judiciary Committee where Republicans tried to get him to change his mind about prosecuting Clinton, and Blake Farenthold, R-Tex., brought up the matter again. Farenthold: "How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how (the) average American would be treated. This is only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?" Comey: "When people tell you that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases because — I'm a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor — I have gone back through 40 years of cases, and I'm telling you under oath that to prosecute on these facts would be a double standard, because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts." Comey said that, at the FBI, if an agent uses an unclassified email system to do business and, while on that system, talks about classified topics "you will be in big trouble with the FBI. I'm highly confident of that. I'm also confident, in fact certain, you would not be prosecuted. That's what folks tend to lump together. So I care deeply about what people think about the justice system and that it not have two standards. It does not, and this demonstrates it." Steven Aftergood, senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on national security secrecy, said, "FBI Director Comey's conclusions have unique weight because he was in a position to investigate and assess both cases in depth. The rest of us (including Trump) have to rely on what has been publicly reported or speculated upon. To me, Comey's conclusion is the end of the matter." Finally, it's worth noting that during the Oct. 4, 2016, vice presidential debate, a variant of the theme came up as Republican Mike Pence said, "If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did . . . they'd be court-martialed." Democrat Tim Kaine said, "That is absolutely false, and you know that." The Washington Post Fact Checker, after noting that Clinton's Cabinet-level position made this an apples-to-oranges comparison, consulted about a dozen retired military lawyers and found there was no absolute answer at all. "What we found was that it’s absolutely unclear, and is subject to prosecutorial discretion and the circumstances of each case," the Post reported. "Technically, yes, a service member can be court-martialed for behavior like Clinton’s, but it’s more likely the person would face administrative action. And the administrative action would depend on each service member’s disciplinary history, the evidence available and prosecutorial discretion." We contacted several people at the Trump campaign noting Comey's testimony and asked for Trump's evidence. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump said Clinton was "let off the hook" for her email scandal "while other lives, including General Petraeus and many others, have been destroyed for doing far, far less." The director of the FBI director, the man who has intimate knowledge of both cases, has repeatedly insisted under oath that the reverse is true. Petraeus’ case was worse because he intentionally passed a large amount of classified information to an unauthorized person and then lied about it to the FBI.

pomt-13523	The number of illegal immigrants "could be 3 million. It could be 30 million."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-about-30-mil/	In a major policy speech on immigration, Donald Trump criticized the government’s approach to the undocumented population, sayings the feds don’t even know the scope of the problem. "Honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million," Trump said. "They have no idea what the number is. Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks." Trump questioned the 11 million figure early in his presidential bid last year, and floated 30 million and 34 million as alternative estimates. That claim rates Pants on Fire. Is it possible that, a year later, Trump’s claim of 3 million or 30 million is more accurate? The answer is still no. Estimating the undocumented The U.S. Homeland Security Department last estimated the size of the undocumented immigrant population at 11.4 million in January 2012, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. This count includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who overstayed their visas. Figures from independent organizations that study immigration are all in the same ballpark. Here’s a rundown: Unauthorized population size (2012) Unauthorized population size (latest year) Dept. of Homeland Security 11.4 million Pew Research Center 11.2 million 11.3 million (2014) Center for Migration Studies 11.1 million 10.9 million (2014) Center for Immigration Studies 11 to 12 million 11.7 million (2016)* *This is a preliminary estimate. All of these figures come from subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census. Researchers at all of the organizations told us Trump’s statement is wildly inaccurate. There is "absolutely zero possibility" for the number to be just 3 million or as many as 30 million," according to Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank. "There is strong evidence that the number is 11 million, with a plausible margin of error of plus or minus 1 million," he said. Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Research Center, called both of Trump’s numbers "virtually impossible" and explained why. On the low end, survey data shows large enough foreign-born populations and legal admissions that there could not be as few as 3 million people. The high-end of Trump’s offered estimate is contradicted by the limited number of housing units in the United States, Mexico and Central America’s census data and surveys’ size, and U.S. data on admissions and departures. "There’s simply no way for an additional 20 million people to be in the country and have escaped detection," Passel said. If the figure really is as high as 30 million, school enrollment and birth registration would reflect that, as both public schooling and birthright citizenship are incentives for undocumented immigrants, pointed out Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigrants. "But the numbers are not out of whack," Camarota said. "Bottom line is we don’t know what the number is for sure. But based on the available evidence, it seems very unlikely that it’s 20 million (more)." Why it’s ‘always’ 11 million Trump suggested he was skeptical of the 11 million figure because it’s "always" been the estimate. Experts told us there’s a good explanation for that: a steady flow of people coming in and leaving. "The reason that he has heard the same number for years is that the population has not been growing," said Warren. "There’s enormous churn in the illegal immigration population. Hundreds of thousands come in at 11 million and then hundreds of thousands leave," Camarota said, adding that the undocumented population is a demographically unusual group as it can’t grow by births (as all children born in the United States are citizens). But even if you folded in these citizen children, the number would be 17 million at most, he said. While the federal estimate hasn’t been updated in a few years, experts agreed that the outside groups’ calculations are sound. Still, Camarota criticized the government for not providing a more recent figure. "This creates enormous uncertainty in a debate about an important policy issue. It’s like saying, ‘We should do something about the deficit, but we don’t know how big it is,’ " he said. "We talk about something that everyone perceives is a problem without any data." Our ruling Trump said the number of illegal immigrants "could be 3 million. It could be 30 million." Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million. The figure has "always" been 11 million, in recent years, because of the flow of undocumented immigrants in and out of the United States.

pomt-10096	McCain is "selectively editing Joe Biden's words...Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/28/barack-obama/campaigns-volley-over-bidens-warning/	Sen. Barack Obama plays defense in a new television ad , alleging that in a previous ad Sen. John McCain's campaign "selectively edits" the words of Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden. The only problem is the Obama ad – which the campaign released Oct. 27, 2008, in the Northern Virginia market – at a minimum employs, um, selective editing. Let's unravel this tangled web of selectivity to see who's being dishonest, beginning with the McCain ad that started the volley. "Listen to Joe Biden talking about what electing Barack Obama will mean," the narrator says. Then we hear an audio recording of Biden at a recent fundraiser: "Mark my words: It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama," we hear Biden say, as sinister music plays over images of hooded gunmen, and hostile foreign leaders. "The world is looking. We're going to have an international crisis to test the mettle of this guy. I guarantee you it's gonna happen." "It doesn't have to happen," the narrator continues. "Vote McCain." Those comments by Biden are lifted from a talk he gave to campaign contributors at Seattle's Sheraton Hotel on Oct. 19, 2008. Are they a fair representation of Biden's point of view? To find out we have to look at Biden's remarks in more context – a good deal of context, in fact. "Barack is the right guy at the right moment for this job," he said. He riffed on foreign affairs a bit, then continued: "Barack gets it...And I'll tell you why I'm telling you this: because we're going to find ourselves in real trouble when we get elected...We're gonna have the largest systemic deficit in modern – not modern – in the history of the world...So there are going to be a lot of tough decisions Barack's gonna have to make, a lot of very tough decisions, including on foreign policy. And here's the point I want to make: mark my words. Mark my words. It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy. The world is looking. We're about to elect a brilliant 47-year-old president of the United States of America. Remember I said it standing here if you don't remember anything else I said. Watch, we're gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy...we're gonna need you to use your influence, your influence in the community, to stand with him. Because it's not gonna be apparent initially, it's not gonna be apparent that we're right. Because all these decisions, all these decisions, once they're made if they work, then they weren't viewed as a crisis. If they don't work, it's viewed as you didn't make the right decision, a little bit like how we hesitated so long dealing with Bosnia and with Kosovo, and as a consequence 200,000 people lost their lives that maybe didn't have to lose lives. It's how we made a mistake in Iraq. We made a mistake in Somalia. So there's gonna be some tough decisions." Did McCain's ad distort Biden's point? It omitted Biden's implication that Obama is up to whatever challenges he'll face. But by raising the interventions in Bosnia, Iraq and Somalia – decisions by Republican and Democratic presidents that Biden framed as flawed – he also left room for the possibility that Obama will make mistakes in grappling with international challenges. So the McCain campaign omitted crucial context, but didn't exactly turn Biden's meaning on its head either. Now let's look more closely at Obama's response ad. "An economic meltdown, two wars," it says. "And John McCain's playing with audio tapes, selectively editing Joe Biden's words." So far, that's more or less accurate, as we've seen. It goes on to say: "The next president will be tested. But here's what Biden actually said about Barack Obama: 'They're gonna find out this guy's got steel in his spine.'" Well yes, Biden did say that. But not at the appearance the McCain campaign highlighted in its ad. The "steel in his spine clip," a phrase Biden has used frequently, came from an appearance a day earlier at a fundraiser in San Francisco . So the Obama campaign took Biden's words out of context even as they accused the McCain campaign of that very sin. But was that a distortion? Not really. It was more of a misdemeanor. At the Seattle fundraiser Biden did indeed praise Obama emphatically, just perhaps not as concisely as he had in San Francisco. (We should note that several news organizations erroneously reported that Biden made the "steel in his spine" comment at the Seattle fundraiser, so the Obama campaign's mistake may have been inadvertant.) Did the McCain campaign "selectively edit" Biden? Yes, but editing generally is selective, and this editing didn't really distort Biden's meaning. Did Biden actually say Obama had steel in his spine? Yes, but a day earlier than he made the comments the McCain ad highlighted, not immediately afterward as the Obama ad claimed. The Obama ad suggests there was some outrageous lapse here, but we don't see it. We find the Obama ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-28T00:00:00	2008-10-27	['Joe_Biden', 'Barack_Obama', 'John_McCain']

pomt-03709	The immigration proposal from the Gang of Eight "is not amnesty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/17/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-immigration-bill-not-amnesty/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took on a public relations role ahead of the release of a bill to overhaul immigration. Rubio appeared on seven Sunday talk shows -- a new record, by most accounts -- to promote the legislation and make a pre-emptive strike against conservative resistance. A possible flash point of that resistance: the notion that the bill would provide amnesty for the millions of immigrants living in the United States illegally. "This is not amnesty," Rubio said on Fox News Sunday on April 14, 2013. "Amnesty is the forgiveness of something. Amnesty is anything that says do it illegally, it will be cheaper and easier." We wondered if that’s true. Does the bill give amnesty or not? What’s in the bill Eight senators -- four Republicans, four Democrats -- unveiled the legislation April 17. It addresses lots of issues, including work visas and family reunification. But for this story we’re focused on illegal immigration. A detailed summary of the bill describes some of the hurdles that people here illegally would have to clear before becoming eligible to apply for permanent residency or eventually, citizenship. The bill would allow people to seek "Registered Provisional Immigrant Status," by demonstrating residence in the United States prior to Dec. 31, 2011, having no felony convictions and not more than two misdemeanors and paying a $500 penalty plus back taxes. Another $500 would be required after six years. After 10 years under Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, a person could pay $1,000 and seek a green card using a new merit-based system. People brought here illegally as minors, known as "Dreamers," and workers in an agricultural program would get green cards in five years, versus the 10 for everyone else who qualifies. New security measures would have to be under way before unauthorized immigrants could begin that process, however. The bill calls for $4.5 billion for a strategy that includes new surveillance equipment, fencing along the Mexican border and more customs agents. Employers would be required to check the legal status of employees through an electronic system known as E-Verify. What’s amnesty? One legal dictionary defines amnesty as "a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance." In modern American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program, both then and now. And its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is partly why "amnesty" is such a poisonous word today. For a comparison, consider this: the 1986 law granted legal status to any immigrant who had been in the country continuously since 1982, who paid a $185 fine and back taxes and who demonstrated "good moral character." After 18 months, if they learned to speak English, they could become eligible for a green card. So the new bill includes a criminal background check which the 1986 law did not, and it increases the time (to 10 years) and financial requirements (to $2,000) before immigrants could obtain a green card. Arguments pro and con We reached out to immigration experts on all sides for their take on Rubio’s statement. Frank Sharry, director of the pro-citizenship group America’s Voice, said he agrees with Rubio that the bill does not offer amnesty. "If you look at what the consequences are -- first of all you have to come forward and register, submit to a background check. You have to pay fines," he said. "To me it’s kind of like people who are caught for speeding. If you get caught for speeding in many states, they say ‘okay, you have to pay a fine, take a class, lose your license for a while and you’ll be reinstated.’ No one calls that an amnesty." Alex Nowrasteh, with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. "This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions," he said. "If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card." But Steven Camarota with Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration, argued that in practice most amnesties -- such as tax or parking ticket amnesties -- involve both a waiver and a penalty. Tax amnesties, for example, often allow delinquent taxpayers to pay back a defined amount, which may include reduced interest or penalties. So they may end up paying less than they would have under prosecution, but not nothing. In this case, Camarota said, "Is the normal rule of law being suspended? The penalty for being in the U.S. illegally normally says you have to go back to your home country. This says you don’t." "I don’t think the fact that it is an amnesty -- which I think it clearly is -- makes it a bad policy," he said. "They’re just not calling it an amnesty because politically that makes it tougher." Our ruling Rubio argues that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. He’s right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandates fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it’s tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offers a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. We rate Rubio’s statement Half True.

Perhaps that’s part of what Wisconsinite Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff for President Donald Trump, was alluding to during a July 9, 2017, interview on "Fox News Sunday." Attempting to downplay Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Priebus said such interloping has been done for years by other countries, as well. Trump has said, Priebus told host Chris Wallace, that Russia "probably meddled in the election, they did meddle in the election." Priebus continued: "The one thing that he also says -- which drives the media crazy, but it’s an absolute fact -- is that others have as well, and that's true. China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years." The White House didn’t reply to our emails seeking information to back Priebus’ statement. But experts told us that, aside from the Chung affair, there is no evidence that China -- and certainly not North Korea -- have meddled in American elections. And what U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did is far different from the Chung matter. Russia’s meddling Here is how the agencies began their key findings on Russian meddling in a January 2017 report: Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations. We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments. As has been widely reported, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors gained access to several states’ electoral agencies. Experts believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media and get picked up by English-language conspiratorial websites. Most recently, in July 2017, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian agent who had promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and that the president's son knew the allegedly incriminating information was being peddled by the highest levels of the Russian government in order to support the Trump campaign. China and North Korea The dozen experts we contacted said they were aware of no evidence to back Priebus’ claim, or were aware only of the Chung matter. In the Chung case, money was inappropriately or illegally given to a candidate’s campaign account. Priebus’ claim suggests a much broader and government-orchestrated foreign effort, on par with the Russian one. "It’s possible there is some classified intelligence report on China and North Korea and U.S. elections, but I have never heard this claim before, nor seen any evidence," said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Yoshiko Herrera, who is the former director of the school’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia. "Also, I think for both China and North Korea, they see little difference between U.S. presidential candidates, but rather think of American politicians in general as opposed to China’s or North Korea’s interests, so I don’t know what the motivation for meddling in elections would be." Indeed, Priebus’ claim struck some experts as bizarre. "I have never heard this charge before," said political science professor Robert Ross, an associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. Experts on North Korea were more blunt. "This notion that North Korea meddles in American elections is completely baseless," said Mitchell Lerner, director of the Institute for Korean Studies at Ohio State University. "It’s sort of a stunning assertion," said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. "I just don’t know where it’s coming from. There certainly is no evidence for it." Our rating Speaking to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Priebus said: "It's an absolute fact" that China and North Korea "have consistently over many, many years" meddled in U.S. elections. During President Bill Clinton’s 1996 reelection campaign, money from Chinese citizens, including the head of China’s military agency, was illegally funneled to the reelection effort. But there is no evidence that either China or North Korea -- consistently and over many years -- meddled in U.S. elections. And certainly nothing on the scale of the Russian efforts in the 2016 presidential race, which reached to the highest levels of the Russian government. We rate Priebus’ statement False.

pomt-03455	The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation is a "proven job creator."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/19/john-nygren/rep-john-nygren-says-wisconsin-economic-developmen/	Nearly two years after its creation, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. -- the quasi-private jobs agency created by Gov. Scott Walker -- has been criticized by Democrats for management turnover, failure to follow up on past due loans and other problems. Those complaints got new life in early May when the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau issued a bruising auditabout WEDC’s effectiveness. The audit criticized the agency for poor record keeping, sloppy internal practices, and giving awards to ineligible businesses and projects. It also said there was no way to measure the agency’s effectiveness in spurring job creation, in part because WEDC failed to follow basic standards in state law regarding the clear and proper use of taxpayer money. WEDC was created in 2011 as the successor of the state’s Commerce Department with the idea that a private agency would be more effective at encouraging business growth than a state agency. The audit painted a far different picture. As lawmakers and Walker debated how to improve WEDC, support came May 8, 2013, from state Rep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), co-chairman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee. He argued the agency needed more time to prove itself and said there should be no cuts to the WEDC budget because the agency was a "proven job creator." That caught our attention because it seemed to contradict the statements in the very audit that Nygren was responding to. When we asked Nygren for evidence to back up his claim, aide Jennifer Malcore said his statement was from "a local perspective." "He has talked with businesses in his district that have taken advantage of WEDC services and have increased their employees," Malcore said. That’s a narrow answer, and we’ll return to it below. But Nygren’s statement addressed the overall performance of the new agency. And that’s where we start to find trouble. About that audit For starters, even the auditors could not evaluate the effectiveness of WEDC’s job creation, noting this in their report: "The report WEDC submitted in November 2012 did not contain all required information, contained some inaccurate information, and did not clearly present information about the number of jobs created and retained as a result of its programs. For these reasons, and in the absence of verified performance information, we did not assess the effectiveness of WEDC’s economic development programs." Likewise, WEDC did not cite a number for total jobs created in its 2012 annual report. Rather, the report said that in fiscal year 2012 -- which ended June 30, and covered the agency’s first year in operation -- WEDC provided 287 "awards" worth $500 million to state companies. The incentives included tax credits, bonding and grants and loans "to companies that have or will go on to start, expand or relocate their operations in Wisconsin." The report added: "A total of 23,759 jobs in Wisconsin are anticipated to be impacted directly by investments made by WEDC in FY12." That means that the agency expects that number of people that will be hired in the future by companies that received assistance. Nygren’s statement did not involve a claim of a specific number of jobs, or compare the performance of WEDC to the old Commerce Department. So it turns largely on how successful WEDC’s performance has been in specific instances. Since it is a new agency, it’s understandable that many of its efforts have not yet led to hiring, or will lead to jobs in the future. WEDC spokesman Thomas Thieding said: "We don’t create the jobs. We help the job creators." Yet the audit pointed out that WEDC needs to do a better job of following up with companies to see how many jobs were created. "Local perspective." For the "local perspective" Nygren’s aide cited, his office directed us to seven companies. We spoke to executives from several firms, large and small. All said that financial and other assistance from WEDC was an important factor behind their decision to add workers. Here’s a synopsis: Precision Iceblast Corp. moved in early 2012 from Michigan to a building in the Peshtigo industrial park. The company deploys crews that use machines fueled by dry ice to do paint removal and other tasks, mostly in power plants and factories. Precision received $400,000 in tax credits and, in return, promised to create 64 jobs, under a contract with WEDC. In general the credits range from $3,000 to $7,000 per job, depending on the level of pay. Companies can also get credits based on a percentage of a capital investment they make. "If a company doesn't create the jobs they simply don't get the tax credits., Thieding said. "The only way tax credits are approved is if a company meets the terms of a contract." WEDC helped Precision find a suitable facility, and gave advice about expanding internationally, said Paul Lemery, vice president. "They did a lot of the grunt work for us," he said. Employment grew from 55 to about 70 now, and is on track to meet the employment goal within three years, Lemery said. "If it wasn’t for them, we would have just built in Michigan." Marinette-based Vargo Tool and Die Inc. added a new facility and seven jobs in 2012 in Peshtigo after WEDC helped, said company owner Doug Vargo. Through WEDC, Vargo received $58,000 in tax credits and promised to create 12 jobs under an agreement signed in April 2013. The company also received assistance from the city of Pesthigo in the form of a tax district. The new building has a boring mill and a large crane that allows the company to bid on additional work, Vargo said, adding that he believes employment could grow to 12 at that facility within five years. "All together, we got $700,000 from the state and Peshtigo," Vargo said. "It turned out to be a really good deal for us." Marinette Marine, one of the state’s largest employers, received $28 million in tax credits through WEDC and promised to create 1,000 jobs under an agreement signed in August 2011. WEDC "played an integral role" in Marinette’s ability to land a major federal contract as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin Corp. to build littoral combat ships for the U.S. Navy, said Scott Wellens, Marinette Marine director of quality and facilities. He added the agency has been a "strong partner in the creation of jobs" at Marinette. The shipyard has built and delivered two of the ships and Lockheed has a contract to build a total of 10 of the ships in Marinette. WEDC’s assistance helped Marinette to be competitive in bidding for the work, Wellens said. It also helped the company establish a maritime center for excellence, which helps Marinette work with suppliers to become more efficient and competitive, he said. Marinette has added about 1,000 jobs in the past three years and has total employment of 1,750 today, Wellens said. State efforts to help the company began in the spring of 2010, under then Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle -- before Walker was elected and a year before WEDC was created. The state offered Marinette $50 million in incentives, with the promise that the company create 1,000 jobs. That was revised to $28 million under Walker "with the opportunity to expand another $10 million for another large project subject to new employee numbers," said Thieding. Our rating Nygren defended the new Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. after an audit criticized the agency’s record keeping and performance. The agency, Nygren said, was "a proven jobs creator." The Legislative Audit Bureau and the agency’s annual report say that because the agency was so poorly run it’s impossible to determine how many jobs WEDC helped create. WEDC projectsthat the agency helped create 23,759 jobs. But that’s a prediction. Nygren directed us to northeastern Wisconsin employers who received help from the agency. Of the three companies we contacted, they reported adding a total of 1,022 jobs of a promised a total of 1,076 in exchange for $28.46 million in tax credits. And WEDC doesn’t deserve sole credit for the largest employer, Marinette Marine, which added more than 1,000 jobs. The state began efforts to help Marinette well before the agency was established. So Nygren’s statement is true on the local level, but it’s impossible to measure in the broad sense. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00773	"The founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/apr/10/rand-paul/liberty-themed-speech-rand-paul-attributed-nh-mott/	U.S. Sen. Rand Paul invoked New Hampshire's state motto while speaking to its residents this week, seizing a chance to emphasize the idea that his libertarian-leaning ideals align with Granite State history. "When the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die, they didn't leave a lot of wiggle room," he said to a crowd in Milford's town hall in his first New Hampshire appearance since announcing his run for president. "New Hampshire founders didn’t seek out the mushy middle. They admonished you to live free." The Kentucky Republican didn't just use the phrase. He attempted to explain where it came from. And it looks like he got a little mixed up along the way. We reached out to Paul’s New Hampshire advisors, but didn’t hear back. New Hampshire was one of the original 13 states and ratified the U.S. Constitution on June 21, 1788. Before that it was formed as a royal province in 1677, and John Cutt was its first president. The words "Live Free or Die," as cited by New Hampshire law, were written by General John Stark on July 31, 1809 – long after New Hampshire became a state. A legendary military man, Stark offered the phrase as a toast. Because of his failing health, he declined an invitation to head up a reunion of the 1777 Battle of Bennington in Vermont, but left the group with those famous words. A similar invitation was extended again the following year, saying, "The toast, sir, which you sent us in 1809 will continue to vibrate with unceasing pleasure in our ears, 'Live Free or Die; Death Is Not the Worst of Evils.' " It must still have been vibrating in 1945, when the motto was formally adopted by the state Legislature. Who "the founders of New Hampshire" are depends on your definition, but Stark isn't typically considered among them. They could be the group that turned a community of towns into a "royal province" in 1679 – 49 years before Stark was born. They could also be the Congress of New Hampshire, which created in 1776 an independent constitution. Or they could be the people that ratified the U.S. Constitutiona few years later. But none of those groups included Stark. Nevertheless, a strong liberty-oriented sentiment existed in the state long before Stark, and even before it was called New Hampshire. Among the earliest explorers of New Hampshire was Captain John Smith of England, who upon seeing the land is quoted as saying, "Here should be no landlords to rack us with high rents, or extorted fines to consume us. Here every man may be a master of his own labor and land in a short time." And in 1775, less than a year before New Hampshirites drew up their own constitution, Patrick Henry uttered famous words, "Give me liberty or give me death," that people outside of New Hampshire often confuse with the state motto. Henry delivered those remarks during a speech in Virginia during the American Revolution. It’s fair to assume liberty, and independence from the the royal rule of England, was on the minds of New Hampshire’s founders at the time it became a state, but not specifically Stark’s words. New Hampshire’s motto is often invoked by politicians, like it was last month by Sen. Ted Cruz and in February by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, as the Associated Press reported. And Paul isn't the first one to get the facts about Stark wrong. In 2011, Vice President Joe Biden referred to Stark as a former New Hampshire governor. That same year, Perry referred to him as "John Spark," Holly Ramer of The Association Press reported. Our ruling Rand Paul said "the founders of New Hampshire came up with the motto Live Free or Die." New Hampshire’s motto is attributed to General John Stark, who was instrumental in defending it and the other colonies. But he wasn’t a founder of the state, and the motto wasn’t adopted until well after his death. As one of the original 13 states to ratify the U.S. constitution, it’s not a stretch to think New Hampshire’s founders were focused on liberty, but not specifically the words of Stark. We rate the claim False.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-04-10T18:17:33	2015-04-08	['Live_Free_or_Die']
pomt-00476	Says Richard Cordray "secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/14/republican-governors-association/ohio-tv-ad-republican-group-misleads-attack-richar/	A Republican group says that when Richard Cordray worked for the federal government, he collected Americans’ financial data in secret and then the data was hacked. "Cordray was supposed to protect Americans from financial crime," says a TV ad by the Republican Governors Association in Ohio. "Instead, Cordray secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times. Your data compromised." The ad makes it sound like Cordray collected information on his own initiative, but it’s actually referring to Cordray’s role in the federal government as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama over the objections of Republicans. It’s misleading to state that Cordray collected data in secret because the law allowed data collection. It’s also misleading to suggest that there was a hack, which implies an outsider broke into the data. However, there was a security breach. We’ll explain the full context. Cordray left his job at the consumer bureau in 2017, and Mick Mulvaney, a critic of the bureau, took over. Cordray is now running for Ohio governor against Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. Did the bureau 'secretly' collect data? The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act created the bureau and gave it authority to gather and compile information from a variety of sources, such as consumer complaints, voluntary surveys, surveys and interviews with consumers and financial service providers, and reviews of available databases. The law also contained privacy provisions. We found examples dating back to 2010 of supporters and opponents commenting on the data collection. In an article in Bank Technology News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., praised the idea of essential "real-time data collection" so that the bureau could be an "effective cop." An editorial in the Orange County Register quoted an expert who raised concerns about the bureau’s plans to collect data on consumers transactions. A federal Government Accountability Report in 2014 discussed in detail how the bureau collected data from financial institutions and financial aggregators. Jeff Sovern, who teaches consumer protection law at St. John’s University, said it would be hard to collect information about the functioning of consumer financial markets without seeing information about credit cards and mortgages. "The bureau was established in part to keep the mortgage lending that led to the Great Recession from happening again, after all," he said. The ad contained no citations for its point, although association spokesman Jon Thompson sent us news articles pertaining to both. Thompson pointed to Cordray’s testimony Jan. 28, 2014, before a House committee. U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., asked Cordray: "Would you object to getting permission from consumers, those people who you work for, before you collect and monitor their information?" Cordray said if the bureau had to get individuals’ permission before it sought aggregate data about the credit card market, that "would have the purpose of completely making it impossible for the agency to have any kind of data to know what's going on in these markets." Todd J. Zywicki, a George Mason University law professor and critic of the bureau under Cordray, said that most Americans don’t know that their private information is transmitted from banks to the government. "In that sense, ‘secret’ seems like an accurate term to me," he said. (News reports said that the Trump administration considered Zywicki to take over the bureau.) 'Hack' at consumer protection bureau As for the claim that the information was hacked, the RGA pointed to Mulvaney’s response to a question during an April 12, 2018, Senate committee if the data had been hacked. Mulvaney replied: "I want to be careful about what I say and I'll be happy to talk about this more in private, but we have been able to document about 240 lapses in our data security." Mulvaney said an additional 800 lapses were suspected but hadn’t been confirmed. Mulvaney provided similar information in January in a letter to Warren stating that before his tenure there were 233 confirmed breaches of personally identifiable information within the bureau’s consumer response system by the bureau or contractors. To put that number in context, the consumer bureau has handled more than one million complaints. (A spokesman for the bureau provided PolitiFact with the letter sent to Warren but declined to answer questions.) Mulvaney told senators he instituted a data collection freeze and had hired an outside party to test the integrity of the system. On May 31, Mulvaney told his staff in an email that "after an exhaustive review by outside experts, including a comprehensive ‘white-hat hacking’ effort, we can lift that hold. The independent review concluded that ‘externally facing bureau systems appear to be well-secured.’" Zywicki said that the use of the term "hack" in the ad is not correct. "There have been hundreds of compromises of consumer information, but mainly they have been by inadvertently disclosing personally identifiable information by the contractors who collect the information that gets dumped into the consumer complaint database," he said. Our ruling A Republican Governors Association ad said that Richard Cordray "secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times." It’s misleading to state that the data was collected in secret when the law that established that the bureau could collect data to protect consumers. If some consumers didn’t realize the data would be collected, that doesn’t mean it was a secret. The use of the word "hack" is the wrong term -- it implies some nefarious person hacked into the data, and that’s not the case. There were breaches of personal information by the bureau or contractors. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14315	"The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long….the book of Revelation is (also) 10,000 words long."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/30/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-isnt-exaggerating-extreme-length-missouris/	At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, former Speaker of the Missouri House Catherine Hanaway managed to work barbers and the Bible into the same sentence. "The barber regulation here in Missouri is 10,000 words long. … The book of Revelation is 10,000 words long. Surely we can tell a barber how many combs to have in fewer words than it takes to describe Armageddon." What struck us about Hanaway’s claim — other than the relative importance of a barber’s toolkit and Judgment Day — was the sheer volume of regulations. Are there really 10,000 words regulating the people who cut our hair? Barbers are governed by the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners, a division of the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration. So, just how long are these regulations? Well, Hanaway could’ve picked something much longer than Revelation. We copied the full statutes and regulations governing barbers and cosmetologists into GoogleDocs and the word count was nearly 60,000. Even after removing the chapters that only apply to cosmetologists, the total is about 40,000. When we ran Revelation through the word count, we came up with about 12,000. When we dove into all 60,000 words, we found that most of the regulations have to do with licensing and training requirements. In order to work as a barber in Missouri, you have to attend a barber school and earn a license. And in order to teach students to be barbers, schools have to meet certain standards. The rules also cover sanitation codes and apprenticeships. Splitting hairs Hanaway said we shouldn’t need so many words to tell a barber how many combs to have. But that’s not exactly what the regulations are for. There is no statute requiring the guy cutting your hair at Supercuts to have at least five combs. There is one rule that calls for a specific number of combs, but it applies exclusively to barber schools. Schools are required to provide their students with training kits that contain, among other things, at least four combs. A little off the top So why would Hanaway bring up an obscure barber school statute at the gubernatorial debate? It’s not the first time she's mentioned it. In 2015, Hanaway met with Phelps County Republicans and brought up the same 10,000-word figure. Her campaign website even pledges to "Start cutting away at overly long, overly burdensome regulations like the more than 10,000 words regulating our state’s barbers." We reached out to Hanaway’s campaign about why she chose to highlight barbers and heard back from Will Scharf, policy director of Hanaway for Governor. Scharf called barbers an "instructive example" of over-regulation and part of a larger plan from Hanaway to "institute a moratorium on all new non-emergency regulations" if elected. Hanaway isn’t alone in her goal of trimming barber regulations, either. In 2013, a bill that would have made earning a license optional for service providers such as barbers and cosmetologists earned support from several Republicans, but ultimately the bill failed to pass. Scharf told us that Hanaway’s views are separate from that legislation. However, if such a bill were to pass, attending a barber school would be optional and the number of combs in a toolkit made moot. Our ruling Hanaway said there are 10,000 words of regulations for barbers in Missouri, the same number that are in the book of Revelation. The Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners Statutes and Regulations isn’t just as long as the book of Revelation — it’s much longer. The numbers more than make her point.

She has proposed cutting $88 million from the state’s $2.7-billion Medicaid spending in the next fiscal year and has created a task force to "reinvent" the program. During the March 13, 2015 taping of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, Raimondo argued that the costs of the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor are extraordinarily high in the state. "You have to remember," she said, "Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average. So we have to do a better job. It's just not sustainable." She made a similar statement on Rhode Island Public Radio. Paying, on average, 60 percent more for anything seems pretty scandalous. We decided to see if the typical cost of a Rhode Island Medicaid recipient was really that much higher than average, and whether per-patient costs were actually lower in 48 other states. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation is a reliable source of data on health issues. We got a state-by-state tally of total state and federal Medicaid spending for the 2013 fiscal year and divided it by the number of people in each state on Medicaid in December 2013 in hopes of getting a rough estimate. By that back-of-the-envelope method, Rhode Island ranked fifth, not second, with all the New England states except New Hampshire in the top 10. The cost was 39 percent above the national average. But that's using 12 months of expenses and one-month enrollment totals. Laura Snyder, a senior policy analyst with Kaiser, said that's an apples-to-oranges mix. When we asked Raimondo's office for the source of her numbers, her spokeswoman cited Kaiser as well, specifically a page that directly ranks Medicaid spending per enrollee by state, although it doesn't list actual total spending or enrollment. And it's from the 2011 fiscal year. Nonetheless, on that list, Rhode Island, at $9,247 per enrollee, does indeed rank second. Only Alaska, at $9,474, spent more. In addition, per enrollee spending in Rhode Island was 60 percent higher than the $5,790 U.S. average. So, by that ranking, Raimondo is correct on both counts. We asked why newer numbers aren't available. Snyder said annual enrollment statistics by state are slow to come out from the federal government, so the 2011 data are the most recent available. Because we wondered if state rankings fluctuate significantly from year to year -- and might be significantly different in 2012, 2013 and 2014 -- we asked Kaiser to see its rankings from some previous years. They gave us data going back to 2000. It turns out that our standing has bounced around a bit, but not a lot. For example, Rhode Island ranked fifth in 2010 and 2009, but ranked first in 2007. Our ruling Raimondo said, "Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average." But in making her statement on one of the central elements in her proposed budget, Raimondo didn’t note that the numbers were from the 2011 year. Granted, those are the most recent statistics available, according to Kaiser. But a lot can happen in four years. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-12625	A study of where teachers apply to work found that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/31/tony-evers/state-school-superintendent-misses-claim-5-percent/	At a campaign stop in northern Wisconsin, State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers addressed a hot topic: the declining supply of new teachers. The trend "concerns me from the Northwoods point of view," Evers said, according to a WXPR public radio story that aired March 13, 2017. He added that a University of Wisconsin-Madison study had found that among teachers looking for work, "less than 5% wanted to work in rural Wisconsin." That’s bleak news for rural school districts -- if true. Is it? Behind the number The Evers campaign told us the statistic came from research conducted by Peter Goff, a UW-Madison professor who is leading a team studying teacher supply and demand in Wisconsin. Goff shared with us a draft version of the study, which is expected to be published soon by the Wisconsin Center for Education Research, headquartered on the campus. Evers and other DPI officials were briefed on a preliminary, 2016 version of the findings. The study by Goff and UW-Madison education graduation student Ellie M. Bruecker analyzed 194,495 applications for teaching vacancies in public school districts between January and October of 2014. The data came from a job-application website, the Wisconsin Education Career Access Network, and included those newly entering the profession as well as existing teachers. Evers comment that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin" doesn’t square with the study’s findings. Here are some key findings from the study: -- 54 percent of prospective teachers did not apply for any vacancies in a rural school. -- 40 percent applied to multiple types of districts, including rural ones. -- Less than 5 percent applied only to rural vacancies. That last conclusion reflects the claim made by Evers. But if that fact is what he was thinking of, his claim didn’t accurately reflect the report. Less than 5 percent of applicants applied exclusively to rural districts, but a total of 45 percent showed interest in rural vacancies. Goff said there is clearly an aversion to rural districts for many applicants. Another piece of evidence for that: The average applicant submits only 15 percent of their applications to rural vacancies. But, "applicant pools in rural districts don’t look any different than applicant pools in urban areas or towns," Goff told us. They have the same number of applicants, on average, with similar levels of experience, certification, advanced degrees and competitiveness of undergraduate institution. Our rating Evers claimed a study of where teachers apply to work found that "less than 5 percent wanted to work in rural Wisconsin." The study found that schools in cities, suburbs or towns all draw more interest than rural districts, but Evers badly overstated the case. We rate his claim False. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2017-03-31T10:57:02	2017-03-10	['Wisconsin']
pomt-13785	"Our economy is not growing."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/rick-scott/florida-gov-rick-scott-wrongly-says-economy-not-gr/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott likes to be known as the "jobs governor" in Florida. Opening the third night of the Republican National Convention, Scott said the United States is struggling on the economic front, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump knows how to make it strong again. "Let me tell you why this is the time for Donald to be president," Scott said. "A lot of politicians like to give speeches where they say ‘We are at a crossroads.’ That’s not really where we are today. Today America is in a terrible world, record-high debt. Our economy is not growing. Our jobs are going overseas. We’ve allowed our military to decay and we project weakness on the international stage." Trump made a similar statement about the economy at a Miami debate in March. Trump said, "GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters," which rated False. Our fact-check will focus on Scott’s statement that the economy is "not growing." We emailed Scott’s political consultant Wednesday night and did not get a reply by deadline. Economic growth A key way to measure economic growth is the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the sum total of a country’s economic activity. The Bureau of Economic Analysis within the U.S. Department of Commerce posts quarterly and annual GDP data for the United States. According to the data, GDP has grown every year since 2010, between 1.5 and 2.5 percent a year. The last time GDP was negative was in 2009 -- negative 2.8 percent -- amid the recession. So for the past few years, the economy has been growing — maybe just not by as much as Scott would like. To be fair, Scott isn’t alone in wishing growth were higher. As we have previously reported, there’s a common belief among economists that the United States is unlikely to see the rapid growth it experienced during the first few decades after World War II, when the country had fewer international competitors. Former 2016 Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced skepticism when he laid out a goal for 4 percent growth. Quite a few Republican presidents have served during times of slow growth as well. According to a July 2014 paper by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, GDP growth hovered around 2 percent during the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower; the combined second term of President Richard Nixon and the tenure of his successor President Gerald Ford; and the single term of President George H.W. Bush. And the growth rate for the second term of President George W. Bush was well below 1 percent. We interviewed three experts on the economy who disputed Scott’s claim. In addition to the growing GDP, they mentioned other positive economic signs, such as growing private sector jobs and the decline of the unemployment rate since the end of the recession. "Certainly the recovery since 2009 has not been as swift as would be ideal, but ‘not growing’ does not seem adequately supported to me," said University of California Davis history professor Eric Rauchway. The American economy has been growing since the recovery started in June 2009, said Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard University professor of capital formation and growth who served as a Council of Economic Advisers member in the Bill Clinton administration. "Growth in GDP since then, while not as strong as we would like, has been steady," Frankel said. "And it has been clearly greater than growth in Europe or Japan." Our ruling Scott said, "Our economy is not growing." The GDP has grown between 1.5 and 2.5 percent each year since 2010. That’s perhaps not the level of growth Scott wants, but it’s misleading to say that the economy isn’t growing.

pomt-14671	Hostages were released as soon as Ronald Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was "no longer under the command of someone weak."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/marco-rubio/rubio-wrongly-credits-reagan-1981-release-hostages/	As news of Iran’s release of American prisoners spread, Republicans were quick to deny President Barack Obama much credit for the deal. Presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the United States should not have made any concessions to Iran. Part of the deal included Obama granting clemency to seven Iranians charged in U.S. courts with violating economic sanctions against Iran. "Our enemies now know that if you can capture an American, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it," Rubio said on Meet the Press on Jan. 17, 2016. Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: "So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?" Rubio replied: "When I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama, and it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from Iran." We flagged Rubio’s comment as a misleading framing of history. Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it. Instead, the Iranians had tired of holding the hostages, and that the administration of Jimmy Carter did the legwork to get the hostages released. We asked the Rubio campaign for response but did not hear back. The hostage crisis of 1979 It’s a GOP talking point we’ve debunked before. In 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said, "I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength ... There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in." We rated his claim Pants on Fire. In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy and held 52 American hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of Carter’s handling of the crisis. But negotiations for the hostages’ release started well before Election Day. In September 1980, the Iranians contacted the Carter administration with a proposal, according to Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and the author of October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. The agreement that led to the release involved $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. Sick told us that the Iranians feared having to start negotiations over with a new administration and believed that they had extracted most of the benefits from holding the hostages. Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, according to a contemporary report in the New York Times. "The hostages, whose 14 months of captivity had been a central focus of the presidential contest last year, took off from Tehran in two Boeing 727 airplanes at 12:25 p.m., Eastern standard time, the very moment that Mr. Reagan was concluding his solemn Inaugural Address at the United States Capitol," its report says. Reagan announced the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with congressional leaders in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return. Despite the showy announcement, scholars of the period say that Reagan did not play any significant role in freeing the hostages. "Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats," said David Farber, author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. No Reagan administration officials participated in the negotiations, Farber said, and the Iranians waited to officially release the Americans as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. "They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages," Farber said. Dave Houghton, a political scientist and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis, told PolitiFact that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and that it was possible that the Iranians "didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail." "I don't think they were scared into the release," Houghton said. "In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq." Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release. "It is clear that Sen. Marco Rubio is falling back on an exaggerated urban legend that the only way to deal with Iran is through implied threats of military retaliation, as President Reagan supposedly did," he said. "Actually, successful U.S. diplomacy then and now played the most significant role." Our ruling Rubio said that Iranian hostages were released in 1981 as Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was "no longer under the command of someone weak." In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us. The Carter administration negotiated the deal months before Reagan’s inauguration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team. Rubio’s claim is an imaginative re-reading of history.

pomt-01121	Says Jeb Bush "not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/05/democratic-national-committee/jeb-bush-opposes-gay-marriage-and-gays-adopting-dn/	When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a bid to run for president, the Democrats let loose their opposition research. The Democratic National Committee released talking points it wanted Democrats to use against Bush; Politico published a leaked copy on Dec. 19. Bush then posted the talking points on his own Facebook page, denouncing the attacks as "silly" and "misleading." The DNC attacked Bush’s statements and positions on a long list of topics, saying that another Bush presidency would mean policies "that wreck the economy, that give massive breaks to the wealthy and corporations, and that are out of step with American people including women, LGBT Americans, Latinos and people of color. The reality is that Jeb Bush is no different than almost all Republicans on issue after issue." Among the talking points was this one: "Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children." The timing of that particular attack caught our eye, because in recent months plaintiffs have filed lawsuits to overturn Florida’s gay marriage ban, which voters approved in 2008. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle ruled in August that the ban is unconstitutional, but he stayed his order to allow for appeals. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests to extend the stay, Hinkle told county clerks they will be violating the U.S. Constitution if they don’t issue same sex marriage licenses on Jan. 6. A Miami-Dade judge allowed gay marriages to proceed in that county Jan. 5. Here, we’ll look at whether the DNC was accurate in saying that Bush opposes same-sex marriage and believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children. Same-sex marriage While in office from 1999 to 2007, Bush consistently opposed gay marriage, though he was not a leading crusader against it. In 2004, Bush’s brother President George W. Bush proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriages. At the time, Florida law did not allow for same-sex marriage, though there was no specific ban on it in the state Constitution. In 2004, 11 states approved their own gay marriage bans. A spokeswoman for the DNC pointed to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat that stated: "Bush supports his brother, President George W. Bush, in seeking a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman." Over the next few years, religious conservatives in Florida worked to get a question on the ballot banning gay marriage in the state constitution, and they succeeded in 2008. Bush faced questions about it while in office. At times, he showed some support with caveats for a state constitutional ban, but he also often said that he was reluctant to change the Constitution. "If there was a threat that gay marriage would be accepted in our state, then I might be supportive of it," Bush said in November 2004, according to the Orlando Sentinel. "I'm not sure it's necessary to do this in a pre-emptive fashion." It’s worth noting that when Bush was in office, he had plenty of company among both Republicans and Democrats in opposing gay marriage. It wasn’t until May 2012 that President Barack Obama made a Full Flop in favor of gay marriage. And it wasn’t until March 2013 that Hillary Clinton announced she now supported gay marriage. That same month Bill Clinton denounced the Defense of Marriage Act that he had signed in 1996. Gay adoption In 2001, a federal judge upheld Florida’s ban on gay adults adopting. The state argued that married heterosexuals provided a more stable home (even though the state allowed single people to adopt). Bush supported that ruling. As Bush faced re-election in 2002, the ban remained a hot topic as a challenge winded its way through federal appeals court. Bush said he was reluctant to take a stand since the issue was in court. "I think it's an issue that is marginal to the bigger issue, which is, how do we get children in loving homes?" Bush said. Bush’s position on gays adopting came up during an October 2002 debate when he faced re-election against Democratic rival Bill McBride. "If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is a man and a wife. That is the law of this land, it's in the courts, but I also believe that personally," Bush said. A poll done for the Orlando Sentinel during that race showed that a majority of Floridians at the time opposed gays adopting and same-sex marriages. In January 2004, a federal appeals court upheld the ban. "The decision validates Florida's conclusion that it is in the best interest of adopted children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother," Bush said in a news release. In 2010, a state appeals court struck down the ban. Bush’s comments since he left office Bush has made a few statements since he left office defending "traditional marriage" but has said little about gays adopting. In an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose in 2012, he seemed to express some tolerance for gay parents and used softer language to talk about gay couples. "I think traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned and not at the expense of discriminating in other forms of family structure." Bush said. "So I don’t support it, but I would say that wholesome loving family life ought to be kind of the organizing principle in a free society. If we don’t want to have government overwhelm us, then we have to be self-governing. ... And if people love their children with all their heart and soul, and that’s what they do, and that’s how they organized their life, that should be held up as examples for others to follow, because we need it. We desperately need it, and that can take all sorts of forms. It doesn’t have to take the one that I think should be sanctioned under the law." In a statement to reporters at an event at Mississippi College in March 2013, he said the U.S. Supreme Court should not decide the issue: "I am a supporter of traditional marriage. I do think that these decisions should be made at the state level, so I hope the constitutional amendment in California is not overturned." (He made his comments a few months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act and dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage.) Bush told the Miami Herald on Jan. 4 in a brief interview, "It ought to be a local decision. I mean, a state decision. The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it’s been overturned by the courts, I guess." We asked a spokeswoman for Bush about his stance on gay adults adopting and marrying. Initially, we did not get a reply. But soon after we published this report, a spokesperson sent us two comments from Bush. On gay couples adopting: "Previously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision." On same-sex marriage: "We live in a democracy, and regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law. I hope that we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue – including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty." Our ruling The DNC said that "Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children." As Bush continues to explore running for president, he may provide more specific comments about his current views, but for now we are rating the DNC’s statement based on the evidence that was available at the time they made the statement. While in office, Bush repeatedly said that he opposed gay marriage, although he was reluctant at times to amend the state Constitution since it was already banned in state law. He also opposed gay adults adopting children. Since leaving office, Bush said that he supports "traditional marriage," though he has used a softer tone when asked about it, and did so again when we asked about it. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate this statement Mostly True. Update: Several hours after this item was first published, we received a reponse from Bush's staff, and this report has been updated to include his comments. The ruling remains the same.

pomt-04795	The Obama administration "leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/22/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-blames-obama-linking-cia-pakistani-doctor/	Some former special forces soldiers and CIA officers have produced a video that accuses President Barack Obama of trying to score political points by leaking sensitive intelligence information. The 20-minute video from the group Special Operations OPSEC (short for Operations Security) focuses on the administration’s actions surrounding the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The group claims it isn't favoring a candidate, but it's clear Obama is being targeted. The video makes many points, including one about the arrest by Pakistan of a local doctor recruited by the CIA. "With wanton disregard," OPSEC member Jamie Williamson, a retired Special Forces colonel, says in the video, "this administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden." Retired Maj. Gen Paul Valley follows up. "I’m not sure we have anybody in senior leadership today that understands the propriety and how risky it is on leaks," he says. Former CIA officer Fred Rustman delivers the final summation. "What was done was stupid," Rustman says. "But it was more than stupid. It was done with malice aforethought. It was done for a political purpose. And that’s what I find terrible." We are checking several claims from the video. We've previously examined the claim that the Obama administration invited filmmakers to the White House and revealed intelligence sources and methods. We ruled that Mostly False. In this item, we'll check the claim that the Obama administration leaked the doctor's name. We got no reply to several requests to the OPSEC group for facts that support their claim about the Pakistani doctor. From what we can tell, there aren’t any. Raid details emerge In the weeks after the raid, U.S. officials shared many action-packed details of the operation. The public learned about the number and type of helicopters used and the crash landing that endangered the entire mission. The administration released diagrams of the bin Laden compound where gun battles took place and the room where bin Laden was killed. The OPSEC video suggests that the administration went even further, releasing information that led to the identification and imprisonment of the Pakistani doctor. Early on, U.S. officials said that a bin Laden courier led intelligence officials to bin Laden’s house. What the U.S. did with that information was left vague. Citing an unnamed government source, the Boston Globe reported two days after the raid that "They began monitoring the site day and night with pilotless surveillance aircraft and other tools." By June, the public knew the name of the bin Laden courier and that the CIA had set up a safe-house near the bin Laden compound. The details were sketchy but it was clear that the CIA had established an operation in Abbottabad. Pakistan responds and finds a nurse The raid chilled relations with Pakistan, a key U.S. ally, because U.S. officials suspected that some Pakistani officials had been less than forthcoming in helping the U.S. track down bin Laden. Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Service Intelligence, often called the ISI, is the country’s FBI and CIA rolled up in one. The bin Laden raid was something of an embarrassment for the agency and top Pakistani officials. According to Saeed Shah, a reporter for McClatchy and the British newspaper the Guardian in Abbottabad, the ISI moved quickly to track down people who might have helped American intelligence agencies keep an eye on the bin Laden compound. "The ISI arrested anyone associated with the house," Shah told PolitiFact. One person they arrested was a nurse. "She boasted about having been inside the OBL house," Shah said, adding that the boast "made its way through the community and eventually to me." The ISI questioned and released the woman. It turned out she had been working for Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor who was later arrested and jailed. The nurse likely led the ISI to Afridi, but it's also possible they would have been tipped off due the odd nature of a project Afridi was running. To help the CIA, Afridi had set up a fake vaccination program as a ruse to get DNA samples from the bin Laden household. A close match with a son or grandchild of bin Laden would show that family members lived in the house. Bin Laden was known to keep his family with him so if they were there, chances were good that bin Laden was too. Shah reported that Pakistan had connected Afridi with the CIA and had arrested him. Shah said he learned about Afridi from the nurse and residents of Abbotabad who knew about the vaccination program. "There was no U.S. leak on Afridi," Shah told us. To the contrary, he says, "the U.S. administration tried to stop me publishing the story, both the CIA and the State Dept, by approaching my editors at McClatchy," Shah said, "and also by appealing to me directly by telling me that it would put Afridi's life at risk." Although news reports after Shah's initial story cited a U.S. government official for confirmation, the evidence indicates that Shah's reporting came from Pakistani sources and residents. CNN’s national security analyst Peter Bergen reached the same conclusion. "It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the Americans but the Pakistanis who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid," Bergen wrote in a CNN opinion piece. According to Pakistan’s report on Afridi, right after the raid, his CIA handler advised him and gave him the means to leave the country. Afridi thought he didn’t need to. He is now serving a 33-year sentence -- not for helping the CIA, but for shady dealings with some local tribesmen. Our ruling The Special Operations - OPSEC Education Fund said, "This administration leaked information, deliberately or otherwise, that led to the identification of the Pakistani doctor that helped us in achieving our goals and killing bin Laden." The OPSEC group provides no evidence to support its claim, and journalists close to the scene in Abbottabad say it was the Pakistanis, not the Americans, who identified the doctor. The bin Laden raid triggered the ISI investigation, not anything said by U.S. officials. In fact, the CIA had urged the doctor to leave the country and when Pakistan provided the name of the doctor, US officials tried to prevent it being published. We see no evidence that it was the Obama administration that leaked the name. We rate it False.

Mark Begich "is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/25/americans-prosperity/conservative-ad-says-begich-supports-carbon-tax/	Conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity is spending $400,000 into a TV ad attacking U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, for his position on a potential carbon tax. "Sen. Begich hasn’t always been straight with us," the narrator claims as footage of him supporting Obamacare flashes across the screen. "And now he’s at it again. Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority." PolitiFact wanted to find out if the ad accurately reflects Begich’s position on the carbon tax. A carbon tax would impose a tax or fee on oil, gas and coal usage. The idea is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Because Congress hasn’t come close to passing such a tax, many of the logistics are still up in the air. How Begich has voted Americans For Prosperity pointed us to a couple of amendments to Senate budget resolutions from 2013 as examples of Begich supporting a carbon tax. Begich voted in favor of an amendment to last year’s budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. That amendment failed, but it would’ve called for revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form. Nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. "I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are," Whitehouse told reporters in September. "So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds." So although Begich’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax, he was allying himself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment that could make such a tax more politically palatable. The other vote Americans For Prosperity cited is from an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., which also failed. This amendment would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Begich voted against this amendment, even as some of his Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against this, he wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Begich’s letter to Reid As for "pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority," Americans For Prosperity pointed to a letter Begich and other Democratic senators wrote to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2010. Generally speaking, the letter calls for reform to U.S. energy policy to encourage clean energy: "While fossil fuels are and will continue to be an important part of our economy, we believe the transition to a clean energy economy -- one that includes an all-of-the-above approach -- is an economic, national security and environmental priority." The term "carbon tax" doesn’t appear in the letter. However, Americans for Prosperity zeroed in on the following line: "We believe the scale of this challenge dictates the need for a comprehensive solution that includes making polluters pay through a price on greenhouse gas emissions." A carbon tax could be one way to levy "a price on greenhouse gas emissions." Another way, though, would be through a cap-and-trade program. Begich’s campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter he signed was meant to further a general conversation about climate change. The Hill reported that Begich has "expressed skepticism" about a carbon tax without expressing either explicit support or opposition. Begich acknowledges climate change in general is real and should be addressed by Congress. We’ve also noted that he sometimes breaks with the White House when it comes to taxes on the oil and gas industry. His campaign office put it this way to PolitiFact: "Begich has not supported a carbon tax in the past." Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said "Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority." Begich voted on an amendment that said if there is a carbon tax, the revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form.The letter to Reid said that energy policy should be aimed at putting some sort of price on greenhouse gas emissions, without specifically saying it should be a carbon tax. Begich’s campaign said he’s never explicitly supported a carbon tax. If you were counting votes in the U.S. Senate for a straightforward carbon tax and looked at Begich's record for how he might vote, you'd likely put Begich in the "maybe" column. Americans for Prosperity exaggerated in saying that Begich is "on record" supporting a carbon tax. So we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-08909	Democratic candidate Jeff Greene "ran for Congress as a California Republican."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/28/kendrick-meek/greene-ran-republican-28-years-ago/	Congressman Kendrick Meek attacked his Democratic opponent Jeff Greene in a new political ad set to a disco beat. The ad, called "He's the Man," is Meek's first TV attack on Greene in their U.S. Senate race. The narration goes like this: "Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffet called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.'" The ad then shows footage of Greene saying, "They'll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it's true, but none of it matters." "Betting on suffering does matter," the narrator responds. We previously fact-checked similar claims from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek's statement that Greene "is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now." We rated that Barely True. We researched Greene's activities thoroughly, and found that Greene did make a lot of money on credit default swaps that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene's role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things to hurt the economy. (Read the full report.) We also fact-checked the claim that Greene moved here only two years ago. We rated that True. Here, we're checking Meek's claim that Greene ran for Congress as a California Republican. The history here dates back to 1982. Greene was 28 years old and living in California. He ran as a Republican for Congress, for a seat representing the Los Angeles area. But he came in second in the primary with 28.2 percent of the vote. The winner was David Armor, who won 43.9 percent. The Miami Herald recently tracked down Armor, who was then a 43-year-old social scientist; now he's a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia. Armor won the primary but lost the general election to then-incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson. Armor's recollection is that Greene put out a flier attacking him as an "aging Berkeley radical," based on Armor's time as a student activist at University of California at Berkeley. "It was a hit piece claiming I was a deceiving the people,'' Armor told the Herald. "Being in my 40s, I think I was more offended at being called 'aging' than a 'radical.' " Greene doesn't dispute that he ran for Congress as a Republican. "For a year of my life I was a Republican, and then I quickly got back to what I really believed in,'' he told the Herald in June. What's not clear is how long Greene stayed a Republican. PolitiFact Florida examined Greene's voting history last month, contacting voting officials around the country. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk told us that Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu with a party affiliation of "Decline to State." If Greene changed his party affiliation shortly after the 1982 run, officials were unable to provide documentation of that. Still, the record on Greene's run for Congress as a Republican is undisputed. It was 1982, which was 28 years ago. We rate Meek's statement True.

pomt-09991	"President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/13/keith-olbermann/olbermann-right-about-base-defense-spending/	In response to Republican complaints that the Obama administration is gutting the military, MSNBC's Keith Olbermann fired back, saying that Obama is actually increasing defense spending. "GOP lawmakers (are) falsely accusing the president of gutting the Pentagon’s budget, when in fact President Obama is actually increasing Bush-era defense spending by $21 billion in the new fiscal year," Olbermann said on his Countdown program on MSNBC. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced April 6, 2009, that he planned an overhaul of military spending, reducing the amount on big-ticket items such as the F-22 fighter plane and shifting more money toward new technology and troops. That led to Republican complaints that Gates was gutting defense, which in turn led to Olbermann's comments. "Representatives in Congress (are) wildly and falsely mischaracterizing that as making cuts to the military's budget," Olbermann said. "A) Afghanistan and Iraq spending, that is all in a separate budget . You could look that up. B) In the final year of the Bush administration, the defense budget was $513 billion. In fiscal year 2010 it will be $534 billion. That would be more. In fact, it's an increase of $21 billion, not a cut. As they say, do the math." Olbermann grabs his figures straight from the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget , which calls for a 4 percent increase in base funding for defense. That would, in fact, increase the base defense budget from the 2009 enacted level of $513.3 billion to $533.7 billion. There are a couple caveats here. Base defense spending does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as Olbermann noted. Spending for the wars comes through supplemental budgets. To calculate the cost of defense including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan requires a little math. During the first half of this fiscal year, President Bush secured $66 billion in supplemental funding for the wars, fully aware that a second supplement would be needed from the new president. Obama has requested an additional $83 billion supplement (although $7 billion of that is for foreign aid). So $142 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009. Together with base defense spending of $513 billion, it comes to total 2009 military spending of $655 billion. Obama's proposed budget calls for $534 billion in base defense spending and estimates a "placeholder" amount of $130 billion to fund the wars overseas. Total estimated military spending for 2010: $664 billion. That's a long way of explaining that if you include the costs of the wars, there's an overall $9 billion increase in defense spending under the Obama budget. There's another caveat, said Todd Harrison, fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Obama's base defense budget appears to include some things that in the past were included in supplemental war funding. For example, Gates said $2 billion in his proposed budget to increase intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support for the war — including 50 Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles — would be permanently funded in the base budget. As well it probably should, Harrison said. But for comparison purposes, it inflates the base military spending next year. Details of the defense budget have not yet been released, Harrison said, but he suspects there may be lots of other spending like that which would skew defense spending comparisons. Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while Obama's defense budget may go up a little, some parts of defense spending will go up while other parts go down. And, he said, Republican opponents may be right that procurement spending will go down even as the net defense budget goes up. "The short answer is that they both may be right," Riedl said. Marc Goldwein, policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added that looking at next year's budget isn't the only test of whether the defense will be "gutted" as some have claimed. Many of the procurement changes proposed by Gates won't be felt for years, he said. "It's hard to cut spending really quickly," Goldwein said. "It would have very little effect in 2010. But it could have an effect going forward." There are lots of ways to calculate how much the nation spends on defense, and some methods can be skewed if you include the cost for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we think Olbermann was on pretty solid footing when he cited the budget numbers for base defense spending. But there's an important caveat because the 2010 cost may include things that weren't part of the 2009 number. We can't know exactly how much of that has happened because the administration has not released a detailed budget yet. So for now, we rule Olbermann's comment Mostly True.

pomt-08106	Says Joe Straus "was co-author of a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/dec/13/donna-garner/conservative-education-activist-donna-garner-says-/	Blasting House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, as a "Republican in name only," the conservative Texas Eagle Forum says "he has much more in common with the Democrats." In a Nov. 9 newsletter, the group urges Texans to tell their state representative to vote for one of the other Republicans running for speaker. Legislators will choose the speaker for 2011-12 after the biennial legislative session convenes in January. In a section challenging Straus' conservative bonafides, the newsletter says he "was co-author of a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education." Really? Some background: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. When we sought backup for the statement, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle forum, noted that the claim originated with Donna Garner of Hewitt, a retired teacher and a conservative education activist. Next, Garner told us via e-mail she was referring to House Bill 1842, a 2007 measure titled the "Prevention First Act," which cleared a committee but died before the full House could take it up. Straus was one of its 14 co-authors. In an e-mail, Garner guided us to a May 2007 analysis of the legislation by the House Research Organization, a nonpartisan arm of the Texas House. According to the analysis, the legislation directed the state to promote family-planning services for low-income women and required school districts that provide sex education — including instruction on contraceptives — to explain the difference in effectiveness between correct and incorrect use of contraceptives. Garner stressed a section in the bill analysis outlining opponents' arguments against the bill. Among them: the proposed changes in how schools teach students about contraceptives would thwart efforts to promote abstinence and require detailed discussions about how to put on a condom. The legislation also described "abstinence-only instruction" to mean instruction that doesn't "include information about preventing pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases," HIV and AIDS through any means other than abstinence. Opponents argued that the definition should reflect the definition that appears in Title V of the Social Security Act. The federal law describes abstinence-only instruction as teaching that abstinence is the expected standard for all school-age children and teaches that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, among other points, according to the bill analysis. Again in an e-mail, Garner told us that "Straus' bill was meant to force teachers to emphasize condom/contraceptive use to students which would have, in turn, de-emphasized Title V guidelines that emphasize abstinence-only sex education.... changes in his bill would have resulted in a shift in the way sex education has been taught under Title V in the public schools in Texas." But we found no language in the act potentially putting Planned Parenthood in charge of sex education in Texas. The legislation did not change current law that requires each school district's board and local advisory council of parents and community representatives to review course materials dealing with sexuality, and to comply with a list of restrictions as to how the courses can be taught, with emphasis on abstinence. Garner told us: "If Straus had been a true conservative, he would not have supported H.B. 1842. His deep roots (and those of his wife) with Planned Parenthood undoubtedly led to his being a co-author of this bill. It is no surprise that Planned Parenthood in its fall 2009 Horizon newsletter publicly highlighted Joe Straus' support of its agenda." Straus' wife was on the board of directors of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas in the early 1990s, according to a January 2009 Austin American-Statesman news article. Finally, we consulted folks across the ideological spectrum about whether the proposed legislation would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public-school sex education. In the "no" camp: Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas told us "the statement is not at all accurate." She did say Planned Parenthood, which has pushed "for broader access to medically-accurate, comprehensive sex education and affordable family planning services," supported the legislation. One of the bill's five authors, Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, told us that Planned Parenthood was supportive of the legislation and was among the groups the authors consulted in drafting it. But he said that the legislation would not have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education. Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, also called Garner's statement "inaccurate," and told us that the bill would have required HHSC to conduct an education outreach campaign to promote the reduction of unintended pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases. Kyleen Wright, president of the pro-life group Texans for Life who was listed as a witness against the bill, told us that "it's obviously a stretch to say it gives Planned Parenthood control of sex education." She said the legislation left the proposed outreach-campaign funding in the hands of the state. "It certainly didn't hand (Planned Parenthood) sex education in the state," she said. We got a different take from Jonathan Saenz, director of legislative affairs at the right-leaning Liberty Institute. He told us he thought Garner's claim was valid. "If Planned Parenthood (working through an elected official) has control and/or influence over changes to our statewide law governing how sex education is taught, changes that result in a version of sex education and related women's services that Planned Parenthood desires, approves of, and lobbies for, then they effectively have control of public sex education," he said in a statement. Our finding: In 2007, Straus co-authored a measure intended to promote family planning and to ensure that school districts that teach sex education spell out the effectiveness of contraceptives when used properly and not. Planned Parenthood supported the proposal and worked on the bill with Strama's office, but even if it had passed, it would not have changed the state-mandated, pro-abstinence focus on sex education in Texas schools. Garner can argue that legislation would have changed the education code to align more with Planned Parenthood's values than her own, but to say that it would have put the organization at the helm of sex education in public schools is an over-the-top claim. We rate her statement as Pants on Fire.	None	Donna Garner	None	None	None	2010-12-13T06:00:00	2010-12-09	['Joe_Straus']
pomt-09685	"The public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/13/diana-degette/degette-claims-public-option-will-be-privately-fun/	Amid debate over a health reform bill, the House adopted new restrictions on funding abortions, and Democratic congresswoman Diana DeGette is not happy about the development. As chairwoman of the Pro-Choice Caucus, DeGette of Colorado is upset that under the bill low-income individuals would not be able to use federal subsidies to buy abortion coverage through a health insurance exchange. Furthermore, a government-run health insurance option would not offer abortion coverage except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered. Here's what she had to say about the issue on the Nov. 9, 2009, episode of the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC. "Nobody in the public option would be able to get an insurance policy that offered abortion coverage," she said. "And we need to remember, the public option is not funded with public money. It's funded with private insurance premiums. So, let's say you have a small business owner who goes in to the public option because they can't get insurance anyplace else, and they want to buy a policy with their own private money, no federal money, that they would be banned from doing that." We've already explored the second part of DeGette's claim, that small businesses and individuals would not be able to buy abortion coverage through the exchange, and found it to be False. In fact, insurers can still offer abortion coverage through the exchange so long as the administrative structure behind it is not supported by federal money, and individuals can buy abortion coverage through the exchange so long as they use their own money. So, for this fact-check, we'll focus on DeGette's other point -- that the public option is funded by private insurance premiums, not public money. The public option has turned out to be the most controversial part of the health care reform. It's a government-run option for people buying insurance on the individual market, not through their employer, and it would be one of many plans offered through a new insurance exchange -- think of it as a one-stop shop for consumers where they can compare costs and benefits between plans. The hope is to increase competition and accountability within the insurance industry. So far, the Senate version of the bill does not include a public option, but Democratic Leader Harry Reid says the bill that comes to the Senate floor will likely include such a plan. The public option has become a flashpoint between Republican opponents of the bill and its Democratic advocates, in part because members of the GOP see it as a government effort to socialize medicine and too expensive. And now that the House has adopted an amendment that officially severed any ties between the public option and abortion coverage, tension between lawmakers on both sides of the abortion debate has only intensified. DeGette's point is that the public plan isn't really public at all because it will be sustained through premiums paid by consumers, so it should not exclude abortion coverage. We looked into exactly how the public option would be funded, and here's what we found: According to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the plan, the public option would be administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, and it would negotiate rates with providers in the public option. To make sure the public plan doesn't have an unfair advantage, the bill requires that the plan be self-sustaining; funding would come from the premiums consumers pay to get coverage. But the feds aren't exactly off the hook. The government will front the operation $2 billion to cover initial administrative costs and claims, though lawmakers expect that sum will be recouped after the program has been in operation for 10 years. So DeGette is right and she's wrong. In the long-term, the public option is meant to be self-sustaining. But first, it will require a big chunk of of public money to get started. We give her a Half True.	None	Diana DeGette	None	None	None	2009-11-13T16:19:57	2009-11-09	['None']

pomt-10263	The U.S. energy policy is to "borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/mark-warner/not-just-china-other-countries-too/	In a keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Mark Warner argued that America is on the wrong track. "When we look around today, we see that for too many Americans that fair shot is becoming more of a long shot," said Warner, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Virginia and the state's former governor. "Two wars, a warming planet, an energy policy that says let's borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us," Warner said. "How many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them?" We don't think Warner meant it literally, as if it were written down somewhere, when he said our policy is to "borrow money from China to buy oil from countries that don't like us." But we do think he meant that's what's happening. We talked to economists about this issue earlier this year when we looked at other claims on the campaign trail; read our story "Mix 'n match creditors with causes." Here's what it comes down to, according to the economists we interviewed: As a country, we spend more than we make, and we don't have much in savings either. So collectively we have been borrowing from foreign countries to pay our bills. One of the important indicators of countries that lend us this money is the list of foreign countries holding U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. government issues Treasury securities to finance its debt. In laymen's terms, these are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment. The No. 1 holder of U.S. Treasury securities among foreign countries isn't China. It's actually Japan. China is No. 2, the United Kingdom is No. 3, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is No. 4. The bonds the government sells are not program-specific, so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government. Warner could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for oil, and that would have been just as true as what he did say. Economists also caution against linking our country's foreign debt to our dependency on foreign-produced oil. "I don't think that there is any link between oil prices causing the low saving of American households or the government's budget deficits. Both preceded the rise in oil prices," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the Brookings Institution whom we interviewed earlier this year. "Some people will prefer a solution that increases energy supply and others will argue that it is time to reduce demand. I don't think the lack of saving will play much of a role." Finally, let's look at the last part of Warner's statement, that we're buying oil "from countries that don't like us." Objectively speaking, we're not sure how they feel about us, but we do know who Americans think are our enemies. A Gallup Poll earlier this year found that Americans believe the following countries are our greatest enemies: Iran - 25 percent; Iraq - 22 percent; China - 14 percent; North Korea/Korea - 9 percent; United States itself - 3 percent; Afghanistan - 3 percent; Pakistan - 2 percent; Russia - 2 percent; Saudi Arabia - 1 percent; Venezuela - 1 percent; Other - 6 percent. The country we buy the most oil from is Canada, according to the Energy Information Administration. No. 2 is Mexico, followed by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Iraq and Russia. So Americans consider only about four of these nine countries their enemies, for what that's worth. Warner is right in some of the larger themes he's expressing. The United States does borrow more than it saves, and we import large quantities of oil to satisfy our energy needs. But the two phenomena aren't causally related. And you could just as easily say that we're borrowing from a number of other countries to pay for oil. For these reasons, we find his statement Half True.

But one well-known figure in Georgia’s legal community says she has avoided taking a stance on the issue for personal and professional reasons. Former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears recently wrote a column in Fulton County’s Daily Report. She praised a group called the Institute for American Values for its recent decision to separate from its past position of opining on same-sex marriage.The mission of the conservative, New York-based organization is to "study and strengthen civil society." Its president, David Blankenhorn, has been a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage, while other board members have been more supportive on the issue. He wrote a book in 2007, "The Future of Marriage," which included his belief that children need a mother and a father. Last year, Blankenhorn described his revised views on same-sex marriage in a New York Times column. Blankenhorn stands by his book, but is now more focused on strengthening the institution of marriage, regardless of the genders involved. "I'm pleased with the direction the Institute is taking," wrote Sears, who has been a board member of the group for several years. "Unlike David, I was never against same-sex marriage. But much like David, I've witnessed the fallout from broken families in the past several decades, during which divorce and out-of-wedlock births have skyrocketed, and unstable, serial cohabiting relationships have become the norm for raising children." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Sears, whose name frequently appears on lists when there is an important judicial opening, has never opposed same-sex marriage. Sears, a partner at the law firm Schiff Hardin's Atlanta office, was reportedly on the shortlist of candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court a few years back. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog posted an item about Sears’ column and noted that there are three openings on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which decides cases in Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Sears told PolitiFact Georgia she’s "not vying for anything." Sears told us that she’s been purposefully careful not to offer a position on same-sex marriage, particularly when she was on the bench. "By having grown up African-American and female, I wanted to be careful and sensitive to the rights of our gay and lesbian citizens," she said. In 2009, an Associated Press story noted that Sears was criticized by gay rights groups, such as Georgia Equality, for joining the Institute for American Values, because of Blankenhorn’s publicly stated opposition to same-sex marriage. "Anytime someone joins the board of an organization, I think it’s kind of implied that they support the positions of that organization," Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham told PolitiFact Georgia about his group’s criticism of Sears at the time. Despite their criticism, Graham was not aware of any instance in which Sears had publicly stated her position on the issue. Sears said her role at the institute would build on her work with the Georgia Supreme Court toward "strengthening the institution of marriage," by working to reduce the nation’s divorce rate. (The AP reporter who reported that story now works for the AJC. PolitiFact Georgia checked with him about the piece, and he assured us his reporting was accurate.) While she was under consideration for the U.S. Supreme Court, it was noted that Sears had addressed same-sex marriage only indirectly, writing in an opinion that alimony should not be reduced for someone who entered into a homosexual relationship the same way it might be if the person had remarried, because such relationships did not enjoy the same legal protections as marriage. In a 2008 interview with the AJC, Sears was asked if her attendance at a conference on marriage was an indication that she is against same-sex marriage. "We will have a one-hour debate on same-sex marriage which I will facilitate, and I have no view," Sears said as part of her answer. "I've included it as a small part of the conference because I didn't want people to think I was afraid of it." In addition to reviewing Sears’ public statements (or lack of public statements) on the issue, PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed her legal history. She ruled with the Georgia Supreme Court in throwing out the state’s hate-crimes law in 2004 as "unconstitutionally vague"; reinstating Georgia’s gay-marriage ban in 2006; and declining to hear an appeal from a biological mother who wanted to terminate the parental rights of her former lesbian partner in 2007, and in 2004 opposed the state Legislature’s successful attempt to place an anti-same-sex marriage amendment on the ballot. During her Georgia Supreme Court re-election campaign in 1998, one of her two opponents spread the idea that Sears supported same-sex marriage. Sears declined comment; her campaign manager said Sears’ statements used in the accusations were taken out of context. So where does former Georgia Supreme Court Justice Leah Ward Sears stand on same-sex marriage? Earlier this month, she said in a newspaper column that she was "never against same-sex marriage." Never is pretty definitive and PolitiFact Georgia sets the bar high when someone is absolute about whether they’ve said or claimed they’ve never made a particular statement. Sears was careful not to enter the controversial fray during her time on the bench, and from the research we reviewed, she had not taken a public stance on the issue. Still, she went to work a few years ago for a conservative think tank whose leader has been a staunch same-sex opponent, and she told PolitiFact Georgia that she is grappling with her position on the issue. In addition, her legal record while on the Georgia Supreme Court shows she has sided with the majority on rulings that have been cheered and jeered by gay rights activists. We ruled her statement Mostly True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.	None	Leah Ward Sears	None	None	None	2013-02-13T06:00:00	2013-02-05	['None']
pomt-09904	"Obama's Justice-designate Sotomayor threw out (the New Haven firefighters') lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion -- the judicial equivalent of 'talk to the hand.'"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-wrong-about-sotomayor-unsigned-opinion/	Columnist Ann Coulter wrote recently that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor tried to hide her participation in a controversial race discrimination case involving firefighters in New Haven, Conn. In a July 1, 2009, column in Human Events headlined "So much for wise Latinas," Coulter wrote that "Sotomayor threw out their lawsuit in a sneaky, unsigned opinion — the judicial equivalent of 'talk to the hand.'" This part of Coulter's claim is right: The opinion was unsigned. But the truth stops there. In legal terms, "unsigned" means the ruling was "per curiam," or "for the court" — simply, that everyone on the panel agreed with the decision and decided to issue a single opinion. "Generally, an 'unsigned' opinion means the opinion was issued per curiam, meaning no one judge took credit for authoring the opinion, but it represents the opinion of the court," Sarah Ricks, a law professor at Rutgers University who has analyzed types of judicial opinions, wrote us in an e-mail interview. Ricks added that "it is not unusual for a federal appellate court to issue a per curiam opinion; even the Supreme Court very occasionally issues a per curiam opinion. ... A per curiam opinion does not preclude separate opinions by members of the court but it does represent the reasoning for the judgment of the court." Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that "unsigned just means that the three judges agree not to have one author, but all three are agreeing to what the opinion says. It is not uncommon and it is not sneaky. All three judges stand behind the opinion, signed or not." In Ricci vs. DeStefano, more than a dozen white firefighters, as well as one Hispanic, sued New Haven, Conn., for discrimination after the city threw out the results of its lieutenant and captain exams because black firefighters performed disproportionately poorly and wouldn't have been promoted. A federal district court judge found in 2006 that the city was justified. The firefighters appealed, and the case was assigned to a three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that included Sotomayor. In February 2008, the panel issued a summary order, without comment, upholding the lower court's finding. Another 2nd Circuit judge asked the full appeals court to rehear the case, but the court's other judges declined. After that, Sotomayor and her two colleagues on the panel, Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack, issued a new "per curiam" order that adopted the lower court's ruling as their own, calling it "thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned." They also added two paragraphs expressing sympathy for the firefighters who passed the exam but who were not promoted. "In this case, the Civil Service Board found itself in the unfortunate position of having no good alternatives," they wrote. "We are not unsympathetic to the (white firefighters') expression of frustration." So Coulter — an attorney who is billed as the "legal affairs correspondent for Human Events — is seriously distorting what the judges did. The term "unsigned" has nothing to do with judges trying to duck responsibility for the ruling. The suggestion that appellate court judges could somehow hide their participation is preposterous — the judges' names are on every opinion they issue, unsigned or not. In fact, their names are right near the top. So we find Coulter's claim False.	None	Ann Coulter	None	None	None	2009-07-10T17:26:41	2009-07-01	['New_Haven,_Connecticut', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09423	"A government panel that didn't include cancer specialists says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50...If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/16/americans-prosperity/ad-claims-if-health-reform-bill-passes-government-/	A new TV ad from Americans for Prosperity, a group opposing the health reform bill, suggests that screening mammograms for women under 50 would be in jeopardy if the bill passes. The ad, running in 18 key congressional districts through March 18, 2010, features an appeal from breast cancer survivor Tracy Walsh of North Augusta, S.C. "I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 43," Walsh begins. "My mother died of cancer. But early detection saved my life. Now a government panel, that didn't include cancer specialists, says women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. That saves money, but could cost your life. If I had followed the new government guidelines on mammograms, my cancer would have spread undetected, and my chances of survival would have been reduced. If government takes over health care, recommendations like these could become the law for all kinds of diseases." There's an awful lot of misinformation and distortion packed into to these few sentences, and we'll have to take them one at a time. But first, some background. In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations regarding breast cancer screenings, including one that challenged the long-standing convention that women between the ages of 40 and 50 should get routine mammograms. Specifically, the task force dropped the need for regular mammography screenings for women between 40 and 50 from a Grade B to a Grade C. Grade B means there is "high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial" and therefore the screening is recommended. Grade C, however, means that there is "at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small." As a result, the task force recommended against routinely providing the screening unless "other considerations support the offering or providing the service in an individual patient." Enter the Senate version of the health care bill (which is largely the working bill for now). It would create a health care exchange for people who do not get their insurance through their employer. Among other intended benefits, it would allow people in the so-called individual market to get group rates. Private health insurance companies that wish to compete for business in the exchange would have to offer a minimum package of coverage described in the bill. And among those minimum standards, they'd have to cover the entire cost of "evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of 'A' or 'B' in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force." That's the underpinning of the argument from Americans for Prosperity. Now, to unravel some of the distortion. First and foremost, the task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. Diana Petitti, former vice chair of the task force, said the report has been wildly misrepresented on this point. "The report says that when you hit 40, you should start having conversations with your physician about whether you want to have a mammogram," she said. "There is no reason they shouldn't get a mammogram if they decide to get a mammogram. There is nothing in it that attempts to deny or affect the coverage for mammograms for women aged 40 to 49." The report found there was insufficient backing to support the idea that routine mammograms should be automatic for all women 40 to 50, but it noted that there were many women for whom they would be appropriate, and that "the decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms." Among those who should get routine mammograms under 50? Women with a history of cancer in their family, like Walsh, Petitti said. Dr. Petitti also takes umbrage at Walsh's claim that the panel didn't include cancer specialists. She is the former vice chair of the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board and vice chair of an Institute of Medicine committee that issued a report, "Beyond Mammography." Dr. Allen Dietrich is director of Population Sciences at an NCI-designated Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock medical center. And Dr. Sanford Schwartz has also published on the topic of mammography, she noted. In addition, she said, the recommendations were reviewed by oncologists, including a preventive oncologist, and by radiologists. The task force was established to provide an "independent voice" and "sound, evidence-based recommendations for preventive services," said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women's health policy at the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. As for Walsh's comment that not providing mammograms "saves money, but could cost your life," we note that cost-effectiveness was not one of the criteria considered by the task force. It only analyzed the benefits -- early detection of cancer -- against the potential downsides of screening -- mainly stress caused from false-positive test results and the risk of exposure to radiation -- regardless of cost. In short, the panel concluded that based on the evidence, "For biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years, there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is small." Walsh calls the task force recommendation "new government guidelines on mammograms." That's also wrong. The task force is an independent panel convened by the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But their recommendations carry an important disclaimer: "Recommendations made by the USPSTF are independent of the U.S. government. They should not be construed as an official position of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services." In fact, when the task force released its recommendations, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius promptly issued a press release stating, "There is no question that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations have caused a great deal of confusion and worry among women and their families across this country. I want to address that confusion head on. The U.S. Preventive Task Force is an outside independent panel of doctors and scientists who make recommendations. They do not set federal policy and they don't determine what services are covered by the federal government. "There has been debate in this country for years about the age at which routine screening mammograms should begin, and how often they should be given. The Task Force has presented some new evidence for consideration, but our policies remain unchanged. Indeed, I would be very surprised if any private insurance company changed its mammography coverage decisions as a result of this action." Health and Human Services guidelines regarding mammograms did not change. Medicaid still covers the full cost of mammograms for women over 40. And Sebelius was correct that it did not affect private insurance companies' policies regarding mammography coverage. "Our providers continue to provide coverage (of breast cancer screenings) when that is a decision reached between the doctor and patient (even when they are under 50)," said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans. She said she "doesn't have any reason to believe the health bill is going to change" their policy. "Quite the opposite," Pisano said, "we even do outreach to encourage women to do screenings. We will continue to focus on screenings and prevention. That's something we very much believe in." But back to the Senate bill. There are a few other reasons that Walsh's claims about its limits of mammography are misleading. For one, the bill talks about minimum requirements for policies offered on the exchange. "That's the floor in terms of preventive benefits," said Salganicoff, of Kaiser. "Furthermore, there is nothing that stops anyone from covering diagnostic mammograms for women of any age." The Senate bill makes it clear that plans may offer services well beyond the minimum requirements, including mammograms or any other services. "Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in addition to those recommended by United States Preventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for services that are not recommended by such Task Force," the bill states. And if all that weren't enough, legislators went out of their way to ensure that mammograms for women aged 40 to 50 would be covered. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., added an amendment that requires, when it comes to no-cost preventive services offered to women on the exchange, in addition to the services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, they also must include services "provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration." And those HHS guidelines say you've got to cover mammograms for women over 40. Asked in an interview with National Public Radio whether task-force studies like the breast cancer recommendations would be the basis for restricting coverage on the health care exchange, Sebelius said it is the secretary of health and human services — not the advisory panels — who would be have final say on what must be covered. According to NPR, "Asked whether she would be willing to pledge that as long as she remains secretary of health and human services, she will make sure that every plan offered on the exchange will give coverage for annual mammograms for women over 40, Sebelius responded: 'Well, yes. I think that is an important service. It's a determination that we've made.'" Sen. David Vitter, R-La., offered an amendment (which passed) that made it even clearer. "For the purposes of this Act, and for the purposes of any other provision of law, the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Service Task Force regarding breast cancer screening, mammography, and prevention shall be considered the most current other than those issued in or around November 2009." In other words, ignore the November task force ruling altogether. Phil Kerpen, vice president of policy at Americans for Prosperity (which spent $750,000 on the ad) called that a "temporary fix" and said "if the task force upholds that again in its next recommendations (as expected) that will no longer be operative." How worried is the American Cancer Society that Kerpen's scenario might lead to insurers not covering mammograms for women under 50? Not at all. "We're comfortable with the final language and that women 40 and above will continue to have access to mammograms as appropriate," said Stephen Finan, senior director of policy at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The HHS guidelines include mammograms for women over 40, he noted, so "as of now, if everything in the plan today was law, women over 40 would continue to be covered by their insurance." In addition, he noted, 49 states have laws that require mammograms to be covered. The rules vary from state to state, but most require private insurers to pay 100 percent of the cost of mammograms for women over 40. "The fact is, most group plans today provide it anyway as essential, good preventive service," Finan said. The number of plans that don't cover it is very small, he said, and is relegated to "junk plans." One last point: Without any context provided, Walsh's comments leave the impression this issue applies to all Americans. It doesn't. As Kerpen confirmed, she's talking only about people who participate in the health insurance exchange, not people who get their insurance through their employer. The independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that if the health bill passes, four out of five people would continue to get their insurance through their employer. Walsh was covered through her husband's employer, so this whole issue doesn't even apply to her. To review: The task force did not say women shouldn't receive mammograms until age 50. The task force did include experts on cancer screening. It did not factor in cost. The recommendations are not the new government guidelines (in fact, the government guidelines remained the same). In short, this is a bogus issue. If the bill passes, preventive services recommended by the task force would become the bare minimum insurance companies in the exchange would be required to cover. And with regard to mammograms, specifically, they would be covered for women over 40. Americans for Prosperity got the wrong messenger. With a mother who died of cancer, Walsh is practically a poster child for the kind of person who the task force believes ought to get a mammogram before 50. And she gets her insurance through her husband's insurance. Nothing in the health care bill would change how she (or the four out of five Americans like her) would have received care through employer insurance. More importantly, Americans for Prosperity seized on an issue -- free mammograms for women between 40 and 50 -- that was specifically taken care of with not one, but two, Senate amendments.

pomt-08307	"Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that’s raised your electric rates seven times."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/30/tom-perriello/tom-perriello-says-robert-hurt-voted-bill-raised-e/	Electricity has become a hair-raising issue in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District race, with Democratic incumbent Tom Perriello blaming Republican challenger and state Senator Robert Hurt for steep increases in Appalachian Power Company rates. In a recent TV ad replete with "zap!" sound effects, lightning bolt graphics, a frightened kitten and photos of wide-eyed people with static-spiked hair gawking at utility bills, Perriello lays out his claim. "How do most Virginia families react to their electric bills? Pure shock," the ad says. "That’s because Senator Robert Hurt voted for a bill that’s raised your electric rates seven times. Rates have gone up over 50 percent. Those increases also caused factories to close and jobs to be lost. For ignoring your pain, Senator Hurt received over $80,000 from the energy interests. After 10 years in office, Hurt is so out of touch, it’s just plain shocking." While the ad offers plenty of fact-check fodder, PolitiFact Virginia chose to focus on the charge that legislation Hurt voted for in 2007 has been responsible for seven electric rate increases. Asked for the source of the claim, Perriello’s camp pointed to seven Appalachian Power Company rate hikes approved by the State Corporation Commission since 2007. That was the year Hurt, then a member of the state’s House of Delegates, voted for Senate Bill 1416 to establish a new form of electric utility regulation. The law essentially re-regulated electricity supply rates after they were unregulated by the state’s legislature in 1999 to introduce competition to the electric supply business. But the competition failed to materialize. In 2007, the legislation was amended to re-regulate electric rates for both supply and distribution service, but it was an alternative form of re-regulation, not a full return to the way the SCC set rates prior to 1999. The provisions built into the new regulatory model are what some opponents, including Perriello, say allow rates to be higher than they might otherwise be if the SCC had been permitted to regulate rates as it had in the past. Now, back to the claim. Yes, it’s true that Appalachian rates have increased seven times since the 2007 legislation was passed. But let’s take a closer look at why the rates have risen. Appalachian Power’s rates remained essentially flat from the early 1980s to 2005, when the company began to add environmental compliance facilities to coal-burning power plants. Between 2005 and the end of this year, the company will have spent $2 billion on environmental compliance, a cost that the company had to pass on to consumers, said company spokesman Todd Burns. Burns said the company also saw an increase in coal prices in late 2008 and an increase in customer electricity usage. "Those were the three things that stacked up to increase electric rates," he said. "The bottom line is that Virginia regulation didn’t raise rates at all," Burns said. "Regardless of which regulatory structure you come under, electric utilities are permitted to cover environmental compliance, costs and fuel." That’s backed up by a ruling from the State Corporation Commission following the steepest of the rate hikes in 2008. TheSCC said "a significant portion of the increase relates to capital expenditures made to generation and distribution facilities needed to provide service to customers." The SCC’s ruling continued "A large portion of this increase is attributable to environmental improvements made to the generation facilities to comply with federal laws and regulations." Periello’s campaign points out that the seven increases were all filed under the new "2007 legislation." But Burns said that the SCC decided on six of the seven rates increases using the old regulations, adding that the new rate-setting system did not take effect until 2009. According to the State Corporation Commission, that’s partly true. Because the 2007 legislation did more than just re-regulate, some amendments to existing law took effect in 2007 and the rate increases were actually decided by the SCC using a combination of the old regulatory model and new pieces. But Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican, who represents consumers in utility rate cases before the State Corporation Commission, says the increases would have been allowable well before 2007. "Ultimately, the types of costs that APCO has sought to recover in its rate cases (fuel, environmental costs, etc.) would also have been recoverable under the law as it existed not only prior to 2007, but dating back to before the 1999 restructuring law, as well," Cuccinelli wrote in a Sept. 13 commentary piece for the Martinsville Bulletin. Finally, it bears mentioning that when Appalachian’s rates jumped again last December, Hurt was among the legislators to vote for emergency legislation requiring the company to suspend the interim rate charge on customers. So, let’s recap. Yes, Appalachian electric rates have risen seven times since re-regulation legislation was passed with Hurt’s support. And yes, those seven rate increase requests were filed under 2007 legislation. But Perriello is distorting the significance of Hurt’s vote. The reality is that the cases were decided using a combination of the old regulatory system and a few new provisions. The SCC confirms that APCO’s rate increases were substantially the result of outside factors that would have been permissable under the previous legislation. For these reasons, we find the claim to be False.	None	Tom Perriello	None	None	None	2010-10-30T13:00:00	2010-10-12	['Robert_Hurt_(politician)']

pomt-09197	"Kendrick Meek is the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/may/26/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meeks-position-offshore-oil-drilling-rema/	With the Gulf oil spill threatening Florida's pristine beaches and public support for offshore oil drilling waning, Democratic Senate candidate Kendrick Meek of Miami has accused his rivals of backing oil drilling at one time or another, and says he's the only candidate to consistently oppose expanded offshore exploration. He made the argument on his campaign website, where he encouraged people to sign a petition against offshore oil drilling. This is what he wrote: “The recent disaster in the Gulf just underscores the need for a moratorium on any new offshore drilling, but Charlie Crist is busy flip-flopping his stance and Marco Rubio refuses to rule drilling out. Kendrick Meek is the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling.” Meek has largely opposed increased offshore drilling during his congressional tenure. But is he the only candidate consistently opposed to it? We checked with the other major Senate candidates on the issue. Those who have held public office -- Gov. Charlie Crist, former House Speaker Marco Rubio and former Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre -- have publicly declared their positions to various media. Libertarian Alexander Snitker and Jeff Greene, both of whom have never held public office, each stated - for all intents and purposes - their opposition.Here's a more detailed look at each of the candidates: Gov. Charlie Crist: As a candidate for governor in 2006, Crist was unequivocal that he would never support oil drilling off Florida's shores. In 2008, Crist, who was considered a vice presidential running mate with Republican John McCain, backed off his previously staunch opposition. The April 20, 2010, spill convinced him it was risky, and as a result, Crist again became opposed. Clearly, Crist's position on offshore oil drilling has been anything but consistent. Marco Rubio: Rubio has declined to rule out additional offshore drilling. On May 5, 2010, he spoke to reporters in Washington, D.C., about the issue. ‘I've not heard anyone say you cannot safely drill for oil because there are thousands of rigs drilling even as we speak that are not leaking, that are not causing this ecological disaster,'' he said in a story published by the Miami Herald. He later added: ''The question is: 'Should the United States have access to all of its energy resources?' And the answer to me is yes. It has to be done in a way that's safe and clearly not destructive to your environment, to your ecology, or to your economy." Rubio has been consistent, though he does not share Meek's position. Maurice Ferre: The former Miami mayor says he has always been opposed offshore oil drilling. In his position paper, which he shared with PolitiFact Florida, he bluntly wrote that ''the juice from drilling off the Florida coast is not worth the squeeze of putting our larger economy at risk.'' He said he authored the paper with the help of the Everglades Foundation, an opponent of offshore oil drilling. Jeff Greene: Newcomer Greene told the Miami Herald that he has always opposed drilling off Florida's shore. He told the Century Village Democratic Club in West Palm Beach on May 25: ‘‘Why do people come to Florida? The ocean, the coasts, the beaches. This is not a fun extra thing that we have. This is the lifeline of our state. We're not going to have any offshore drilling in Florida. I was against it before, I'm against it now, and I'll be against it forever.’’ Having not held public office, this represents his first public comments on the subject. Alexander Snitker: The Libertarian candidate supports offshore oil drilling, but only under certain conditions. He wants oil companies held responsible for damage and wants the $75 million cap on damages removed, saying it ''creates a ''moral hazard'' for oil companies. Environmental groups who follow Congress on the issue say the four-term lawmaker has remained consistent in his opposition to offshore oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters, which grades lawmakers on their environmental votes, gives Meek high marks for opposing oil drilling, as does Environment America, which tracks votes on environmental issues. Among the votes they monitored: in 2007 he voted against an amendment that would have lifted a drilling moratorium off the Eastern seaboard from Florida to Delaware starting 3 miles off the shore. Meek also was one of 100 U.S. House members in 2003 to sign a letter urging congressional leaders not to open Florida's coastline to offshore drilling. He signed a similar letter in 2005, and in 2006. He also voted in 2006 against a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration within 50 to 100 miles of most coastlines, and within 234 miles of Tampa Bay. When President Barack Obama issued a call in March for expanded offshore oil drilling, Meek gave it a tepid review. But when looking at Meek's voting record since joining Congress in 2003, we found one taken Sept. 16, 2008, on the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill included a provision that would have allowed oil drilling 50 miles beyond shores. First, let’s put the nation's political climate into context. In the fall of 2008, the presidential campaign between Obama and McCain intensified over oil drilling. Amid soaring gas prices and cries of "Drill, Baby, Drill,'' many politicians, including Obama and McCain, reverse coursed and embraced oil drilling. President George W. Bush also had lifted a presidential moratorium on offshore oil drilling, potentially opening the way for drilling within 3 miles of some coastlines. Hammered by the calls, House Democrats began to move away from their longstanding opposition to drilling, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiling the legislation to open up parts of the U.S. coastline, including Florida, to drilling. On Sept. 16, the House voted 236-189 in favor of the bill. Voting ‘‘yes’’ were 221 Democrats, including Meek, and 15 Republicans. Voting ‘‘no’’ were 13 Democrats and 176 Republicans, according to the roll call vote. Pelosi declared the bill's passage as a ‘‘a new direction in energy policy'' and a "bold step forward." Florida Democrats said at the time that the bill stuck by a 2006 compromise that gives Florida's coastline at least a 125-mile buffer in the Gulf of Mexico. But Republicans lampooned the legislation as a sham, designed to give Democrats the illusion of supporting oil drilling, while actually keeping most oil (which happens to be within 50 miles of shore) off limits. House Republican Leader John Boehner condemned it, calling it “a hoax on the American people.’’ The Bush White House also threatened a veto, stating that "this bill purports to open access to American energy sources while in reality taking actions to stifle development." That threat from Bush doomed passage of the legislation in the Senate, where it was never brought up for a vote on the floor. “The issue you raise is not about (Meek’s) change of heart, it's about responding to the Bush administration's decision on the moratorium, and the (House GOP) proposal. Faced with those circumstances, Democrats acted to limit offshore drilling, because otherwise it would have been open season,’’ said Adam Sharon, Meek’s spokesman. That gets us back to Meek’s original statement that he's "the only candidate who has consistently been against expanded drilling." Meek did vote at least one time to expand drilling -- though the legislation only allowed it in limited cases and under specific conditions that probably would never have happened. And his Senate opponents either don’t share his opposition to offshore oil drilling or have not held public office to warrant a documented account of their stance on the issue. So, given the political posturing over the 2008 vote, we rate Meek’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-05-26T18:37:14	2010-05-25	['None']
pomt-04297	Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a "$525-billion tax increase on the middle class."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/01/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-incumbent-/	Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group? That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley. After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says "Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families." The phrase "$525 billion tax increase on the middle class" flashes on the screen. The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup. Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will "add trillions of dollars in debt," a claim we ruled False. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate. But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention. First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion. Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states. For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high. Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see. Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy. They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion). In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class. One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty. Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class? The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more. So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans. How much money is involved? About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion. To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016. Our ruling Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a "$525 billion tax increase on the middle class." The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class. It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class. And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class. The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-02375	Earth "has not warmed for the last 17 years."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/17/patrick-moore/climate-change-skeptic-patrick-moore-says-earth-ha/	Fox News pundit Sean Hannity set the stage for a screaming match on climate change when he invited liberal Bob Beckel of The Five to debate Patrick Moore, a former Greenpeace activist who says there is no proof man is contributing to a warming planet. Beckel criticized Moore for his work as a spokesman for the nuclear energy industry and for saying carbon emissions go back into trees and food rather than the atmosphere. "Come on, Patrick. You know better than that," Beckel said during the March 11 edition of Hannity. But Moore said cries about climate change are actually just about fits of weather. "Basically, they're just saying weather these days," Moore said. "They're saying the weather is climate change, but that's not true. Weather is just weather, like the cold weather we're getting this year. It has not warmed for the last 17 years. We know that for sure. And that brings into question the whole hypothesis." PunditFact wanted to know if the Earth has not warmed for the last 17 years, and what it means if anything for the theory of climate change. We found clues, and seeming contradictions to his claim, in the PolitiFact archive. Lately it’s been hot a lot President Barack Obama warned the nation there will be consequences from not doing more to combat climate change in his 2013 State of the Union address, pointing out "the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15." PolitiFact rated his statement True. (Actually it’s 13 or 14 of the last 15.) But that doesn’t necessarily rule out Moore’s claim about the earth not getting warmer lately. The statements can co-exist, with some additional context. Moore’s claim is a popular argument of people who say climate change isn’t real. The problem is it is cherry-picked and leaves out the rest of the story about earth’s dramatic temperature increases over the last century. NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies tracks global land-ocean temperatures using a temperature index. (The index shows the temperature anomaly of each year. The temperature anomaly shows how a year's land-ocean temperatures compares with the longterm average. A higher anomaly, such as 0.67 degrees Celsius in 2010, shows how much warmer a year was than the longterm average. A negative anomaly, last seen in 1976, indicates a cooler year than the referenced period.) As you can see, Earth’s land-ocean temperatures escalated starting in the 1970s, setting off a new era of rising sea levels, increased greenhouse gas emissions and melting sea ice. Temperatures spiked about 17 years ago in 1998, an outlier year that involved a strong El Niño with abnormally warm ocean temperatures. Since then, temperatures have remained relatively, but not entirely flat. That’s the basis for Moore’s claim. There are several problems with his analysis, however. Data for 2014 isn’t available yet. So really there are only 16 data points (years) between 1998 and 2014. If you include 1997 to the analysis, Moore is clearly wrong. The years 2005 and 2010 were both warmer than 1998, though only slightly. That also makes Moore’s statement technically inaccurate, though most scientists agree that temperatures have remained relatively flat recently. Moore cherry-picked a year when temperatures spiked. "What was an extraordinary event in 1998 is now the new normal," said Goddard Institute program analyst Reto Ruedy, program manager at NASA’s Goddard Institute. Moore would be incorrect if he chose 1999, 1997, 1996 or any year before that. "If you start with an extremely warm year, the warming trend going forward is going to be mostly flat," said Gordon Hamilton, associate research professor at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. "You could easily choose 1999 and 1996 and you would find that there’s an upward trend," said Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "It’s cherry-picking to get the result that he apparently desires." Moore’s response While Moore used the 17-year-statistic on Hannity to make the argument that climate change isn’t happening, he told us the figure "does not prove much." Moore said NOAA and NASA recordkeeping only go back 150 years and the planet’s temperature has fluctuated over the course of time. It is cooler now than for "most of life history," he said. "It is a pause, flat, whatever you want to call it, for 17 years," Moore said. Hamilton and Ruedy dismissed Moore’s qualms, saying the 150-year record is reliable to determine statistically significant trends. For pre-19th century estimates, scientists use other methods, such as tree rings and ice core bubbles, to detect climate trends, Ruedy said. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group operating under the United Nations that reviews climate change research, has concluded the warming of the climate is "unprecedented over decades to millennia." Moore’s Greenpeace ties A final note about Moore. In his interview on Hannity and in many other places, Moore has been described as a "founder" of Greenpeace. The organization, however, disputes that. Greenpeace devotes a webpage to explaining Moore’s lack of credentials, though they agree he was involved in the group’s early days. The group was founded in 1970 as the Don’t Make a Wave Committee with the goal of stopping an American nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. Moore, a college student, wrote a letter to the group in 1971 asking to join the crew of activists sailing to protest the nuclear test. Moore was one of three Greenpeace members on board the Phyllis Cormack, which carried a dozen passengers to Amchitka Island for the protest. Greenpeace says the group’s founders include seven people, but not Moore. Greenpeace leaders voted Moore out of his positions as director of Greenpeace Canada and one of five directors of Greenpeace International, and Moore left in 1986, said Greenpeace spokesman David Pomerantz. He served as a consultant and co-chairman of the nuclear industry-funded Clean and Safe Energy Coalition until he retired from it in 2013. Our ruling Moore said the whole theory of climate change is called into question because "it has not warmed for the last 17 years." It’s true that global surface temperatures have remained relatively flat for 17 years, since 1998. However, both 2005 and 2010 were warmer than 1998. Moore’s statement alone ignores that the first decade of the 21st century was the warmest on record. And Moore is cherry-picking a timeframe to support his argument by starting at an extremely warm year. Global surface temperatures have risen, for instance, if you started at 1999, 1996, or any year before that. Moore’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02097	"Fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/18/robert-malin/ri-anti-poverty-activist-says-fifty-percent-americ/	Millions of people go hungry in the United States every year, despite this being one of the world’s wealthiest nations. But quantifying the problem is difficult. Robert Malin, an activist with the newly formed Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty, offered his view last month: "Fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives," he said during a discussion April 20, 2014, on WJAR-TV’s "10 News Conference." An activist, Malin was with Occupy Providence, which occupied the city’s downtown Burnside Park in 2011 as part of the national grassroots movement. When we asked Malin the basis for his claim, he cited "Transitioning In and Out of Poverty," a 2009 report by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute. Malin directed us to this statement: "Slightly more than half of the U.S. population experiences poverty at some time before the age of 65." That’s very different from what Malin said. Poverty and hunger often correlate. But experts - including the report’s author - underscore that they are not one and the same. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and many nonprofit or non-governmental organizations use the term "food insecurity," that is, "people who lack consistent access to adequate food and are unable at times during the year to acquire adequate food because they lack sufficient money or resources." Plainly stated: they have difficulty putting food on the table. The USDA defines hunger as a physiological condition "that might result from food insecurity." A government panel has recommended a national assessment of hunger. Caroline Ratcliffe, co-author of the Urban Institute Report that Malin cites, said, "The 50 percent number that he quotes echoes findings in the poverty literature that half of the population will be poor before 65." "The percentage of Americans who experience poverty and economic hardship is very high. What we also know, but isn’t exactly the number he cites, is that people who are poor - a lot of them are food insecure," Ratcliffe said. The numbers "move together, but they are not the same thing," Ratcliffe said. We also interviewed Alisha J. Coleman-Jensen, PhD, a sociologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service and author of numerous articles and reports on household food insecurity. That includes "Household Food Security in the United States in 2012." In 2012, "by our estimate, 14.5 percent of households were food insecure," she said. That translates to roughly 49 million people in 17.6 million households. Of those, "5.7 percent of households are at a high risk for food insecurity, meaning they are not getting enough to eat, have disrupted eating patterns or go whole days without food.Those numbers are "not anywhere near 50 percent." As for Malin’s claim, "I don’t know where that’s from ... I haven’t seen that figure anywhere." Coleman-Jensen wondered aloud if Malin had misinterpreted the close to 50 million people living in food-insecure households as 50 percent. "If they’re talking about somebody going hungry at any point in their lives … we do not have data that would allow us to measure the percent of people who will experience food insecurity or low food security ‘at some point in their lives.’’’ She noted that "our data [are] for a single year." Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University, in St. Louis, has conducted research that found that half of all American children will at some point be in a household that uses food stamps. But he said he knew of no studies that addressed lifetime risk of hunger. "One could argue that if you’re using food stamps you’re at risk of experiencing hunger, but that would be as far as one could go," Rank said. Kathleen Gorman, director of the University of Rhode Island’s Feinstein Center for a Hunger-Free America, says she does not find Malin’s statement unreasonable, "but it is extremely difficult to prove." "First of all, we do not have any good measures of ‘hunger’ -- it is a pretty amorphous idea. When we measure hunger, we typically use the USDA Household Food Security survey -- and while they are not identical, most people accept that one is an indicator of the other," she said. Our ruling Anti-poverty activist Robert Malin said half of all Americans will go hungry at some point in their lives. Experts we talked with knew of no research that supported Malin’s claim. And studies show the percentage of Americans facing "food insecurity" annually is closer to 15 percent. Some studies, however, have found that half of all Americans will be poor at some point in their lives. And researchers say hunger and poverty are linked. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07155	"Taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin! And 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee!!!"	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/14/michelle-litjens/wisconsin-gop-rep-michelle-litjens-says-taxpayers-/	Some of the biggest bashers of government entitlement programs are tea party folks, many of whom are newly elected officials. Among them is Wisconsin state Rep. Michelle Litjens, R-Oshkosh. While campaigning ahead of the November 2010 elections, she organized the tea party rally where another Oshkosh Republican, Ron Johnson, gave his first political speech. Johnson went on to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold for the U.S. Senate. Like Johnson, during her campaign, Litjens railed against government spending and taxes as being too high. And on June 2, 2011, Litjens, a 38-year-old married mother of two, let loose on the Internet with this anti-entitlement tweet: "Unreal! Taxpayers pay for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin! And 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee!!! No wonder we’re broke." A misinformed right-wing rant? Or evidence of the pervasiveness of public assistance, which many conservatives blame for high taxes and government deficits? We wanted to know. We’ll go to the Truth-O-Meter only for the statistical claims in Litjens' statement. But to add perspective, we’ll also address her "we’re broke" comment. When we asked Litjens’ legislative aide for evidence to back her statement, he provided Wisconsin birth statistics from the state Department of Health Services for 2008. We confirmed that they are the most recent available in terms of taxpayer funding. The figures show that 71,977 babies were born in Wisconsin in 2008 -- and that Medicaid, the state-federal program that pays medical bills for low-income individuals and families, paid for the care provided in 32,792 of the births. That’s 45.6 percent, which confirms Litjens’ first claim. The 45.6 percent figure -- it was 44 percent in ‘07, 43 percent in ‘06 and 42 percent in ‘05 -- put Wisconsin on the higher end of Medicaid-financed births nationally in 2008. That’s according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy. The rate ranged from 8 percent in New Jersey to 70 percent in Louisiana, although figures were not available for 15 states. As for Litjens’ second claim, that taxpayers paid for 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee, she didn’t specify whether she meant Milwaukee County or the City of Milwaukee. But either way, her claim is accurate. State figures show there were 15,353 births in the county in 2008, and that Medicaid paid for the care of 9,170 of them, or 59.7 percent. In the city, Medicaid paid for 72.5 percent of the 11,311 births. Here’s a little more on the state statistics for 2008 births: Over 85 percent of the 130 births in Menominee County were paid for by Medicaid, the highest percentage in Wisconsin. In Ozaukee County, Medicaid paid for 19 percent of the 822 births, the lowest rate. In Litjens’ home county, Winnebago, Medicaid paid for nearly 39 percent of the 1,955 births. Medicaid, by the way, pays for more than just labor and delivery. It also finances prenatal visits and postpartum care. We asked Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based advocacy organization, about Litjens’ statement. He didn’t disagree with the statistics, but took issue with her suggestion that Medicaid-financed births are one reason "we’re broke." Peacock said prenatal care provided through Medicaid saves tax dollars by reducing the number of low-birth-weight babies. He cited a November 2010 state health department report about births in five Wisconsin counties in 2005. The average Medicaid hospital charges for a low-birth-weigh baby during the first year of life was $164,257, compared with $3,514 for a normal-birth-weight birth. Peacock also said that the elderly and people with disabilities account for at least 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures, far more than babies. But critics of entitlement programs can also cite statistics about the size of the government safety net. An October 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which reported that Medicaid paid for 45 percent of all baby deliveries in Wisconsin in 2008, also reported that at that time: More than 1.1 million people in Wisconsin depended on Medicaid health programs. Medicaid provided health care for one in five Wisconsin residents. Medicaid health programs had expanded faster in Wisconsin over the previous nine years than in any state except Arizona. But let’s return to what brought us here. GOP state Rep. Michelle Litjens claimed that taxpayers paid for roughly 45 percent of all births in Wisconsin, including 60 percent of the births in Milwaukee. Her staff said she was referring to state figures for 2008, which we confirmed are the most recent available in terms of how many of the births were financed by Medicaid. State statistics confirm both of Litjens’ claims. We rate her statement True.	None	Michelle Litjens	None	None	None	2011-06-14T09:00:00	2011-06-02	['Wisconsin', 'Milwaukee']

pomt-03961	Says he "has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel’s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-said-he-has-repeatedly-praised-chuck-hage/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has drawn fire from Democrats for his questions of Chuck Hagel, maintains that critics overlook his positive references to Hagel, the former two-term Nebraska senator nominated for secretary of Defense. At Hagel’s confirmation hearings, Cruz employed video clips of Hagel being interviewed by Al-Jazeera to suggest the nominee espoused views hostile to Israel, Politico summarized Feb. 14, 2013, and during a committee vote, Cruz criticized Hagel’s failure to reveal details of his personal compensation from 2008 to 2010, asking whether North Korean sources may have funneled $200,000 to the defense nominee. The senator’s questions are not attacks, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier later said, according to a Feb. 14, 2013, post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers blog. Frazier continued: "Sen. Cruz has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel’s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation — at the confirmation hearing, in writing, and at the committee hearing casting his vote on Senator Hagel’s nomination." He has? President Barack Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran and former newscaster who served as a Republican senator through early 2009, on Jan. 7, 2013. The Morning News report opened by saying that Cruz, a freshman Republican, was being likened by critics to Joe McCarthy, the late Wisconsin senator whose crusade against communists in government devolved into doubts about his legitimacy. On Feb. 12, 2013, as the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel’s nomination on a 14-11 party line vote, the News said, Cruz suggested that Hagel had taken money under the table from adversaries. "We do not know, for example, if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups," Cruz said before the committee vote. "It is at a minimum relevant to know if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea." Cruz demanded financial disclosures from Hagel covering five years, three more than required, the News reported, and the Texan said that without that, the "only reasonable inference" is that "there was something in there that they did not want to make public." At the hearing, Politico reported, Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and John McCain, R-Ariz., rebuked Cruz for "what they considered an unfair line of questioning allegedly impugning Hagel’s patriotism." Nelson chastised Cruz for violating standards of "comity and civility that this committee has always been known for….To question in essence whether somebody is a fellow traveler with another country, I think is taking it too far….You basically have impugned the patriotism of the nominee." Subsequently, the News said, left-leaning pundits compared Cruz’s statement to those aired during the 1950s Red Scare – intimidation by insinuation. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., referred to Cruz’s assertions as "innuendo" that lacked factual basis. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., made an allusion to McCarthy, recalling a time when senators would make insinuations by claiming to have a speech someone once made in his pocket, casting aspersions without producing evidence. "It was reminiscent of some bad times," she said, according to the News. By email, Frazier told us that Cruz’s praise of Hagel shows up in video of the committee proceedings, committee transcripts and published articles by Cruz. Cruz’s Jan. 7, 2013, USA Today opinion column opens by calling Hagel a "war hero and public official who has served America honorably. However," it continues, "his views on foreign and defense policy are out of the mainstream, and he is not a good fit for secretary of Defense." The remaining 280 words give reasons not to back Hagel. A Cruz opinion column posted by Politico on Feb. 1, 2013, opens: "Chuck Hagel is a decorated Vietnam veteran with an honorable history fighting for his country, and I commend his personal valor and sacrifice." The rest of the 800-word article covers Cruz concerns about the nominee. Cruz praised Hagel in two moments during meetings of the Armed Services committee. On Jan. 31, 2013, according to a hearing transcript, Cruz prefaced his questioning of Hagel by saying: "I want to begin by thanking you for your honorable service to our nation, for your personal sacrifice that you have put in to standing and fighting for this country." And on Feb. 12, Cruz prefaced his echo of a newspaper saying Hagel’s foreign policy views put him on the Senate’s fringe by saying: "And Sen. Hagel, although I very much respect his personal heroism and character and service, putting his life on the line defending this nation," according to a transcript. Cruz separately issued press releases questioning Hagel’s nomination on Jan. 7 and Feb. 14, 2013. The combined 324 words include no praise. Our ruling Cruz’s office says he has "repeatedly praised" Hagel’s "character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation." We found four instances, but in each one--and in others where he aired no praise--Cruz hammered what he calls Hagel’s shortcomings so much so that some colleagues cried foul. The missing context of this claim is that every time, Cruz's praise has been overshadowed by pointed questions and/or critiques. Mark this statement Half True.

pomt-08228	Said they reached a "power-sharing agreement" with Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/17/republican-state-senators/georgia-senate-leaders-claim-power-sharing-lieuten/	There was a time when the future looked very bright for Republican Casey Cagle, Georgia's lieutenant governor. He was young and riding the rising tide of a Republican takeover of what had once been a state dominated by Democrats. The governor's office seemed well within his reach. All he had to do was put a couple of terms as the state Senate's leader behind him, line up the campaign donors and then start measuring the curtains in the chief executive's suite. But these days, the doe-eyed Cagle looks more like a deer in the headlights, thanks to a rebellious group of his fellow Republican senators who have staged a lightning-quick palace coup, striking hard and fast at the man who was to have been their leader. The Nov. 2 election returns had barely been counted when the Republican caucus met in Macon in a closed-door session at Mercer University. With a voice vote, Republicans removed Cagle’s power to appoint Senate committee chairmen, which is the key to real influence in the upper chamber. They also stripped Cagle of the ability to decide the makeup of Senate committees. The lieutenant governor will be allowed to direct legislation to particular committees, but he can do that only under the supervision of the Senate membership. Cagle does still preside over the Senate, and he has the bully pulpit of the upper chamber at his disposal. And he can -- apparently -- still appoint senators to important conference committees to iron out House-Senate differences in legislation. However, that power also could come under attack when senators meet next month in Athens in a pre-session gathering. One newspaper columnist noted after the Nov. 5 Macon meeting that Cagle had been relegated to little more than a hall monitor. GOP leaders, however, painted a different picture. "This is simply a new power-sharing agreement that we’ve come to," Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers, R-Woodstock, told reporters. That sentiment was echoed by other GOP leaders. PolitiFact Georgia wondered who's correct. Does Cagle retain important Senate powers? Or has he been reduced to figurehead? First, a little background about all the intraparty back-stabbing. During the last legislative session, Cagle inserted his Senate allies into the middle of a Republican brawl over Gov. Sonny Perdue's proposal to levy a tax on hospitals and other health facilities. Cagle backed the idea, but some key committee chairmen in the Senate vigorously opposed it. They claimed Cagle never consulted them before pledging their support. Cagle retaliated, stripping the chairmanships of Sens. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, and Preston Smith, R-Rome, two of four Republicans who voted against Perdue's proposal. Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, of Sharpsburg, resigned his position as party whip. That set the stage for a very uncivil war if Cagle won re-election. Which he did, easily, against Democrat Carol Porter. Ironically, Cagle campaigned against Porter by warning Georgia voters that Senate Republicans would immediately strip her of her Senate powers if she won. Emory University political scientist Merle Black said Cagle now finds himself in the same situation faced by former Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who was stripped of his power by the new GOP majority in 2003. "They've turned him into a nominal lieutenant governor -- lieutenant governor in name only," Black said. "I think they've really limited his career opportunities." Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said the GOP Senate leaders have essentially "marginalized" the lieutenant governor. "There is no doubt his power has been diminished by this," Swint said. "He's not powerless, but his power has certainly been diminished." Cagle spokesman Ben Fry had this to say about all the shenanigans: "While some may be playing political games, the lieutenant governor remains committed to delivering results, which is exactly what the voters just overwhelmingly elected him to do. He is not going to let procedural hurdles get in the way of his passion for creating jobs and making the difficult decisions necessary to balance the budget and move our state forward." But the facts are clear. Power in the Senate has shifted, and shifted dramatically. The real clout in the Senate now will be wielded by an eight-member committee. That body is composed of President Pro Tem Tommie Williams, five GOP caucus officers and two Senate appointees by Cagle. Cagle was expressly prohibited from membership on the committee. This is "power sharing" all right. In the aftermath of the Macon coup, the GOP Senate leadership now has all the power. And it doesn't plan to share it with Cagle. We find the GOP claim about power sharing with the lieutenant governor not only not accurate. It's ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-01815	The number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton’s presidency was "a hundred times" what it was under President Ronald Reagan.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-economic-stats-were-100-times/	With the nation mired in a long, slow recovery from the Great Recession, the past tends to have a rosy glow. Republicans like to tout the halcyon days of President Ronald Reagan, while Democrats fondly remember the era of President Bill Clinton. During a recent interview on the Charlie Rose show on PBS, Hillary Clinton -- who had a front-row seat for the Bill Clinton era as first lady -- made clear her economic role model as she continues to weigh a 2016 presidential run. "If I just were to compare Reagan’s eight years with Bill’s eight years, it’s like night and day in terms of the effects," Clinton said during the July 17, 2014, interview. "The number of jobs that were created, the number of people lifted out of poverty, a hundred times more when Bill was president. And did policies have something to do with that? I would argue that they did." Really? Were the Clinton years, statistically, 100 times better than the Reagan years? A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. The comparison is actually pretty fair. Both presidents entered office during a weak economic time and exited before the economy went into a downturn. We’ll analyze employment first, and then poverty. We looked at two different date ranges, each of which could plausibly be defined as the duration of their presidency. One was 1980 through 1988 for Reagan and 1992 to 2000 for Clinton. The other was 1981 through 1989 for Reagan and 1993 through 2001 for Clinton. For simplicity, we’ll only write below about one option -- the latter one. The patterns are broadly similar regardless of what range of years you use. Job creation For job creation, we looked at the two most common yardsticks for employment tracked by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- total nonfarm employment, and the unemployment rate. For consistency, we used January’s monthly figures for each year. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of employed people went up by 16.1 million, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of employed people went up by 22.9 million, or an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. So while both presidents did well, the number of employed people rose faster under Clinton, both in raw numbers and by percentage. What about the unemployment rate? Under Reagan, it fell from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent -- a drop of 2.1 percentage points. Under Clinton, it fell from 7.3 percent to 4.2 percent -- a drop of 3.1 percentage points. So here, too, both presidents chalked up good marks over eight years, but Clinton’s record on job creation over Reagan was modestly superior. Poverty For poverty, we looked at figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, which has tracked poverty figures for decades. We looked at both raw numbers of people in poverty and the poverty rate. During the eight years under Reagan, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 294,000, or a drop in raw numbers of about 1 percent. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million, or a drop in raw numbers of about 17 percent. So both presidents oversaw a decline in the raw numbers of people in poverty, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Next, we looked at the poverty rate -- the percent of all Americans who are impoverished. During the eight years under Reagan, the poverty rate fell from 14 percent to 12.8 percent, or a decline of 1.2 percentage points. During the eight years under Clinton, the poverty rate fell from 15.1 percent to 11.7 percent, or a decline of 3.4 percentage points. So, once again, the poverty rate declined under both presidents, but the decline was bigger under Clinton. Was the improvement ‘a hundred times’ better under Clinton? Put it all together and it’s a vast exaggeration to say Clinton’s record is 100 times better than Reagan’s. Even allowing for some over-enthusiasm on Clinton’s part, the differences are fairly modest. The biggest gap comes from the percentage decrease in impoverished Americans. The decline in raw numbers under Clinton was 17 times greater than under Reagan. But the other metrics are closer. The poverty rate fell close to three times faster under Clinton; the unemployment rate fell 50 percent faster under Clinton; and the number of employed Americans rose 17 percent faster under Clinton. We did not hear back from Clinton’s camp. However, we would be skeptical of the argument that her claim was simply a harmless exaggeration for rhetorical effect. She posits a massive difference in economic improvement under Clinton as opposed to Reagan. In reality, both saw notable improvements, even though Clinton’s were stronger across the board. We also reviewed the video of the interview and didn’t detect any obvious sign that Clinton said it facetiously. Our ruling Clinton said the number of jobs created and people lifted out of poverty during Bill Clinton’s presidency was "a hundred times" what it was under President Ronald Reagan. Clinton’s record does outpace Reagan’s on the four statistical measures we looked at. But the differences are not like night and day, as her phrasing claims. Both presidents saw improvements, with Clinton’s being incrementally better -- not 100 times better. We rate the claim False.

pomt-09963	The federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act bill would create "special protection for pedophiles."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/14/steve-king/rep-steve-king-claims-federal-hate-crime-law-would/	With the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act moving swiftly through Congress, and President Barack Obama committed to sign it, opponents have ratcheted up their rhetoric and complained about a provision that would add "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the list of hate crime categories. In a Fox News interview on May 6, 2009, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the "sexual orientation" wording would provide "special protection to pedophiles." "The definition for sexual orientation was defined by one of the principal authors, Tammy Baldwin of Madison, Wisconsin, as being either heterosexual or homosexual. Well, so within that definition, though, of sexual orientation by the American Psychological Association you've got a whole list of proclivities — they call them paraphilias — and in that list, among them are pedophiles. "And so I don't want special protective status for a pedophile when a regular person would get less — lesser protection under this law. ... This sets up sacred cows in this legislation. So some people are protected more than others in this society." King was so concerned about that possibility that he sought to amend the bill to specifically exclude pedophiles. On the House floor on April 29, 2009, King argued that the lack of a definition of "sexual orientation" in the law would open the door to special protections for people with all kinds of deviant sexual proclivities. "My amendment does not specifically define sexual orientation, although I've tried to do that," King said. "But what it does do is say it doesn't include pedophiles because I think the intent of this committee is clearly that we don't want to provide a, let's just say, a sexual — a special protected status for pedophiles. There are others that I would put in that list as well, but this is the one that stands out to me that should be beyond question that this committee should be able to take a look at this amendment and conclude that whatever we might think about proclivities, pedophiles is not one that should be included." Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, went one step further, suggesting that victims of sex crimes could be guilty of a hate crime if they tried to defend themselves or retaliate against an attacker. "If a mother hears that their child has been raped and she slaps the assailant with her purse, she is now gone after as a hate criminal because this is a protected class. There are other protected classes in here. I mean, simple exhibitionism — I have female friends who have told me over the years that some guy flashed them and their immediate reaction was to hit them with the purse. Well, now, he's committed a misdemeanor. She has committed a federal hate crime because the exhibitionism is protected under sexual orientation," Gohmert said. "The plain meaning of sexual orientation is anything to which someone is sexually oriented. That could include exhibitionism. It can include necrophilia. It could include ... voyeurism. You see somebody spying on you changing clothes and you hit them, they've committed a misdemeanor. You've committed a federal felony under this bill." Their arguments gained a wider audience through postings on the conservative Web site RightMarch.com, which were e-mailed to subscribers of the conservative publication Human Events . The King amendment failed. Opponents said it was unnecessary, that pedophilia was not covered under the definition of sexual orientation. And the Hate Crime Prevention Act passed the House 249-175. A similar bill is pending in the Senate. Many legal scholars we spoke with said King and Gohmert were wrong that pedophiles and other sexual deviants would get special protections from the bill. And supporters of the bill were more blunt, saying the arguments were ridiculous scare tactics. The opponents' arguments display a fundamental misunderstanding of the words "sexual orientation," said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation. "Pedophilia and sexual orientation are two different things," Leonard said. Sexual orientation, he said, relates to the gender to which a person is romantically attracted while pedophilia relates to age, adults who are sexually fixated on children. Leonard believes it is an attempt by legislators to appeal to their constituents' "yahoo mentality." James Jacobs, an adjunct professor of law at New York University Law School, has been an outspoken critic of hate crime laws. He thinks they are unnecessary, amount to "recriminalizing activities that are already criminal" and are the product of political grandstanding. But even he doesn't buy King's arguments about pedophilia. "I don't think pedophilia would count as sexual orientation," Jacobs said. "It's not a very persuasive argument." We went to Black's Law Dictionary , which defines sexual orientation this way: "A person's predisposition or inclination toward a particular type of sexual activity or behavior; heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality." That first part seems to lend some weight to King's argument. But that ignores the working definition used by the federal government for years, said Michael Lieberman, Washington counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, which has fought for the federal legislation for years. The FBI's Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines, prepared in response to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, defines "sexual orientation bias" as "a preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons based on their sexual attraction toward, and responsiveness to, members of their own sex or members of the opposite sex, e.g., gays, lesbians, heterosexuals." Furthermore, Lieberman said, it ignores decades of history with state hate crime laws. There are currently 31 states that have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation. "There are no cases, zero, at the federal or state level that even remotely resemble what Rep. King and other opponents have talked about," Lieberman said. "It's make-believe." "It's laughable," said Jack Levin, professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University and co-chair of the Center on Violence and Conflict. "Why should it happen at the federal level when it hasn't happened at the state level. They are setting up a straw man. ... It's a convenient way of arousing public fear about something that is quite benign." Said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino: "The assertion that the law is designed in an effort to protect pedophiles is not only without merit, it is an affront to anyone who has been a victim of a hate crime. I think it's a bigoted a scare tactic designed to further denigrate gay and lesbian Americans. I'm disgusted that this has become a part of the debate." So we've found nothing to support the opponents' claims that pedophiles would be protected by the hate crimes bill. The experience of 31 states that have similar laws, the FBI's definition of sexual orientation and the opinions of legal experts have persuaded us not only that the opponents are wrong, but that their arguments are preposterous. We find King's claim to be Pants on Fire.	None	Steve King	None	None	None	2009-05-14T17:43:42	2009-05-06	['None']

pomt-06215	Says Mitt Romney belittled middle-class tax cuts "as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.' "	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/dec/07/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mitt-romney-called-middle-cl/	As the president pressured Congress to extend his payroll tax cut, Florida Democrats issued a statement calling Republican opposition "shameful." "With Republicans like Mitt Romney belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids,' the Republican Party is sending a clear signal to the American people: they are willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and big oil," says a quote from Florida Democratic Party executive director Scott Arceneaux. The phrase "little Band-Aids" caught our eye. Did Mitt Romney really use that phrase to describe tax cuts for the middle-class? We asked Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan, who issued the Dec. 1, 2011, release, contacted the Romney campaign and searched for the phrase ourselves. What emerged wasn't quite what Democrats had claimed. What Romney said Romney did use the phrase "little Band-Aids" in an Oct. 11 presidential debate, in his answer to a question about Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. Here's how the exchange with Bloomberg TV White House correspondent Juliana Goldman unfolded: GOLDMAN: "Gov. Romney, I want to ask you, because President Obama's jobs bill stalled in the Senate today, and so it may have to be broken into component parts for Congress to vote on. "If the payroll tax cut is not extended, that would mean a tax increase for all Americans. What would be the consequences of that?" ROMNEY: "No one likes to see tax increases, but look, the stimulus bills the president comes out with that are supposedly going to create jobs, we have now seen this played in the theater several times, and what we're seeing has not worked. "The American people know that when he went into office and borrowed $800 billion for a massive job stimulus program, then they did not see the jobs. Some of those green jobs we were supposed to get, that is money down the drain. "The right course for America is not to keep spending money on stimulus bills, but instead to make permanent changes to the tax code. Look, when you give -- as the president's bill does, if you give a temporary change to the payroll tax, and you say, we're going to extend this for a year or two, employers do not hire people for a year or two. "They make an investment in a person that goes over a long period of time. And so if you want to get the economy going again, you have to have people who understand how employers think, what it takes to create jobs. "And what it takes to create jobs is more than just a temporary shift in a tax stimulus, it needs instead fundamental restructuring of our economy to make that sure we are the most attractive place in the world for investment, for innovation, for growth, and for hiring. And we can do that again." GOLDMAN: "So you would be okay with seeing the payroll tax cuts?" ROMNEY: "Look, I don't like temporary little Band-Aids, I want to fundamentally restructure America's foundation economically." Democrats seized on the conversation as evidence that Romney opposed extending payroll tax cuts, which the Obama administration says save a typical family $1,000 a year. Within days, the Democratic National Committee rolled out "Operation Band-Aids," including a Web video, conference calls and events. "By opposing the extension of middle-class tax cuts, (Romney) is supporting a tax increase on middle-income families and small businesses," POLITICO quoted DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse as saying. Romney's tax plan Of course, a closer reading of the debate shows Romney opposed the tax cuts, not on their merits or because of whom they would benefit but rather as temporary cuts rather than long-term changes. The right course, he said, was "to make permanent changes to the tax code." He criticized "a temporary change to the payroll tax," calling it "a temporary shift in a tax stimulus" before he concluded he didn't like "temporary little Band-Aids." His opposition to temporary tax code fixes wasn't a new point. Page 39 of his economic plan, released in early September, says, "President Obama’s proclivity for fostering uncertainty about the long-term shape of the tax code is particularly troublesome. He has embraced one temporary solution after the next while rejecting permanent adjustments that would bring some predictability and stability to investment decision-making." That's the essence of his Oct. 11 debate answer. And it's scarcely a blanket opposition to "middle-class tax cuts," as Democrats characterized it. In fact, he had previously exempted the payroll tax cut extension from his criticism. On Page 47, he mentioned some short-term measures he would support — and a "lower payroll tax" is among them. "Notwithstanding President Obama’s counterproductive meddling in the tax code, there are some short-term measures that — far from increasing uncertainty and discouraging job creators — can serve as powerful incentives for investment and hiring. These short-term measures are very much the subject of current discussion and debate in Washington. Some of them may even be proposed by President Obama in the coming days. "A robust investment tax credit, extending the write-off for capital expenditures for an additional year, and a lower payroll tax could each have a positive effect if properly structured. But such measures are no substitute for the longer-term structural reforms to our tax system that are required to place the economy on sound footing for a recovery." So the Democrats were right to seize on Romney's debate answer in one sense: It differed from his on-the-record support for "a lower payroll tax" as distinct from other "counterproductive" short-term measures. In the debate, he instead grouped Obama's proposed tax cut extension into his criticism of short-term fixes. That departure didn't last long. Days after Florida Democrats' news release, Romney returned to the talking points of his published economic plan in an appearance on Michael Medved's conservative radio talk show: "I would like to see the payroll tax cut extended just because I know that working families are really feeling the pinch right now — middle-class Americans are having a hard time," he said on the Dec. 5 show, as reported by the New York Times and others. Meanwhile, the details of his economic plan, while too vague for a complete analysis, appear to support lower taxes for the middle class, according to Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. The center maintains a summary of Republican candidates' tax proposals. "He wants lower rates in the future for taxes," Williams said. "... I would say it's not fair to say he doesn't care about the little guys." Romney would maintain President George W. Bush's tax cuts, which include cuts for the middle class (though also, of course, for the rich). He wants to reduce to zero investment taxes for low- and middle-income families to boost their retirement savings — something he doesn't offer to do for those with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000. In the long-term, he wants to broaden the tax base and reduce and flatten tax rates, which would likely favor the wealthy more than anyone else, Williams said, but he would keep exemptions, deductions, credits, and other tax preferences in the short-term, many of which benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers. He wants lower rates across the board. And, as we said, his published plan says he supports a temporary reduction in the payroll tax "if properly structured." Our ruling Florida Democrats used Romney as an example of a Republican "willing to raise taxes on middle-class Americans just to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires." They accused him of "belittling middle-class tax cuts as nothing more than 'little Band-Aids.'" But the context of his Oct. 11 debate performance shows he decries not "middle-class tax cuts," but "a temporary change to the payroll tax" as part of a stimulus bill. He argued, essentially, for permanently lower tax rates, including for the middle class. Meanwhile, the debate performance stands as an exception to Romney's published support for lowering payroll taxes. Democrats get some credit for accurately pointing out that in the debate, Romney didn't support Obama's effort to extend his payroll tax cut. He did indeed call temporary tax changes "little Band-Aids." But they ignore critical context from the debate and Romney's published tax proposals when they declare he belittled "middle-class tax cuts," creating the impression he opposes middle class-tax breaks.

pomt-10384	Obama "wants a windfall profits tax on oil to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/18/john-mccain/yes-obama-wants-to-tax-windfall-profits/	As the candidates jockey over energy policies and offshore drilling, Sen. John McCain has been criticizing Sen. Barack Obama for wanting to raise taxes. "He wants a windfall profits tax on oil, to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas," McCain said in a June 18, 2008, speech in Houston. "If the plan sounds familiar, it's because that was President Jimmy Carter's big idea too — and a lot of good it did us." Indeed, McCain is right that Obama supports a windfall profits tax, which would be levied on oil companies to capture some of their profits from rising prices. "I'll make oil companies like Exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits, and we'll use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills," Obama said in a speech June 9. A windfall tax — actually an excise tax imposed on the difference between the market price of oil and an adjusted base price — was enacted in 1980 but repealed in 1988. By then, oil prices had dropped, it was generating little or no revenue and there were concerns that it made the United States more dependent on foreign oil. Many Democrats want to bring it back to discourage oil companies from raising prices. We couldn't find many details about Obama's windfall-profits proposal except that he would use it for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor pay their heating and cooling bills. As for the other part of McCain's claim, that Obama wants new taxes for coal and natural gas, the details are more sketchy. The McCain campaign cites a February 2008 interview of Obama with San Antonio Express-News columnist Carlos Guerra. In that interview, Obama first answered a question about funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, "Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?" Obama replied: "Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts." We couldn't find any other references to new taxes on coal or natural gas on the Obama's campaign Web site, although we found several items where Obama wants incentives for clean coal. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the campaign, said Obama was referring to his proposal for a cap-and-trade system for global warming. Still, it's clear from the context that the coal and natural gas comment was more an aside than an announcement of a major new tax proposal. But regardless, Obama said what he said: "What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas." He may not have a detailed position paper on it, but it seems to be an overall statement of his beliefs and the Obama campaign did not dispute that he said it. So we find McCain's claim to be Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-18T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['None']
pomt-11128	"Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jun/04/patrick-mchenry/nc-republican-repeats-false-tax-claim/	With midterm elections approaching, U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry is following in President Donald Trump’s footsteps on the campaign trail. McHenry, a Republican from Western North Carolina, distributed a newsletter on May 29 that targets the "liberal news media" and boasts about changes to the federal tax code that Congress passed last year. "Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year, and Americans all over the country — including right here in Western North Carolina — are saving more of their hard-earned money each paycheck thanks to President Donald J. Trump," McHenry’s newsletter says. It asks for campaign donations, warning: "Obstructionist liberals are working nonstop to discredit our Make America Great Again agenda and thwart any progress for our great nation." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Claims about last year’s tax cuts being the "biggest" in American history — a frequent talking point of Trump himself — have already been debunked by PolitiFact. It’s unclear why McHenry’s campaign made the claim. The campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Measuring cuts The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax cuts and increases between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the overall economy). Depending on what projection of the recent tax cut you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. When measured by inflation-adjusted dollars, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) was the biggest cut since 1940 and last year’s tax cut ranks as the fourth-biggest. ' See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When measured by the cut’s percentage of GDP, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is the largest tax cut and last year’s tax cut falls to seventh. ' See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Looking at GDP Economists generally prefer to measure the depth of tax cuts by their impact on GDP, said Michael Walden, economics professor at North Carolina State University. "[A]s the economy (GDP) becomes larger, it takes a bigger tax cut in dollar terms to have the same impact," Walden wrote in an email. Comparing tax cuts this way, "shows the Trump cuts ranked 5th among tax reduction legislation passed since 1964," he said, referencing a CNN analysis from earlier this year. So the depth of last year’s cuts have been overstated. As for who benefits, PolitiFact found that the cuts last the longest for the wealthiest Americans. Our ruling McHenry said "Americans received the biggest tax cut in history last year." That statement, which Trump has repeated, wasn’t true when he said it and it’s not true now. We rate it False.

pomt-08176	"The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- the top 1 percent of income in this country -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/30/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-going-down-swinging-bush-tax-cut-exte/	File this under the category of things that won't surprise you -- Alan Grayson isn't leaving office quietly. The Orlando Democrat who lost his bid for re-election took to the U.S. House floor on Nov. 17, 2010, to rail against Republicans who want to extend the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for all Americans, including the wealthiest 1 percent of income earners. With a series of cardboard posters, Grayson mocked Republicans for more than five minutes. "The Republican plan for tax cuts is to give each millionaire -- each person who makes $1.4 million a year on average, the top 1 percent of income in this country, the high and mighty -- $83,347 a year in tax cuts," Grayson said, turning to his posters. Grayson said the wealthiest could use the money to buy a 2011 Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, once a year, every year for the next decade. Or they could buy a Hermes "Birkin" handbag every year or a bottle of 1787 Chateau d'Yquem wine. "Here's something else they can do," Grayson said, showing the next poster. "They can buy 20,000 jars of their favorite mustard, Grey Poupon. Twenty thousand jars. That's certainly enough for them, their family, their friends, even a few poor people. "Thank you Republican Party." Grayson came back on Nov. 18, 2010, and continued poking the GOP -- saying the money could be used to buy three tickets to the most expensive suite at the Super Bowl, to climb Mt. Everest, or for a 110-day couple's cruise around the world. ("Not just one year, but every single year," he said.) Grayson's point is that the money could be better used creating jobs than going to America's top earners. That the country could essentially take the money and hire 3 million people at $30,000 a year, creating jobs instead of lining the pockets of the rich. There's some false logic in his thinking, at least from the Republican point of view. Republicans say it's those top earners who create jobs and taking money out of their pockets will cost jobs. Grayson also certainly is guilty of hyperbole in suggesting that the rich will use the money saved from the tax cuts only on outrageous luxury items. But that's all a philosophical debate we'll let you have at your dinner tables. For PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to zero in on his baseline number, that the Republican plan for extending the 2001, 2003 and other Bush-era tax cuts would result in the top 1 percent of earners paying $83,347 a year less in taxes. Grayson said his figure comes from an analysis provided by a liberal public policy group called Citizens for Tax Justice. Citizens for Tax Justice Legislative Director Steve Wamhoff backs up Grayson's numbers, saying that if all of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of this year remain in place, the top 1 percent of earners will save $83,347 on average. But there's more to the story, Wamhoff said. First, extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone isn't exactly "the Republican plan." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a bill on Sept. 13 that would extend most of the Bush-era tax cuts, and would restore the estate tax, at some level, for some people. The effect of the McConnell bill is that the top 1 percent of income earners would see a total cut of $74,621, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Another bill filed on Nov. 17 by Republicans Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana and Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina would permanently repeal the estate tax for everyone, meaning the top 1 percent would see the cut suggested by Grayson -- $83,347, using Citizens for Tax Justice numbers. And there's a second caveat. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, want to extend some of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans too. Just not to the extent that Republicans do. While President Obama's preferred alternative is to extend the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts for only those individuals making $200,000 or less and couples making $250,000 or less, he does support extending other tax cuts that would benefit wealthier Americans, including restoring a reduced estate tax. Under Obama's plan, the top 1 percent of earners would pay $28,728 a year less in taxes than they would if all of the tax cuts were allowed to expire at the end of the year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. How does this all add up? If all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay around $83,347 a year more in federal taxes on average. If President Obama's plan is approved, the wealthiest 1 percent will pay about $54,619 a year more in federal taxes than they do now. If McConnell's bill passes, they'll pay $8,726 a year more. And if the DeMint/Pence plan passes, they'll pay the same amount. Now we know you're probably wondering if Citizens for Tax Justice's numbers are credible, especially since they define themselves as being liberal. We did, too. So we also checked with the Tax Policy Center, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. They didn't measure things exactly like Citizens for Tax Justice, but they did corroborate one critical fact. They found that if President Obama's tax plan becomes law, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans would pay $53,674 a year more, on average, in federal taxes (CTJ's number was $54,619). We also found research from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation -- a nonpartisan committee with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants -- that helps illustrate the same point, though by using slightly different criteria. The Joint Committee on Taxation found that, for those who have income of $1 million or more, extending all of the Bush tax cuts would mean $32.7 billion that the government would not collect in 2011. That amount would apply to 315,000 tax filers. Divide the foregone tax revenues by the number of filers, and you get $103,809 per tax filer. That's a bigger number than Citizens for Tax Justice, but also applies to a different pool of people. And it substantiates Grayson's broader point, which is that extending the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans means they will save a lot of money in federal taxes. In a pair of dramatic House floor speeches, he said that the Republican plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts would result in the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans saving $83,347 a year. He's quoting a study from the group Citizens for Tax Justice accurately, and the math is largely backed up by the more independent Tax Policy Center. But he neglects to mention that another GOP-embraced tax plan would shrink the tax savings of the wealthiest Americans slightly and that a significant chunk of the tax cuts he's talking about are also supported by Democrats and President Obama. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-11-30T16:40:05	2010-11-17	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06824	Says his Twitter account has 1.3 million followers.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/09/newt-gingrich/gingrich-twitter-account-has-13-million-followers/	The 2012 presidential race has thus far been filled with weighty subjects like unemployment, federal spending and America’s military interests in the Middle East. But in the Web world, one big presidential issue that surfaced recently was whether Republican candidate and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s seemingly sizable Twitter following is legit. The Gingrich campaign had to defend its candidate after the website Gawker published an article reporting that most of his 1.3 million Twitter followers are fake. Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond, in Twitter-like speed, denied the claim. "Gawker gaffed, hoodwinked their readers and insulted 1.3 million of Newt’s [Twitter followers]," Hammond told the New York Daily News. We were curious about Gingrich’s claim since he’s talked about his Twitter following to make a case that his campaign has a strong pulse. Politico reported a few weeks ago that Gingrich’s Twitter following far exceeded his Republican rivals, and even Sarah Palin, who frequently uses social media to spread her message. Gingrich, a former Georgia congressman, bragged about the Politico piece in a recent interview with the Marietta Daily Journal. "It turned out I have six times as many Twitter followers as all the other candidates combined," Gingrich told the Marietta Daily Journal. Politicians, some better than others, have been capitalizing on the social networking site where messages cannot exceed 140 characters as a faster way to engage supporters and potential voters and to weigh in on various issues. Gingrich embraced Twitter long before most political figures (he’s sent more than 2,700 tweets). Just a handful of American political figures, such as President Barack Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have more Twitter followers than Gingrich. But Gawker cited an anonymous former Gingrich staffer who estimated about 80 percent of the followers were created by agencies that are inactive or dummy accounts. But others also have picked apart Gingrich’s Twitter following. The New York-based Web search index company PeekYou said it had done its own analysis of Gingrich’s Twitter account before the Gawker article surfaced. PeekYou CEO Michael Hussey said the company concluded only 8 percent of his Twitter followers were confirmed as "real human beings." The rest, he said, didn’t have real locations, used questionable names to register their Twitter accounts and/or didn’t have any other presence online. "We noticed a lot of the stuff out there are not actual people," said Hussey, a self-proclaimed Libertarian. Hussey said the other Republican presidential candidates all had a higher percentage of Twitter followers who could be confirmed. The range was from 27 to 32 percent. Some companies will offer coupons to people to follow various social media accounts, said Amy Bruckman, an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing. Hussey pointed us to eBay, where people can pay companies to help them gather more Twitter followers (about $12.99 per 1,000). He’s dubious about many of these companies. He said their Twitter followers are often fake -- they use an illegitimate e-mail account. Hammond, the Gingrich spokesman, has strongly denied the campaign has used such tactics. With the ability of some companies to create fake accounts, does this mean that Lady Gaga, the queen of Twitter, doesn’t truly have 12.2 million followers? "She might have [some phony followers]," Hussey said. The Gingrich camp has noted that the candidate is on Twitter’s list of suggested users. Some estimates say being on that list can result in an additional 500 Twitter followers a day. Another group of researchers conducted a sample study of the Twitter followings of some of the GOP presidential candidates; Palin and Obama. The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research looked at five categories, such as the percentage of users who never tweeted and didn’t have a profile biography. In each category, Gingrich had the highest percentage of Twitter followers who didn’t have such information in each field. They found 33 percent of Gingrich followers never tweeted. Palin was second with 17 percent of followers who never tweeted. Obama was third at 10 percent. About three-quarters of Gingrich followers didn’t have a profile biography. Palin and Obama were second and third, respectively, with 54 percent and 48 percent of their followers who didn’t have a profile biography. In their defense, Obama, Gingrich and Palin have the highest supposed number of Twitter followers, so it’s logical that they have a larger percentage of suspect Twitter accounts. The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, which is part of Indiana University, said it randomly sampled 5,000 Twitter followers of each candidate. PolitiFact Georgia looked at 1,000 Gingrich Twitter followers and found 27 percent of them had no picture, had never tweeted and little to no profile information. Many others with pictures had no profile information. Some social media experts note that there are well-intentioned people who join Twitter but wind up sending few or no tweets and don’t set up a profile picture. Still, Bruckman, the Georgia Tech professor, is dubious that all of Gingrich’s Twitter followers are real. "His sheer number of followers seems out of proportion to his standing in the polls," said Bruckman, who’s been at school since 1997 and once talked with Gingrich about social networking. "Those numbers should be correlated." In response to our questions, Hammond sent us a press release that says Twitter is solely responsible for each Twitter user’s legitimacy. "We will now return to our efforts to confront the president about his inability to create jobs for the American economy. Thank you," it ended. So, does Newt Gingrich have about 1.3 million Twitter followers? Twitter still lists the candidate as having 1.3 million followers. The Gingrich camp said the Gawker article was an insult to those followers. But as we and others found, there is strong evidence that not all of these followers are real. There are Twitter followers and there are bona fide Twitter followers. Gingrich has 1.3 million of the former, not so many of the latter. We rate the campaign’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08557	Says the Feingold garage ad "is a fake: He’s not standing in front of his house."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/29/mark-belling/mark-belling-says-sen-russ-feingold-faked-his-tv-a/	In a new TV ad, U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold goes back in history, reviving images from his successful 1992 campaign when he painted promises on his garage door in Middleton. Facing a tough re-election battle, the Wisconsin Democrat tells voters he owns the same house and is still the small-town fella they elected 18 years ago -- except that today he posts promises on a website instead of his garage. It’s not exactly what you would call an attack ad. But it was enough to open the door for an attack by WISN-AM talk radio host Mark Belling. "I’m going to make an accusation here, and I am very confident that I am correct in my accusation," Belling said in the first hour of his Sept. 28, 2010 program. "That ad is a fake. That ad is a fake. Feingold is not standing in front of his house in this new ad. They faked it." Belling said he checked out the ad himself and cited an expert source he said he could not identify. "Ninety minutes of my life today was spent frame-by-framing this through the Internet to find the tipoffs that have convinced me the ad is fake," he told his listeners. "…My contention is Russ is standing in the studio." On his website, Belling posted a link to the ad with this headline: "This Feingold Ad Is A Fake: He’s Not Standing In Front of His House." While our primary focus at PolitiFact Wisconsin is fact-checking the promises, claims and accusations made by elected officials and candidates, we will also examine the words of other voices who shape the political discourse. This was a strong accusation: Did a U.S. Senate candidate aiming to show off his roots back home fake the scene from a far-off TV studio? Belling wasn’t the only person to suggest it. A political blog affiliated with the conservative National Review said it appeared that Feingold had filmed his portion of the commercial elsewhere, in front of a "green screen," and then was superimposed in front of the Middleton house. This note was picked up by National Public Radio in a weekly game show heard by some 3 million people. Both the blog and NPR withdrew their suggestions after the Feingold campaign complained it wasn’t true. We asked Belling for his evidence. "I have none," he said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Wisconsin. "It’s an accusation. They can deny it and if they're right, I'll admit it. "But it's very fishy." He went on to highlight his suspicions, including: "The bushes throw off a shadow; Feingold doesn’t"; and "His wave to the house looks fake. Why wave to a house when you’re in front of it." Also, the light is shining from the left, but Feingold’s left side "doesn’t seem lit,’’ Belling wrote. And the feet: "Why do you not see Russ's feet? It's much harder to make it appear he's standing on something than in front of it." Belling declined to name his source, other than to say he was involved in video production and shared his suspicions. "I have no proof,’’ Belling said. "I'm making an accusation that it's faked, and they can confirm or deny it." So, we asked Feingold. Was he standing in his driveway when the ad was shot? "I’m trying not to laugh," Feingold said. "Yes." After spending the night at his Middleton house, Feingold said, he attended the dedication of a war memorial in Sauk Prairie on Aug. 28 while the production crew set up in the driveway. Then he returned home to shoot the commercial. His campaign provided a still photo shot during the filming that shows Feingold in front of the house with a crew member identified as Rob Wernette, a freelance grip from Milwaukee. An employee for the WisPolitics.com website also saw the ad being filmed, with Feingold standing in his driveway. Jeff Mayers, president of WisPolitics, said one of his employees saw Feingold filming the ad in front of his home and the employee confirmed it when contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin. Feingold said plenty of folks passed by the house during the two-hour filming, some beeping and giving him a thumbs up. Feingold complained that he has received a lot of "cheap shots,’’ but that "this is the dumbest one of all time.’’ We’re not aware of any ranking of cheap shots, so we won’t weigh in on that. As for Belling’s accusation, the veteran talk show host tried to turn Feingold’s own ad against him, to suggest he’s so out of touch with state voters that he was even out of state when the ad was filmed. He said he based his assertion on his own review of the photography and on one unnamed source, who had no knowledge of how the shoot was conducted but who thought it looked fishy. As for Belling’s proof, we’ll use his own words to describe it: "I have none." And we’ll add three words of our own: Pants on Fire. (Note: On Sept. 30, 2010, Belling changed his position and said the Feingold ad was not faked).	None	Mark Belling	None	None	None	2010-09-29T14:14:07	2010-09-28	['None']
pomt-09569	"A majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-majority-americans-oppose-health-care/	In a live-blogging response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union Address, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, wrote that "a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill." We looked at recent polls to see if Boehner was correct. Using the archive at the Web site pollster.com, we found 10 relevant polls taken in January 2010 that were nonpartisan and conducted by telephone -- traditional benchmarks for highly credible polls. The exact wording of the questions varied from poll to poll, but all asked whether the respondent supports or opposes the health care plan being considered in Congress. Five out of the 10 polls found that a clear majority of respondents opposed the health care bill. From most recent to oldest, they were: • CNN: 38 percent in favor and 58 percent opposed • ABC News/Washington Post: 44 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed • Fox News: 39 percent in favor and 51 percent oppposed • Quinnipiac University: 34 percent in favor and 54 percent opposed • Another poll from CNN: 40 percent in favor and 57 percent opposed Two other polls found a sizable plurality -- but not a majority -- of respondents opposing the health care bill: • NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed • Another poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal: 33 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed One showed a tie: • Associated Press/GfK: 42 percent for each view And two showed a narrow plurality in support of the health care bill, but within the poll's margin of error: • Kaiser Family Foundation/Princeton Survey Research Associates: 42 percent in favor and 41 percent opposed • Gallup: 49 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed The Gallup poll may have attracted somewhat more support because of the question's wording, which did not refer to the specific health care bills now being considered. That poll's question was, "Would you advise your Member of Congress to vote for or against a health care bill this year, or do you not have an opinion?" But even that question could not garner a plurality of support outside the margin of error. A major factor accounting for the differences in these poll results was that some had large percentages of respondents saying they had no opinion or were uncertain, while others did not. Seven of the polls did not offer an explicit "no opinion" option when asking the question, and five of those polls led to outright majorities for opponents of the health care bill. By contrast, among the three polls that did offer a "no opinion" option, one was the Gallup poll showing a plurality in favor of the health care plan, a second was the AP poll showing a tie, and a third was the NBC poll showing 31 percent in favor and 46 percent opposed. These differences are illuminated by a separate line of questioning in the Kaiser poll. That poll demonstrated that respondents are not always sure what policies are actually included in the health care proposal. When presented with a list of policy provisions, 8 percent to 25 percent of respondents, depending on the provision, said they were not sure if the idea was included in the proposal or not. "Even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate," Kaiser concluded. The foundation added that "awareness can matter. Among the least known elements of the bills, those with the biggest potential to change minds include the fact that the Congressional Budget Office has said health reform would reduce the deficit (only 15% expect the legislation to reduce the deficit, but 56% said hearing that makes them more supportive) and that the legislation would stop insurers from charging women more than men (37% are aware that the legislation would do this, but 50% said this provision makes them more supportive)." So, Boehner would have been on firm ground if he'd said that more Americans oppose the health care bill than support it. Instead, he said "a majority of Americans still oppose this health care bill," something that was strictly true in only half the January polls we looked at. That said, Boehner is not far off. In none of the 10 polls we looked at did supporters outnumber opponents by an amount larger than the margin of error. So we'll knock down the minority leader for his imprecise language and rate his statement Mostly True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-01-28T13:58:23	2010-01-27	['United_States']

pomt-05919	Says the U.S. federal income tax rate was 0 percent until 1913.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-federal-income-tax-rate-was-0-percen/	Asked at a recent Republican presidential debate to specify what the highest federal income tax rate should be, the candidates offered various figures: 15 percent from Newt Gingrich, 20 percent from Rick Perry, 25 percent from Mitt Romney, and 28 percent from Rick Santorum. When it was Ron Paul’s turn to respond, the Texas congressman undercut the previous answers, saying: "We should have the lowest tax that we’ve ever had, and up until 1913, it was 0 percent. What’s so bad about that?" It’s no secret that Paul favors smaller government and less taxation. His campaign website says that as president, he would support a constitutional amendment to abolish the income tax. If that can’t be done, however, the web page says, another way to bring the income tax rate to 0 percent would be to restrain federal spending "by enforcing the Constitution’s strict limits on the federal government’s power." PolitiFact has delved into the history of the federal income tax for previous fact-checks, and PolitiFact Texas explored its origins in December 2010 after Perry linked Woodrow Wilson, the Progressive movement and the income tax while promoting his book Fed Up! That look noted Americans first paid an income tax 50 years before Wilson’s presidency, after Congress approved one in 1861 to help cover the expenses of the Civil War; it expired in 1872. So, is it accurate to say Americans paid a zero income tax rate until 1913? Let’s review the history. First of all, Paul had a reason for mentioning 1913; the 16th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified that year, legalizing a federal income tax, and Congress approved legislation enacting one. The 1913 law imposed a tax of 1 percent on income up to $20,000, for both individual and joint filers. However, exemptions from the tax — the first $3,000 of income for individuals and the first $4,000 for joint filers — meant "virtually all middle-class Americans" were excused from paying, according to W. Elliot Brownlee’s book, Federal Taxation in America. The law also put in place a graduated surtax on incomes above $20,000; the highest rate paid, 7 percent, applied to Americans making more than $500,000 (about $11.4 million in 2011 dollars). The amendment’s ratification came nearly two decades after the U.S. Supreme Court in 1895 voided an income tax that Congress had approved a year earlier. That tax never took effect. The court declared the tax unconstitutional because it was not apportioned according to the population of each state, as the Constitution then required. That meant, for example, that if 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in Virginia, no more than 5 percent of the tax’s total revenue could come from Virginia. The 16th Amendment removed this barrier by authorizing Congress to collect taxes on incomes "without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration." To gauge how the income tax worked in its first incarnation, we consulted sources detailing the Civil War-era levy — including two history books and the Tax History Museum website, a project of the nonprofit group Tax Analysts, based in Falls Church, Va. The sources don’t concur on every detail, but how the tax came to be comes clear. Congress enacted the nation’s first federal income tax in 1861, setting a flat rate of 3 percent on incomes higher than $800. Over the next four years, Congress expanded the tax as members cut the amount of income that could be exempted and introduced higher, graduated rates. By 1865, the last year of the Civil War, the highest income tax rate, 10 percent, was applied to income in excess of $5,000, according to Roy and Gladys Blakey’s 1940 book, The Federal Income Tax. According to Brownlee’s book, more than 10 percent of Union households were paying the income tax at the end of the war. With hostilities over, however, Congress was eager to reduce the tax burden, so it began raising the tax’s income exemption level and lowering the rate. By 1870, the exemption level had been increased to $2,000 and the rate reduced to 2.5 percent. According to the Blakeys’ book, the lawmakers of the Civil War era intended the income tax to be a temporary wartime tool. At least four of the income tax measures enacted during the war and soon after contained a provision saying that the law was to be in force until 1870 and "no longer," the Blakeys wrote. Ultimately, Congress voted to let the income tax expire in 1872. We checked in with Joseph Thorndike, director of Tax Analysts’ Tax History Project, who told us that he thought Paul’s statement at the debate was fair. Pointing to the temporary nature of the wartime tax and the four decades that the United States went without an income tax before 1913, Thorndike said his view is that the Civil War-era tax should be a "relatively small caveat" to the statement that there was no federal income tax until 1913. Our ruling Paul’s statement that the federal income tax rate was zero until 1913 reflects the timing of the constitutional change enabling the current tax. But his claim disregards two pre-1913 efforts to impose an income tax — one of which was in place for a decade. This debate claim rates Half True.

pomt-11477	Says Keanu Reeves said, "For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/05/blog-posting/no-keanu-reeves-did-not-call-donald-trump-role-mod/	An online hoax purports to quote actor Keanu Reeves expressing full-throated support for President Donald Trump. The item appears on the website supporttrumppresidency.blogspot.com, and contains a banner headline that reads: "For me, Trump is the symbol of a successful man and a role model for every young American, something that our nation was looking for for year. I don’t think that America will again have a leader like him." But neither the text contained in the body of the article, nor a video embedded in the post, supports the emphatic headline. The body of the article is entirely unrelated to politics. It tells an anecdote of Reeves' experience on set during the shooting of the 1994 action film Speed, co-starring Sandra Bullock. The video at the end of the post shows an interview Reeves did with a journalist in Uruguay, in which he discussed his early career and current film projects. Neither the text nor the video mentions politics, much less the actor's views on Trump. In fact, the only instance we found of Reeves discussing Trump publicly is when he appeared to criticize the president’s travel ban during a January 2017 question-and-answer with journalists at a red carpet event. Reeves told a journalist he believed the travel ban was "just terrible," according to a Jan. 31, 2017, Associated Press article. The only other references we found to Reeves' putative support for Trump were from other dubious websites that repeated the same baseless quote. Reeves' publicist confirmed the quote is fake. "It is completely false," said Cheryl Maisel, of talent agency PMK-BNC. "He never made those comments nor did he ever do that interview. All manufactured." This is not the first time Reeves has been the subject of a fake quote. We previously checked a lengthy cultural critique misattributed to Reeves, which we rated Pants on Fire. Our ruling Bloggers said Reeves described Trump as the symbol of success and a role model for young Americans. We found no evidence he actually said these words. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-06752	The 2009-11 state budget that Democrats approved left Wisconsin taxpayers $3.6 billion in debt.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/24/jonathan-steitz/republican-candidate-jonathan-steitz-says-democrat/	Gov. Scott Walker signed the 2011-13 state budget in June. But that didn’t stop the spending plan from playing a prominent role in the state Senate recall campaigns in August. Republicans worked to paint their Democratic opponents -- the members of the Assembly running against GOP senators and Democratic senators defending their seats -- as reckless spenders who left a mess to be cleaned up. The refrain was that the Democratic lawmakers, along with former Gov. Jim Doyle, are to blame for the state being bankrupt or broke. There were many variations of it, but one seemed worth visiting even though the recall elections are over. Why? Some claims have a way of being recycled for future campaigns. The one we are looking at came in a radio ad by Republican Jonathan Steitz, who lost his bid to unseat Sen. Robert Wirch (D-Pleasant Prairie) in the Aug. 16, 2011 recall election The ad said: "Wirch voted to raise job-killing taxes by $4.7 billion, and voted for $3.6 billion in out-of-control reckless government spending ... and after all those taxes and all that spending ... Wirch left us with three billion in debt... only to flee to Illinois instead of staying to get the job done." Call it the $3.6 billion question. Or, in this case, $3.6 billion accusation. We previously rated False a statement by state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) that Walker’s estimate of the budget deficit was a "bogus figure." We also found Doyle’s late 2010 estimate of the size of the deficit was False, in part because it included many assumptions about what Walker might do. And we found Walker’s statement that the state was "broke" to be False. (We’ve also ruled on several statements about the "structural deficit" -- an entirely different matter.) See what we mean about themes coming up again and again? So, back to the claim: Did Democrats under Doyle approve a budget that left the state in debt? Not a deficit. Debt. The short answer is no. That’s not how the budget process works, said Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The state constitution requires lawmakers approve a budget that’s balanced, and the budget that was passed for 2009-11 was no exception. The $3.6 billion figure came about when the state budget office looked at the 2009-2011 budget, as plans were being readied for the next one (the 2011-13 budget). The report considers tax revenue projections and what agencies plan to spend in the next budget, and came up with what Lang termed a "shortfall." To be sure, the calculation depended on which party is running the budget office. In November 2010, the outgoing Doyle administration said the shortfall was $1.5 billion, which was far lower than the $2.7 billion figure used by candidates during the campaign for governor. In February 2011, Walker’s Department of Administration ran its own version of the numbers and concluded that the shortfall was $3.6 billion. So what does that number represent? "It’s a challenge," Lang said of the figure. "The challenge for the 2011-13 budget was $3.6 billion." In other words, that was the amount -- through a combination of spending cuts, tax increases or other measures -- that the state budget would have to be adjusted to account for all of the department budget requests and the projected tax revenue. One thing is clear: The $3.6 billion was not a debt, as Steitz claimed. Debt is something that is owed, typically over the long term. Borrowed money, for instance. The state did not borrow, bond or otherwise owe money to anyone because of the $3.6 billion. Other steps -- some very controversial politically -- were taken to address the gap. Lang put it this way: "We did not have a deficit, nor were we in debt." Lang noted that the shorthand for the shortfall, including in Journal Sentinel news accounts, was a "deficit" -- but rarely, if ever, a debt. That brings us to the bottom line: Steitz claimed that the 2009-2011 budget approved by Democrats created a $3.6 billion debt for Walker and the new Republican Legislature. Under the state constitution, the state budget has to be balanced. While some phrased the shortfall for the next two-year budget as a deficit, it certainly was not a debt. That comes with borrowed money that must be repaid. We rate the statement False.	None	Jonathan Steitz	None	None	None	2011-08-24T09:00:00	2011-08-03	['Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03871	On raising taxes.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-does-full-flop-not-raising-taxes/	For better or worse, Gov. Bob McDonnell will be remembered for helping convince the General Assembly this winter to pass Virginia’s first major package of new transportation funding in 27 years. Supporters say the legislation -- which will eventually raise at least $880 million a year, mostly from new taxes and fees -- will pay for road building and maintenance projects that are vital to Virginia’s economy and quality of life. McDonnell heralded its passage on Feb. 23 as "a historic day in Virginia." But a group of conservatives still hoping to stop the plan is accusing McDonnell of breaking a 2009 campaign commitment to not raise taxes. The opponents include bloggers at Americans for Tax Reform, Bearing Drift, and Jamie Radtke, a Virginia tea party organizer who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate last year. Radtke has started a Facebook page, urging the governor to veto the plan he says he supports. She has written an online editorial accusing McDonnell of flip-flopping on taxes. "It is important to juxtapose Gov. McDonnell’s support of this massive tax increase with his rhetoric of the past," she wrote. Has McDonnell changed his position on increasing taxes for roads? We decided to submit the question to our Flip-O-Meter. Let’s start by traveling back to the 2009 campaign. McDonnell -- despite coaxing from Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform -- did not sign a pledge to oppose all tax increases. But he made it clear that he rejected raising levies. That July, he issued a transportation plan that criticized then-Gov. Tim Kaine’s administration of "being so wedded to funding new transportation investments solely through new taxes that it has dragged its feet on several viable alternatives." McDonnell proposed raising money for roads without increasing taxes by privatizing the state’s liquor stores and issuing bonds. He also wanted to dedicate to transportation a portion of annual revenue growth and budget surpluses, and all money that would come to the state if the White House allowed drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast. Critics said McDonnell’s created a few windfalls for transportation but failed to tap a reliable new stream of funding to build and maintain roads over the long run. That August, the Associated Press interviewed McDonnell for an hour and quoted him as saying, "Any general increase in the taxes of Virginia I’m not going to support. I’m not planning to raise taxes. That’s the best I can tell you." On Sept. 11, 2009 -- as Radtke notes on her website -- McDonnell was interviewed on WTOP radio in Washington. "So, no tax will be raised during your four-year term?" the host, Mark Plotkin, asked. "I’m going to be able to find other ways to fund transportation," McDonnell replied. Two newspapers reported that McDonnell pledged not to raise taxes during a Sept. 17, 2009, debate against his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Creigh Deeds of Bath County. "McDonnell said he would not raise taxes as governor," said an article the next day in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "After the debate, he said he would not sign a transportation bill submitted to him by the legislature if it included any tax increase." The Roanoke Times reported, "McDonnell insisted he would not raise taxes." McDonnell emphasized that message by launching a TV commercial on Oct. 2 in which he spoke of the need to improve roads. "My plan: New money for transportation, while protecting education and not raising taxes," he said. Four days later, McDonnell aired another TV ad assailing Deeds for supporting a gas tax increase to pay for roads. "Creigh Deeds has unequivocally committed himself to higher taxes," the announcer said. "...His $1 billion tax increase would add 20 cents to a gallon of gas." Now, let’s return to 2013. On. Jan. 9, McDonnell proposed a plan to raise $640 million a year for transportation. He called for eliminating the 17.5-cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasoline and increasing the state’s 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The governor also wanted to raise the motor vehicle registration fee and create a fee for alternative fuel vehicles. The proposal was extensively amended by the General Assembly. On Feb. 23, lawmakers passed a bipartisan deal that would raise $880 million a year -- about $680 million of which would come from tax increases. The legislation would replace the per-gallon excise levy with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level, raise the state sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle sales tax to 4.3 percent. In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise $558 million a year for transportation. McDonnell has yet to sign the bill. But he has expressed his strong support, saying the legislation "fixed the problem" of sufficiently funding transportation and thanking lawmakers who voted for it. What explains the governor’s change of heart? Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications, said transportation problems were worsening and McDonnell ran out of options, short of general tax increases, to fix them. Martin noted in an email that two of McDonnell’s proposals to raise money for roads failed: the General Assembly had no desire to sell state liquor stores and the White House did not approve offshore drilling in Virginia. Martin mentioned other steps McDonnell took to spur road building prior to this year. The governor audited the Virginia Department of Transportation and found $1 billion in unspent money about about $400 million in efficiencies that were redirected to road projects. Virginia has issued more than $1.7 billion in transportation bonds since McDonnell took office. The state is selling sponsorships and naming rights for roads. "None of those actions were enough," Martin wrote. He noted that a 2012 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University found that the Northern Virginia-Washington region has the worst traffic congestion in the nation. Hampton Roads was ranked the 20th worst. Martin said the governor became increasingly concerned that the congestion "was negatively impacting Virginia’s economic competitiveness." McDonnell’s aversion to tax increases, Martin wrote, took a backseat to another campaign pledge. "The governor’s foremost campaign promise was to do everything in his power to help the private sector create good-paying jobs for our citizens," he said. "...Virginians won’t find good jobs without a 21st century transportation system that will help job creators." We should note that the last two Virginia governors to sign major tax increases, Democrats Gerald Baliles in 1986 and Mark Warner in 2004, promised during their campaigns that they would not increase levies. The record shows McDonnell, too, changed his position on not raising taxes. Some may applaud him for bold leadership, others may criticize him for breaking faith. We won’t enter that debate. Our goal is to document his record and, in this instance, he did a Full Flop.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2013-03-08T13:58:38	2013-03-08	['None']
pomt-13022	Latina who enthusiastically supported Donald Trump on stage in Las Vegas in October 2015 has been deported.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/05/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-claim-famed-latina-trump-supporter/	Donald Trump alienated a share of immigrant voters during his presidential campaign after making controversial remarks about Mexicans, but that didn’t deter a Hispanic woman from eagerly showing her support for him during a campaign rally. "I am Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump! We vote for Mr. Trump! Yes, Mr. Trump! We love you, we love you all the way to the White House!" Myriam Witcher said enthusiastically into a microphone, flailing her arms up in the air while gripping an American flag and a People magazine with Trump on the cover. Witcher, an immigrant from Colombia, garnered attention for her lavish praises during the October 2015 rally in Las Vegas, particularly because Trump had presented a hard-line immigration stance, including talk of mass deportation. Soon after her on-stage appearance, rumors spread that Witcher had been deported. A PolitiFact Texas reader recently emailed us saying reports of her deportation were being shared widely, including on Facebook. We wondered, where’s Witcher? Still on U.S. soil, Witcher told PolitiFact. Rumors of her deportation started last year despite being a naturalized U.S. citizen, Witcher said via a phone interview. Though she lives in Las Vegas, Witcher on Nov. 30 said she was in New York. According to the rumors, "up to this day, I’m still deported," Witcher said. "I don’t waste my time with that." Satirical post and other sites On Oct. 9, 2015, the day after Witcher appeared next to Trump, a Spanish-language satirical website based in Colombia posted an article headlined, "They deport Colombian who declared her love to Trump." Actualidad Panamericana’s 257-word satirical post said Witcher’s return to Colombia was expected after a quick deportation order from immigration authorities. The piece said Witcher’s immigration papers showed "serious inconsistencies" and that her real name was "Miriam Encanto" -- a spelling variation of her first name and a word for her last name that in English means "charm." The post says that Witcher was picked up by immigration authorities while having dinner with Trump, and that enforcement officials showed up after receiving a call from a "patriot with a toupee." An Actualidad Panamericana editor said they believe rumors of Witcher’s deportation surged from their post. On its website, Actualidad Panamericana says its goal is to entertain and that all its content is fiction and does not correspond with reality. Talks of Witcher’s deportation are also posted on another Spanish-language website, Coyotitos.com, a site that lacks information detailing who’s behind it and the mission. The article on Witcher and other posts don’t have publication dates or bylines indicating who wrote them. Their Facebook page says they are a media/news company, but they did not return a message requesting more information. Coyotitos’ post about Witcher is headlined, "Hispanic woman who supported Donald Trump has been deported by the Department of Migration." (There is no such department.) The article says different media outlets have started to report what happened to Witcher, "who has been deported for not having legal ‘immigration status.’" The post warns the information has not been officially confirmed despite being widespread and that it should be taken with caution. Media interviews Anthony Avellaneda, a journalist for El Tiempo, a Hispanic publication of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said he has occasionally interviewed Witcher. He quoted her in an article posted Sept. 9, 2016. "She’s still here in Las Vegas. She has not been deported," Avellaneda said, adding that news of her removal stemmed from satirical posts. Witcher also was featured in a video published Nov. 1 by a German publication, Spiegel Online. Witcher appears standing outside the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas and reaffirms her admiration for Trump. Witcher says she’s a citizen and sports a Trump campaign pin on her blazer as well as a "Vote Early Today" sticker. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an online search page to locate detainees who are in custody or who have been released within the last 60 days. There’s no result for Myriam Witcher. (We checked the database for other variations of her name, too.) An Oct. 9, 2015, article by the Las Vegas Sun about Witcher’s encounter with Trump reported that Witcher said she "had to wait five years to earn legal status in the U.S." Witcher published a book in May about Trump that includes information about her immigration status. "After immigrating to the United States and becoming a U.S. citizen, she has developed a deep appreciation for our country, and believes with all her heart that Mr. Trump will put America first and make our country great again. She is married to a native U.S. citizen from Texas, who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service," reads Witcher’s book author description. Witcher campaigned for Trump, posting dozens of videos on her YouTube channel recapping his immigration plan and encouraging viewers to vote for him. Gail J. Anderson, a deputy secretary within the Nevada Secretary of State office, said a Myriam Witcher born in 1960 and a registered voter in Clark County voted in this year’s general election. Our ruling News has spread on social media saying Myriam Witcher, a Trump supporter who made headlines for effusively showing her admiration for him during a rally, has been deported. In a phone interview, Witcher said she’s a U.S. citizen who has not been deported and is still a Trump supporter. In 2015, a Colombian website wrote a satirical piece a day after Witcher appeared with Trump on TV. The post said Witcher had been ordered deported and would be returning to Colombia within days. Journalists have interviewed Witcher on U.S. soil in the past few months. An online search tool for immigration detainees shows no result for Witcher.

pomt-13754	The U.S. has to go to "plane graveyards" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-military-jets-need-salvage-par/	"Trump Force One," as Donald Trump’s Boeing 757 has been nicknamed, has drawn attention for years. A 2011 tour of the renovated jet, posted on Trump’s YouTube channel, has been viewed more than 8 million times. Its 24-karat gold-plated seat belts have been catalogued by the New York Times and the Washington Post. But does Trump know his stuff when it comes to the state of U.S. military aviation? At a June 16, 2016 stop in Dallas during a Trump fundraising swing through Texas, he ripped into U.S. reliance on outdated aircraft while selling newer technology to allies, telling the crowd: "Remember, we’re the ones with the jet fighters that are 20 years old that we have to go to graveyards, plane graveyards, to get parts to use on our jet fighters, to have our great young people to fly in planes where they go into junk yards and museums to get parts for current fighters, while our opponents and our so-called allies are buying our planes, and they’ve got the new beautiful versions of them, and we’ve got old planes, I mean literally obsolete planes. It’s not going to happen anymore, folks, ok?" The comments made us wonder — is the U.S. military really scrounging for parts in junkyards and museums? Are our jets really decades old? And do we sell newer and better planes to our allies while keeping older, inferior versions for ourselves? The Trump campaign did not return a request for backup for Trump’s claim, and the Air Force did not respond to repeated requests for comment, so we did some searching and asked a few third-party experts for information on Trump’s points. As it turns out, it’s true that some of U.S. military planes are 20 years old — and some are much older. Contacted by email, Carl Rhodes, director of Force Modernization and Employment Program at RAND Project AIR FORCE, a federally funded research and development center that provides analytical support to the Air Force, told us "some are over 60 years old like the B-52" while "others are brand new, like the F-22 and F-35." At a Feb. 9, 2016, news conference, Major General James F. Martin Jr., the Air Force deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the average age of its aircraft is over 27. The Air Force Posture Statement for fiscal year 2017, released on February 10, 2016, states that makes the current fleet the oldest ever: "While our Airmen remain heavily engaged around the world, the average age of our aircraft is at an all-time high, and the size of our force and state of our full-spectrum readiness are at or near all-time lows." So, Trump has a point about the U.S. Air Force relying on older planes. To our inquiry, Rhodes also confirmed that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes, directing us to a Jan. 30, 2013 news feature story in AIRMAN, published by the Air Force Office of Public Affairs. According to the story, reclamation teams with the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group save time and money by pulling parts that are still functional from shelved planes, sparing the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. According to a fact sheet we spotted on the Air Force’s website, since 1964, U.S. military aircraft have been stored and disposed of by Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Davis-Monthan was first established as an aircraft storage facility following World War II. According to a February 4, 2003 PBS story, the practice of removing parts from the junked planes dates to the 1950s. So, must the government go to "graveyards" to get parts? "Probably not," Rhodes told us, "but it can save quite a bit of money versus buying all new parts and keeping a sufficient stockpile." How much money, exactly? Col. Robert Lepper, Commander of the 309th AMARG, told an Arizona news service in 2014 that the group returns about a half billion dollars worth of parts into service each year. Rhodes also offered an example that supports Trump’s claim that in some cases, the U.S. sells planes more advanced than the ones they themselves are using. "We are selling F-16s to the UAE which are more advanced than our USAF F-16s," he said. Rhodes pointed us to a January 2014 news post on Defense Industry Daily, a trade publication focused on defense acquisition, stating the United Arab Emirates invested $3 billion in research to develop the planes, which are made by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin, the number one US government contractor overall and within the Air Force sub-sector in fiscal year 2015, reported about 20% of their annual sales revenue came from sales to foreign entities, according to their SEC filings from 2010. Their filings report aircraft sales to countries including Israel, Kuwait, South Korea, and Tunisia. Over 25 countries purchased Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Fighting Falcon, and 15 have purchased the C-130J Super Hercules. Boeing is the number two Air Space contractor. Some 62% of Boeing’s Defense, Space and Security Revenue comes from the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the company’s 2015 annual report. International customers account for "roughly one-third of revenue and 40 percent of current backlog" for the company. International sales account for a much smaller portion of the sales of the number three company, Northrop Grumman, according to their annual report -- 14 percent of the $23.5 billion total. The U.S. government’s own Defense Security Cooperation Agency’s web site acknowledges an uptick in foreign demand, noting in a 2014 publication, "While the United States and European Union are cutting their defense expenditures, several countries — particularly in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America — are increasing expenditures. Hence, U.S. Contractors are increasingly seeking to sell products and services to these markets." But experts we spoke to said that selling planes to other nations isn’t relevant to the state of our own military aviation. Todd Harrison, director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, commented by email: "The fact that U.S. companies are selling planes to other countries is not relevant. Those same companies are also selling planes to the U.S. military right now, and in many cases the U.S. is getting significantly better aircraft than our allies and partners. And what would the alternative be — block U.S. companies from selling aircraft to others? Then our allies and partners would be less capable and even more dependent on us for security, putting an even greater strain on our forces." Obaid Younossi, director of resource management at RAND Project AIR FORCE, agreed by email that foreign military sales are a plus for the U.S. "We still make and keep the best of best for us: F-22, F-35, KC-46, F/A-18E/F, E-2D, and P-8. There are certainly versions of F-35 and F-18E/F we sell to our allies, but the vast majority of what is coming out of production is for our Services," Younossi wrote. "FMS [Foreign Military Sales] is good not only for strategic reasons but also for economic reasons. It keeps costs down for us, keeps our industrial base in business, and helps pay for development of technology (i.e. F-16 Block 60 and Kuwaiti investments)," Younossi said. "Do we need to worry about modernization?," Younossi wrote, adding: "Yes but not for reasons cited. Some of the old work horses can still do the job but we need new ones to counter future threats." In October 2015, the Pentagon awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman Corp. to build the first new bombers since the Cold War, which are to be deployed in the 2020s. Since Trump assured his audience "it’s not going to happen anymore, folks," it’s worth noting that updating the military’s aging fleet isn’t the kind of job that can be done overnight — nor is it fully within the hands of the executive branch, as funding levels, determined by Congress, have contributed to readiness problems. according to Air Force officials like Chief of Staff Mark Welsh and Secretary Deborah Lee James.. Our ruling While in Texas, Trump said the U.S. has to go to "plane graveyards" and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries. The government indeed salvages parts for military planes remaining in action and the U.S. also sells aircraft to militaries abroad. But clarification is needed. The described parts salvaging, which can save time and money, doesn’t appear to be misguided and the U.S. also buys new planes for its forces. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08514	Marco Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age," and "cut benefits."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/charlie-crist/fact-checking-marco-rubios-social-security-stance/	Charlie Crist's latest attack ad targets Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and hits on a touchy subject for elderly Floridians: Social Security. The 30-second ad aims to sway votes in a key demographic. Florida's 60 and older population makes up more than 30 percent of registered voters, and more than 40 percent voters who cast ballots in 2006. The ad, released Oct. 5, 2010, is called "Protect." Here's a transcript: Work longer, get by on less. That’s the Marco Rubio retirement plan. Rubio wants to raise the Social Security retirement age. That means you’ll work harder and longer for your money. And Rubio wants to cut benefits, though it’s already tough enough to make ends meet. That’s Washington for you – balance the budget on the backs of seniors. There’s a better choice. Charlie Crist is against raising the retirement age. He'll protect Social Security because our seniors have earned it. The claim that we're checking is that Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age" and "cut benefits." The Rubio campaign was ready and waiting for the Crist attack. The campaign issued a press release criticizing the ad at 10:32 a.m. on Oct. 5, 13 minutes before the Crist campaign sent out its press release announcing the ad (Apparently, the ad was posted earlier in the morning on the website YouTube). "In his latest desperate attempt to say and do anything to win an election, Charlie Crist has launched a desperate false attack ad designed solely to mislead Florida voters and scare seniors about Marco Rubio's Social Security position," the press release starts. "The ad falsely claims that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits to 'balance the budget on the backs of seniors.' This claim is demonstrably false." Within 30 minutes of Crist's announcement about the new ad, conservative commentator Stephen F. Hayes had penned almost 700 words about the Crist ad in a blog post titled, "A Desperate Charlie Crist Dishonestly Attacks Rubio," that regurgitates Rubio's talking points. And within three hours the world heard from former Gov. Jeb Bush. "Charlie Crist should be ashamed of his false attack against Marco Rubio on Social Security. Charlie Crist is purposely trying to scare seniors in order to win votes," Bush said. "The fact is, Marco Rubio will protect Social Security. His own mother relies on Social Security and he has repeatedly stated that he would not support or propose any benefit reductions for current retirees or people who are close to retirement." Thanks for the input spin, guys, but we'll handle the fact-checking, okay? More than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits, according to the U.S. Social Security Administration. To be eligible to receive full benefits, a person must be between 65 and 67 (depending on what year they were born), be disabled, be a survivor of a worker who died, or be a dependent of Social Security beneficiaries. Social Security was a New Deal program created in 1935 to help elderly and other Americans with economic hardships. The program is funded by payroll taxes. This year, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084. So something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent. Rubio on the retirement age Rubio has suggested that one solution is to gradually raise the retirement age. Speaking to reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 27, 2010, Rubio said the "retirement age issue is going to have to be confronted at some point as part of a measure to reform Social Security." Rubio talked about raising the retirement age in a Wall Street Journal interview published March 13, 2010. "I know . . . people don't like to talk about it," the article quotes Rubio as saying. "Privatization of the accounts has come and gone, (but) there are other alternatives, such as [raising] the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, 'need' measures, et cetera." And then the retirement age came up again during a March 28 Fox News Sunday debate with a then-Republican Crist. Host Chris Wallace asked Rubio if he would raise the retirement age. "I think that has to be on the table. That's got to be part of the solution. The retirement age that gradually increases for people of my generation, I think has got to be part of ...," Rubio says before getting cut off. He has reiterated that position throughout the campaign, with one important caveat -- there would be no changes for people nearing or now retired. "I think if you're 55 years of age or older or close enough to retirement ... I think this is off the table," Rubio said in the Fox interview. In the Wall Street Journal interview, he said any retirement age changes wouldn't affect people within 10 years of retirement. Rubio on benefit cuts Rubio also suggested changes in the cost-of-living adjustments Social Security beneficiaries receive. In the March Fox News debate, Rubio was asked if he would change cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. "I think all of that has to be on the table, including the way we index increases in cost of living. All of these issues have to be on the table," Rubio said. "They have to be options that I would be open to." Rubio said as much again on Sept. 26, 2010, in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. "Younger workers like myself, people 39 years of age like I am -- we're going to have to accept that there's going to be some changes to Social Security," Rubio said. "And perhaps they're going to have to change the way the benefit is indexed. Perhaps we're going to have to continue to allow the retirement age to fluctuate, as it has been doing since the early 1980s. "But again, that's for younger workers like myself who have 20 or 30 years to prepare for this. People that are on the system now, or let's say 10 years from retirement or 12 years from retirement, these folks can't all of a sudden make a change to adjust for it. So I think we have to start talking honestly about the long-term challenges facing a very important program, Social Security, because we want to save it. It's important. We want to preserve it." That full quote probably best explains Rubio's position, in his own words. He supports what amounts to benefit cuts and raising the retirement age, in order to keep Social Security solvent, but not for current retirees or folks nearing retirement. His point is that without changes, Social Security won't be able to meet its obligations. And on that point he's right (not that Crist is going to admit it). Rubio's stance has won him praise from the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, which said his position included "the sorts of straight answers Floridians deserve from serious candidates," and conservative commentator George Will, who said, "Rubio's responsible answer to a serious question gives the nation a glimpse of a rarity -- a brave approach to the welfare state's inevitable politics of gerontocracy." What the Rubio folks are all bothered about Crist's ad claims that Rubio "wants to raise the Social Security retirement age" and "cut benefits." Rubio, in his own words, says as much. So what has the Rubio campaign all angry? First, the ad fails to mention the caveat in Rubio's thinking -- that any adjustments to Social Security, whether to the retirement age or benefits, would not affect either current retirees or people nearing retirement. That, and the images that go with the ad. The ad includes images of white-haired and wrinkled-faced retirees that goes along with the narrator's script. When the ad cuts to Charlie Crist, it shows him talking and shaking hands with seniors. "Crist knows that Rubio has pledged to protect and preserve Social Security for those who are at or near retirement," Rubio's campaign said in their press release. Crist spokesman Danny Kanner responded: "In an ad about Social Security, I don't think it's irrelevant to include images of senior citizens." We should note that the ad also says that Rubio wants to "balance the budget on the backs of seniors." That's not true. The changes to Social Security Rubio supports are to make the Social Security program solvent long term, not to create extra tax revenues to use to balance the budget, fund other federal programs or to pay down the federal debt. Crist's ad, "Protect" is correct in pointing out that Rubio supports proposals to keep Social Security solvent past 2037 by raising the retirement age and potentially reducing benefits. Rubio says changes are necessary or the Social Security program will go broke, a sentiment shared by the trustees who manage the federal program. But the ad fails to mention that Rubio's proposals would not affect any current retirees, or people nearing retirement (Rubio most often has said people within 10 years of reaching the Social Security retirement age). The ad certainly doesn't convey that half of the story. So, we think it's appropriate to rate this claim Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-10-06T17:41:24	2010-10-05	['Marco_Rubio']

pomt-06334	"The unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America. It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/09/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-unemployment-college-grads-4-5-/	During a Republican presidential debate in Michigan on Nov. 9, 2011, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania drew a striking contrast between the unemployment rates for Americans with bachelor’s degrees and those without. "The unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America," he said. "It's 4 percent or 5 percent for people who have college degrees." To check this, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment statistics. (One technical note for economic geeks -- we’re using the 25-and-over age group for our data rather than the 16-and-over age group used to calculate the familiar national unemployment rate. That’s because BLS data doesn’t provide educational attainment breakdowns for age brackets below 25.) Let’s look at the rate for college graduates first, since it’s more readily accessible. In October 2011, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 25 years and older who had at least a bachelor’s degree was 4.4 percent. That rate was not unusual: In the 32 months since March 2008, the unemployment rate for college-educated Americans has remained within a fairly narrow band, between 4.3 percent and 5.1 percent. So on that claim, Santorum’s on the mark. Judging the other part of his claim -- that "the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits" -- is trickier, because it depends on your definition of "non-college-educated." We see at least two plausible definitions -- those who have only a high school degree and never attended college at all, and those who attended college but did not earn a degree. Of these two categories, the data for the first is easier to provide, since BLS offers that information directly. The seaonally adjusted unemployment rate for high school graduates without any college experience and who are 25 years and older was 9.6 percent in October. The highest that number climbed since the onset of the most recent recession was 11.2 percent, in October 2009. Shifting to those who graduated high school and attended college but did not graduate, the numbers have to be extrapolated. So we did that and found that for this group, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in October 2011. In other words, not only are both measures virtually identical, but they are also not -- as Santorum said -- "well into the double digits." Nor, during the period we looked at, were they ever well into the double digits for Americans with a high school diploma. To find an unemployment rate for 25-and-overs that can be described as "well into the double digits," you have to get an even less-well-educated pool -- those without a high school degree. For high school dropouts 25 and over, the unemployment rate was 13.8 percent in October 2011. Our ruling Santorum was correct when he said that the unemployment rate is 4 percent or 5 percent for college graduates; it’s currently 4.4 percent. But he overstated his case when he said that "the unemployment rate among (the) non-college-educated is well into the double digits in America." While relatively high by historical standards, the actual numbers today are not in the double digits, much less well into them. On balance, we rate Santorum’s statement Half True. UPDATE: After this item appeared, a number of readers asked us to clarify the unemployment rates for people at various educational achievement levels, so we'll provide more detail here. If you take all people except those with a bachelor's degree -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts, those with only a high school diploma, those with some college but no bachelor's degree, and those with an associate's degree -- the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent. Alternately, if you take people without any college experience -- that is, the sum of high school dropouts and those with only a high school diploma -- the unemployment rate was 10.6 percent. Since neither group was "well into the double digits," as Santorum said, we see no reason to change our ruling.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2011-11-09T23:07:10	2011-11-09	['United_States']

pomt-04432	"By voting to approve [Question 1], we can . . . save 900 jobs" at Twin River.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/14/coalition-bring-jobs-ri/twin-river-linked-organization-says-approval-table/	Once again, the state's two slot parlors are rolling the dice in hopes that Rhode Islanders -- along with residents of Lincoln and Newport, where the facilities are located -- will approve referenda permitting the table games that will make them full-fledged casinos. While recent polls show support for the measure, it's anything but a sure bet, and the businesses are spending millions to win support for the measure. One commercial in support of Question 1 is sponsored by Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., a 501(c)4 nonprofit "social welfare" organization created by officials at Twin River, in Lincoln, the larger of the two facilities. It features an East Providence woman who talks about the problems of the Rhode Island economy and tells viewers: "By voting to approve, we can keep revenue right here, save 900 jobs and help create 650 new ones." The ad makes no mention of the Newport facility, Newport Grand. We were interested in checking whether defeat of Question 1 would really result in the loss of 900 existing jobs at Twin River. (A comparable proposal, Question 2, would allow table games at Newport Grand.) Twin River and Newport Grand want to add table games to remain competitive with the three casinos and one "racino" expected to be created in Massachusetts in the next several years. The fear is that, without the table games, customers will flock to the Bay State instead. The stakes are huge for the Rhode Island state budget: the two businesses accounted for $321 million of revenue in the budget year that ended June 30, 2012 -- about 10 percent of all revenue. So will 900 jobs be lost if Question 1 is rejected? Only if Twin River shuts down completely. It turns out that 900 is roughly the number of workers that Twin River says it employs now. If the referendum is rejected, Twin River will continue operating. In the short term, the first Massachusetts casino is not expected to open its doors for a few years. And even with the Bay State casinos up and running, Twin River can be profitable, said Clyde Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at UMass Dartmouth and an expert on gambling in the region. The assumption in the ad is that if voters don't authorize table games Twin River will close, Barrow said. "I don't think that's the case. It's true that once the slot parlor casinos are open in Massachusetts, they do stand to lose as much as 50 percent of their net terminal income," which was $463 million in 2011. "Even if Twin River went to a $225-million-a-year operation, that's still a pretty substantial facility," said Barrow. "It's larger than some of the casinos in Atlantic City. So it will definitely have the capacity to still be profitable at a smaller level of operation." "They would certainly have to lay some people off," said Barrow, "But it wouldn't be the full 900." We also checked a report commissioned by Gov. Lincoln Chafee that included projections of employment at Twin River with and without table games under various scenarios. In the worst-case scenario, where at least one Massachusetts casino is built near Rhode Island, Twin River would have 397 fewer jobs in 2017 than in 2011 if table games aren't permitted. With table games, the loss would be cut to 118 jobs. But that's just the worst scenario. The report says the likeliest outcome is that 319 jobs would be lost if table games were not allowed, and 201 jobs would be gained if Question 1 were to be passed. Under any scenario, that's not close to 900 jobs. When we contacted Twin River, spokeswoman Patti Doyle said that if there are no table games in Rhode Island, Twin River expects to lose 25 percent to 35 percent of its gambling revenue when Massachusetts casinos open. Twin River expects the competition to be on line by late 2016 or early 2017. "A gaming revenue decline at Mohegan Sun and Atlantic City brought nearly a parallel reduction in work force," she said. "So, it's safe to assume that a loss of revenue of 25 percent would translate into a 25 percent loss of our workforce." A 25 percent to 35 percent reduction would result in cuts of 225 to 315 jobs, not 900. Nonetheless, Doyle says Twin River isn't suggesting that the gambling complex might have to close its doors. "That's not what the ads are saying, nor are we saying that now," she wrote in an e-mail. "We can say with certainty with table game approval, none of the existing 900 jobs will be lost." But that's not what the ad says, nor how most people will perceive it. Our Ruling The Coalition to Bring Jobs to R.I., an organization pushing for approval of a referendum question to permit table games at Twin River, says that passage would save 900 jobs in Rhode Island. But the only way 900 jobs would be lost at Twin River would be if it closed, and nobody -- including Twin River -- is saying that's going to happen. Even if Twin River had to scale back its operation by 25 percent to 35 percent, that's not close to the 900 positions that Jobs to R.I. says are at risk. Because the company -- based on its own estimates -- is overplaying its hand, offering a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04101	Says in "our region," 2011 was worst drought year ever recorded.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/15/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-our-region-2011-was-worst-drought/	Two state senators urged the Lower Colorado River Authority to dispense water carefully in an opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 31, 2012. "Our region is facing an emergency situation with the ongoing and ever-worsening drought: 2011 was the most severe year of drought ever recorded," wrote Sens. Kirk Watson and Troy Fraser. Statewide, 2011 was a record year -- specifically "the worst single-year drought on record," according to a March 23, 2012, Statesman news story. In a Dec. 31, 2011, wrapup of the year’s biggest local news stories, Statesman editors put the drought at No. 2: Crops wilted, lake levels dropped, lawns turned brown, and wildlife went thirsty as Texas endured record drought. At one point in October, 88 percent of the state was deemed to be in exceptional drought, the most severe level. Austin received just less than 15 inches of rain, about half of its normal precipitation, and sweated through a record 90 days of triple-digit temperatures." So not all areas suffered to the same degree. Was the drought as harsh here as elsewhere? First, we checked to make sure what region the senators meant. Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal told us by email that it would be fair to say they meant counties in the river authority's jurisdiction in and around the Austin area (Watson’s District 14 takes in Bastrop County and most of Travis County) and upriver in Fraser’s District 24. We figured that’s probably about the impression Statesman readers got from the words "our region," given that the context was senators discussing the river authority. So we based our fact-finding on Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop counties around Austin, plus Burnet, Blanco, Lampasas, Gillespie, Llano, San Saba and Brown counties upstream. We looked at 11 counties. Click to view larger map Scheibal sent us links to 2011-12 newsletters and reports from the river authority and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality that described record-setting drought across Texas and dry months in the Lower Colorado river basin. To get a closer look, we spoke via phone and email with state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, an atmospheric science professor at Texas A&M University. Drought, he told us, can be defined by factors including lack of rainfall, length of time and impact on people and crops. Factoring in duration, for example, the most severe Texas drought remains the 1950-1957 drought, which an Aug. 14, 2011, Statesman news story said "reshaped Texas, ruining thousands of farmers and ranchers and pushing rural residents to migrate out of the country and into the cities." That was the worst extended drought since reliable state records began in the 1890s, though a 2011 study of Texas cypress tree rings showed several longer, harsher droughts over the past 500 years. To help us judge the "most severe year of drought" in the 11-county region, Nielsen-Gammon checked rainfall data recorded there for each "water year" back to 1893. Water years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, he said, beginning with the period when most rainfall accumulates and ending after peak water use. The key is "how much water you end up with at the end of the summer," he said. In rainfall, Nielsen-Gammon told us, 2011 was the second-worst "water year" (Oct. 1 to Sept. 30) in those 11 counties since 1893. The lowest rainfall came in 1956. But the drought was more severe in 2011, he said, because summer temperatures averaged 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit above those of 1956, "increasing the need for water by plants while simultaneously evaporating water from reservoirs." So, according to Nielsen-Gammon, the 2011 water year was the worst 12-month drought ever recorded in the 11-county region. The 2011 calendar year would also have been the worst recorded, he said, measured by the river authority’s records of water flowing into the Highland Lakes: Buchanan, Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls, Travis and Austin, of which lakes Buchanan and Travis are reservoirs supplying water customers. According to a Jan. 8, 2013, river authority report sent us by Scheibal, 2011 saw the lowest-ever recorded water flow (from creeks and other tributaries) into the Highland Lakes. We confirmed that with river authority spokeswoman Clara Tuma, who told us its records began in 1942, after the construction of Mansfield Dam created Lake Travis. Nielsen-Gammon told us that although it would take "some sort of major rain" to get the river authority’s water levels back up to normal, the rainfall picture for 2012 was better overall, with precipitation near or above normal levels. Forecasts for 2013 are a still a toss-up, both he and Tuma said. The river authority posted an update Jan. 9, 2012, with data and an interactive map from the National Drought Mitigation Service showing the region still in "Severe Drought." Our ruling Watson said 2011 was the worst drought year in "our region." In records dating to 1893 for the general area indicated, 2011 was the most severe single-year drought by rainfall combined with evaporation, and it also saw the lowest recorded water-flow into the Highland Lakes. Watson’s statement is True.	None	Kirk Watson	None	None	None	2013-01-15T13:40:38	2012-12-31	['None']

pomt-08576	Says Rand Paul thinks drug-dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution should be decriminalized.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/jack-conway/jack-conway-campaign-ad-accuses-rand-paul-being-so/	Accusing your opponent of being soft on crime is pretty standard campaign fare, but Kentucky Democrat Jack Conway -- a candidate for U.S. Senate -- takes things one step further in a campaign video, using a two-year-old quote from Republican opponent Rand Paul to suggest Paul wants to decriminalize everything from drug dealing and burglary to prostitution. The ad begins with a clip of the Paul quote in question: "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." It then cuts to an image of Bernie Madoff with the question, "Should Wall Street Fraudster Bernie Madoff not be in jail?" A uniformed law enforcement officer then asks, "What about meth and drug dealers?" Cut to another officer..."theft, burglary...promoting prostitution..." And then back to Paul saying, "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." Another version of the Conway ad follows the same theme. "Thinks non-violent crime should be against the law? That's crazy," one uniformed officer says. "It should be a crime if you sells drugs to a minor," says another cop. Then others..."...Wall Street fraud. Mortgage fraud...burglary...someone that's promoting prostitution...theft." The implication is clear: Paul wants to legalize all non-violent crime, including drug dealing, theft, burglary and prostitution. On the campaign trail, Paul has repeatedly denounced the ad, and his campaign promptly put out a press release boasting that a number of county sheriffs had publicly declared their support for his campaign. "I think it's a dishonest ad, would be the first thing I'd say," Paul said in a Sept. 16, 2010, interview on Fox41 in Kentucky. "What we were discussing a couple years ago on KET was whether or not things like motorcycle helmets and the lottery should be illegal because they’re immoral or because they're unsafe. And my point was that there are certain things adults can make decisions on. "What that ad does is, he totally distorts it and wants to say I want to allow minors to use drugs, it is an absolute falsehood." Paul went even further in a Fox News interview on Sept. 19, 2010, calling the ad "a lie." Paul again explained that he was a pundit panelist on a program called Kentucky Tonight on Nov. 24, 2008, and that the context of the discussion was not crime at all, but rather was "about helmet laws for adults and whether adults should have the right to either gamble or buy lottery tickets. And the comparison between lottery tickets and gambling. And it really had nothing to do with drugs or drugs for minors, or all these things, prostitution..." "So," the interviewer interjected, "you think those things should be illegal, Dr. Paul?" "Yes," Paul said. "And I'm not proposing any changes in the drug laws or laws against prostitution." We listened to the entirety of the Kentucky Tonight program on the night in question, and Paul is correct that the focus was on whether the state ought to place higher taxes on things like cigarettes or alcohol. Paul made it clear he didn't think that was the government's place. "Do we want our tax commissioner to be the moral commissioner of sin?" Paul said on the program. "Where does it stop?" Paul said, throwing out the example of whether the government ought to put an extra $1 tax on a McDonald's quarter pounder to help curb obesity. "It really isn't our job to tell people whether they should smoke or not," Paul said. "It's not our job to tell people whether they should eat too much or not. We're a free society where individuals can decide what they want to decide." In the course of the discussion, Paul talked about whether the government should regulate whether someone should be able to ride a bike or motorcycle without a helmet. And what about gambling? he asked, noting that, "It's OK to gamble on the lottery, just not slot machines." "I'm against legislating morality," Paul said. "I mean, I'm for crimes and having laws against things that are violent crimes. But things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." So there's the fuller context. John Collins, a spokesman for the Conway campaign, said Paul's words speak for themselves. "Rand Paul believes drugs aren't a pressing issue and that non-violent crimes, such as prostitution and selling drugs, shouldn’t be against the law," Collins said. "If Paul thinks that’s misleading, then he should not have said it. Simply put, you could hold a meeting of all the people who agree with Rand Paul’s soft on crime beliefs in a phone booth." We asked Collins for evidence to support the claim that Paul believes selling drugs, for example, shouldn't be against the law. He pointed us to a series of quotes in which Paul espouses the opinion that issues of crime are better addressed at the state and local, rather than federal, government level. So, for example, he has said that issues like whether to legalize medical marijuana ought to be decided by states, and that the funding for drug enforcement ought to come from state and local governments. Those may be controversial positions, but they are a far cry from Paul saying he believes that drug dealing and burglary ought not to be against the law. We asked Collins if he could point us toward any other quotes from Paul that suggest he doesn't think drug dealing, burglary and prostitution, for example, should not be against the law. He referred us only to Paul's two-year-old quote, "The things that are non-violent shouldn't be against the law." Certainly Paul could have chosen his words more carefully. But this strikes us as more of a political "gotcha" than a legitimate issue. The quote comes in the context of Paul discussing the propriety of government involvement in issues such as cigarette or alcohol taxes, gambling and wearing a motorcycle helmet. Paul said what he said. But for the Conway campaign to splice that with comments from law enforcement officials listing non-violent crime such as dealing drugs to kids, promoting prostitution, theft, burglary and financial crime suggests Paul wants to decriminalize those acts. We couldn't find a single instance where Paul has said he specifically wanted to legalize any of those activities. Conversely, Paul has repeatedly and unequivocally said he does not want to make those things legal, and that he has no plans to change the current laws with regard to them. We think a reasonable person can see what's going on here. We rate this ad False.	None	Jack Conway	None	None	None	2010-09-27T12:13:35	2010-09-14	['None']
