2	Why did Earth's surface temperature stop rising in the past decade ...	Nov 8, 2013 ... Starting in the mid-1970s, global temperatures rose 0.5 °C over a period of 25  years. Since the turn of the century, however, the change in Earth's global mean  surface temperature has been close to zero. Yet despite the halt in acceleration,  each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at ...	https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/why-did-earth%E2%80%99s-surface-temperature-stop-rising-past-decade

4	How Much More Will Earth Warm?	Based on a range of plausible emission scenarios, average surface temperatures  could rise between 2°C and 6°C by the end of the 21st century. ... So far, most of  the atmosphere has maintained a near constant balance between temperature  and water vapor concentration as temperatures have gone up in recent decades.	https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page5.php

9	The Greenhouse Effect	At this point you may be asking how we can speak of  global warming  when  we have just stated that the Earth (as seen from space) MUST stay at the same  temperature? And how is it that the temperature of the Earth s surface is only a  chilly 0°F? The key to understanding this apparent contradiction is to remember  that ...	http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/02_1.shtml

BETWEEN 1998 and 2013, the Earth's surface temperature rose at a rate of 0.04° C a decade, far slower than the 0.18°C increase in the 1990s. Meanwhile,  emissions of carbon dioxide (which would be expected to push temperatures up)  rose uninterruptedly.
