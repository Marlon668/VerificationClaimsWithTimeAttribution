obry-00059	In her bid to retake the 85th Assembly District seat, Democrat Mandy Wright has repeatedly underscored her background as an educator. Drawing on her experience working as a teacher in Wausau, she has criticized what she sees as Republican attacks on education in the state. She also has highlighted funding cuts in her district. When Wright announced her run in a Nov. 6, 2015 op-ed in the Wausau Daily Herald, she attacked GOP support of voucher schools and argued that the program draws resources away from public schools in her own district. “Just in the 85th Assembly District, we’re spending half a million taxpayer dollars on private school tuition for students that often attended those private schools already. That money is needed in our public schools, where there is public oversight for public funds and all children are welcome.” So how much money does the Wausau School District spend on vouchers? Which children are benefiting from that spending? The Observatory decided to look and find out. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/10/27/how-much-money-flows-to-voucher-schools-in-the-85th-assembly-district/	None	None	None	Andrew Bahl	None	How much money flows to voucher schools in the 85th Assembly District?

obry-00020	Democrat Kathleen Vinehout released a Jan. 24 statement prior to Gov. Scott Walker’s State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature. In it, she contended, “Wages are 18th lowest in the country. We are last in business startups. We are third worst for affordable family-based infant childcare, making holding a job difficult and expensive.” Vinehout is a member of the Wisconsin Senate from Alma. She is currently running for governor in a crowded Democratic field against the Republican Walker. The Observatory fact-checked Vinehout’s statement as three separate claims — that wages in Wisconsin are 18th lowest in the country; that Wisconsin is last in business startups; and that the state has the third least affordable family-based infant child care. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/03/20/vinehouts-critique-of-wisconsin-wages-child-care-costs-and-startup-activity-largely-hold-up/	None	None	None	Teodor Teofilov	None	Vinehout’s critique of Wisconsin wages, child-care costs and startup activity largely hold up	March 20, 2018	None	['Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
obry-00030	When the United States was hit with a recession nearly a decade ago, Wisconsin was not spared from widespread economic downturn and unemployment. But in the years following the Great Recession, Wisconsin’s unemployment rates have been looking up. The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development released a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics June 22 outlining the state’s unemployment statistics. Four months later, now-Sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, penned a column published in the Green Bay Press-Gazette boasting Wisconsin’s low unemployment rate statistics. “Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is at 4.2 percent and our state now has a record number of people working. Workers who want full-time employment are now having an easier time finding it,” Tiffany wrote. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/12/19/examining-wisconsins-unemployment-rates/	None	None	None	Hayley Sperling	None	Examining Wisconsin’s unemployment rates	December 20, 2016	None	['United_States', 'Wisconsin', 'Great_Recession']
obry-00055	Mark Holbrook, Democratic candidate for Wisconsin’s 70th assembly district, claimed on his campaign website that his GOP opponent was complicit in a $250 million budget cut to the UW system pushed by Gov. Scott Walker. Holbrook said, “In addition, our representative (Nancy VanderMeer) voted to preserve the $250 million cut to the UW System and Colleges: one of the highest cuts to higher education in the country.” Lawmakers voted 52-46 to pass the 2015-17 biennial budget, which included $250 million worth of cuts to the UW system over a two-year period, alongside the removal of protections for tenured faculty. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/02/holbrook-ties-vandermeer-to-massive-uw-cuts/	None	None	None	Peter Culver	None	Holbrook ties VanderMeer to massive UW cuts	November 11, 2016	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)', 'University_of_Wisconsin_System', 'Legislator', 'Wisconsin']
obry-00039	While campaigning against Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, Katie McGinty, a Democrat , accused her Republican opponent of acting on a conflict of interest while serving on Senate banking committee. Toomey won reelection by less than a two-percent margin. McGinty claimed that Toomey used his position on the committee to oppose consumer protection measures while owning over half a million dollars in stock in a bank that was engaged in controversial foreclosure methods. When asked by reporters with the Philadelphia Inquirer, McGinty could not point to any direct evidence supporting her claim. “He opposed consumer protections to prevent predatory practices. Now we know why,” McGinty said in a phone call with the Philadelphia Inquirer. McGinty is implying that Toomey, who repeatedly voted against legislation to increase consumer protection from predatory bank practices, did so because of his personal stake in a bank engaging in practices considered controversial. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/18/democratic-challenger-accuses-incumbent-toomey-of-conflict-of-interest/	None	None	None	Evan Winter and Peter Culver	None	Democratic challenger accuses incumbent Toomey of conflict of interest	November 18, 2016	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'The_Philadelphia_Inquirer', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Pat_Toomey', 'Pennsylvania']
obry-00035	As the state minimum wage rose toward the top of the policy agenda in the most recent election season, Wisconsin Assembly Democrats have indicated they will look to increase wages in the upcoming legislative session. During an Aug. 29 interview with WisconsinEye, recently re-elected Rep. Dave Considine, D-Baraboo, advocated for raising Wisconsin’s minimum wage to $15 an hour — more than double the current rate of $7.25 an hour — over the course of up to six years. Qualifying his statement, Considine said the change should include an age-based tier system in which the hourly rate is higher for adults than it is for minors. He also said that many employers already paid above the current minimum wage. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/12/14/how-much-do-workers-in-central-wisconsin-make-we-check-out-dave-considines-estimates/	None	None	None	Madeline Sweitzer	None	How much do workers in central Wisconsin make?

obry-00042	Wisconsin Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, R-River Falls, was re-elected earlier this month to represent the 10th Senate District, beating Democratic opponent Diane Odeen. On her campaign website, Harsdorf claimed that “Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has been cut by more than half and is consistently lower than the national average.” The Observatory checked whether Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has been cut by more than 50 percent, and whether the Wisconsin unemployment rate has been consistently lower than the national average. In order to check the first part of the claim, we asked Harsdorf’s campaign staff how they arrived at the the estimated reduction in the unemployment rate. They pointed to the difference in unemployment between January 2010 and today. According to Harsdorf’s team, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was 9.2 percent in January 2010, compared to the current unemployment rate of 4.2 percent. 	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/18/harsdorf-claims-wisconsins-unemployment-rate-has-dropped-by-half-has-it/	None	None	None	Paige Scobee	None	Harsdorf claims Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has dropped by half.
